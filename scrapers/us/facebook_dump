1374832002773142	This morning I joined USO to assemble care packages for our service members. I encourage everyone to do what you can to support our military men and women, as well as their families. A simple "thank you" can go a long way.	1606034552986218
1374832002773142	Been another busy day in Washington with a number of meetings between votes and committee meetings.

1374832002773142	In honor of National Police Week, this afternoon I stopped by the Mobile Police Department to thank some of our local officers for their service to our communities. I have deep respect for our local police officers, and I never pass up an opportunity to tell them thank you. I hope you will join me in sharing your appreciation for our local law enforcement agents this week.	1601062460150094
1374832002773142	This morning I visited the Nina Nicks Joseph Child Development Center in downtown Mobile. The center is operated by Child Day Care Association, a United Way Partner Agency.

1374832002773142	Forestry is very important to our area, and this afternoon I met with the Mobile County Landowners Association to give an update from Washington. It was great to see some familiar faces.	1599640186958988

1374832002773142	I'm back in Baldwin County this morning talking to students at Spanish Fort Elementary School. I'm giving an overview of my role in Congress and taking questions from the students. I always love spending time with the young people in our district!	1594056417517365
1374832002773142	This weekend during my visit to Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, I checked out the P-3 Orion. The P-3 is used for anti-sub maritime surveillance missions. Eventually it will be replaced by the P-8.	1592291804360493
1374832002773142	It really is such a small world! While traveling in Washington state with the Navy, I paid a visit to Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. I met Captain Norteir, the commanding officer of Whidbey. His wife is from Butler, Alabama and went to college at South Alabama. I also checked out the EA-18 Growler electronic attack aircraft. All growlers in the Navy are based here at Whidbey.	1591810467741960

Today I went aboard the USS Shoup, a guided missile destroyer, at Naval Station Everett. Thanks to CDR Bryant Trost for the informative tour. Seeing these vessels firsthand is very important to my work on the House Armed Services Committee.	1591682297754777
1374832002773142	Here's some of the highlights from a packed day of meetings in Washington: I visited with the Alabama Restaurant & Hospitality Alliance, including representatives from Mobile and Gulf Shores. Then, I met with a group from the Military Officers Association of America about improving care for our veterans. I also spoke to the American Sportfishing Association about my efforts to fix Red Snapper season. Next, I met with the The Arc of Alabama about ways we can work together to support Alabamians with disabilities. Wrapping things up, I visited with a group of fire chiefs from Alabama, including Chief Joey Darby from Foley. Thanks to all of those who stopped by the office!	1590254067897600
1374832002773142	This past weekend the 2014 and 2015 Dogwood Trail Courts participated in the National Cherry Blossom Parade in Washington. On Friday, my staff and I arranged a special tour for the court members of Mount Vernon, as well as a panel discussion with a group of Alabama women working on Capitol Hill. I was honored for my office to play a small part in this special trip!	1589514361304904
86574174383	Privileged to provide a legislative update to the San Francisco Asian Pacific Islander Council – a coalition of AAPI-serving non-profit organizations. Our roundtable discussed today's disappointing decision by two Fifth Circuit judges to defer the dreams of hard-working immigrant families across America, and also my recent bipartisan congressional delegation trips to Asia, which included visits to Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Korea and Japan.	10153510442319384
86574174383	Thank you to CDR Mike Davies and our Servicemembers for the great tour of the mighty USS Coronado in San Diego!	10153418818954384

86574174383	President Obama’s leadership on calling for an end to so-called "conversion therapies" serves as a clarion call for states to act swiftly to protect the lives of LGBT citizens, especially children and young adults, whose lives and dignity are at risk every time a medical professional or community member refuses to accept them. My full statement: http://goo.gl/9Bs0Cg	10153388126434384
86574174383	Education is the best investment we can make in our children and our nation. At City College of San Francisco today, we spoke about how we ensure higher education is accessible to all. #BankonStudents	10153384150604384
86574174383	Our Congressional delegation was graciously received by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma.

86574174383	The remarkable work by USAID and PEPFAR have Cambodia on track for an AIDS-free generation by 2020. Our Congressional delegation had the privilege of visiting the Wat Thmey Community, an HIV/AIDS care site in Cambodia that is supported by these vital agencies.	10153359489769384
86574174383	Jack Murtha poured everything he had into the service of our country. To watch Chairman Murtha legislate was to see a master at work – but more indicative of his character was to watch him communicate with our men and women in uniform, whether on the battlefield or at their bedside.  Like its namesake, the USS John P. Murtha will provide our servicemen and women the means to enter the battle and to make their way back home.  Today, we joined Jack's daughter, Donna, his wife Joyce, family members and members of military at Ingalls Shipbuilding to christen this ship in memory of Jack’s service, in recognition of his strength, in honor of his unfailing leadership for our county.	10153339975449384
86574174383	Happy Birthday, Girl Scouts! Your leadership, service (and delicious cookies!) inspire us all! Congratulations on 103 years.	10153317556569384
86574174383	At today's Civil Rights Memorial wreath-laying ceremony, we honored those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for justice.	10153306582599384
86574174383	My colleagues and I just heard such moving words from civil rights hero, Congressman John Lewis. Honored to come together on the steps of the 16th Street Baptist Church to reflect upon the tragic bombing in 1963. Let us pray for all our children.	10153301258864384
86574174383	Sharing a few pictures from yesterday's Merchant Walk in San Francisco. On one of many stops, I had the opportunity to present a 'Certificate of Congressional Recognition' to Ryan Allen and Salvador Tovar, co-owners of 'Sparky's Fun & Joy' on their 5th anniversary in the Inner Richmond neighborhood. And of course -- a favorite visit of mine involved a chocolate ice-cream cone from 'Toy Boat Dessert Cafe' owner Jesse Fink on Clement Street.	10153289077574384
86574174383	Amen!\n\n"It’s our time to have wage equality once and for all in the United States of America." \n- Patricia Arquette \n\n#Oscars #WomenSucceed	10153274221859384
86574174383	Visitng Zamni Beni, which was founded after Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake that left so many children in Port-au-Prince vulnerable and homeless.	10153270124649384
86574174383	It was my esteemed pleasure to meet with the Dominican Republic's President, Danilo Medina, President of the Chamber of Deputies, Abel Martínez and other government officials today. We had a very positive and constructive discussion about the future between our two countries.	10153267866554384
86574174383	Our Congressional delegation travels to Cuba in friendship and to build upon the announcement of U.S. normalization of relations and other initiatives announced by President Obama. This delegation will work to advance the U.S.-Cuba relationship and build on the work done by many in the Congress over the years, especially with respect to agriculture and trade.	10153260896624384
86574174383	President Obama and I share the belief that the strength of our society and the success of our economy depend on a strong and growing middle class. I'm very much looking forward to hearing his vision for building upon America's economic progress. #SOTU	10153193409614384
86574174383	Republicans’ first votes in the new Congress have been New Year’s gifts to the wealthy and special interests. House Democrats, on the other hand, are championing a new legislative package to increase paychecks for working families and put Americans back to work building the roads and bridges our country needs – paid for by keeping our tax dollars here at home.	10153193119809384
86574174383	I urge Speaker Boehner and my House Republican colleagues, please don't put the politics of right-wing radicals above the safety of American families. #DontShutDownOurSecurity	10153177777659384
86574174383	House Republicans need to rethink their special-interests-first plan for this Congress. The American people expect Congress to champion the paychecks of middle class families, not the profits of big banks. Wall Street giveaways introduced in the dead of night are no way to govern. Democrats will continue to fight back against Republicans’ Wall Street wish list agenda. Republicans should stop undermining the middle class, and join Democrats to build better infrastructure and bigger paychecks for every American family.	10153163848409384
86574174383	Today, House Democrats voted to put Americans back to work building the roads and bridges our country needs and deliver bigger paychecks to hardworking families. We must have an America that works for everyone, not just the privileged few. I am deeply disappointed that Republicans have spent the first day of the new Congress continuing their relentless special interest giveaways, instead of coming together to support better infrastructure and bigger paychecks for the working people of our country.	10153161483829384
86574174383	May the upcoming year strengthen our resolve to make the future better for our great country. My best wishes to you for a healthy and happy holiday season!	10153104943644384
86574174383	In the spirit of this special holiday, we gratefully pause to wish you a warm and happy Thanksgiving!	10153028785919384
86574174383	On this #VeteransDay, let us salute the indomitable courage and selfless sacrifice of the heroes who have served our nation in uniform -- and let us reaffirm our basic pledge: that just as our soldiers leave no one behind on the battlefield, we must never leave our veterans behind at home.	10152994731184384
86574174383	We must inspire, educate & remove obstacles to political participation as we put the #MiddleClassFirst. That’s why I’m running for Leader.	10152982455894384
92190287786	Dr. Martin Luther King once said: “True peace is not merely the absence of tension, it is the presence of justice.”\n\nTo all those practicing peaceful protest in the #EastBay today: you are the heirs of the civil rights movement. And I am so proud to be your representative. It is only through peaceful protests and community engagement that we will realize the change we seek.	10153295465572787
92190287786	Congratulations to Libby Schaaf on becoming the 50th Mayor of Oakland! I look forward to working with Mayor Schaaf and the Oakland City Council to fight for progressive policies & livable and healthy communities.	10153051819322787
92190287786	More heart-wrenching news today – there will be no indictment in the murder of Eric Garner. Our system is broken. The Department of Justice should act immediately to investigate this tragedy and ensure justice is done.	10152959224142787
92190287786	My heart continues to go out to Michael Brown’s family and community.\n\nI am beyond disappointed in today's verdict. \n\nLike everyone in our community, I am devastated by the senseless murder of yet another young black man.\n\nThe deaths of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin and Oscar Grant, one of my constituents, serve as tragic examples of the senseless murder of young African American men.\n\nI urge protesters to be peaceful and for the police to respect people exercising their First Amendment rights. \n\nWe must come together like never before to tackle the systemic, structural and rampant racial bias endemic in our institutions and criminal justice system. We must demand change and work to realize it.	10152943521827787
92190287786	Glad to see my Senate colleagues standing up for our precious planet and saying no to the #KeystoneXL pipeline.  When Republicans rammed this bill through the House earlier this week, I proudly voted NO. This pipeline endangers our planet and our communities. #NoKXL	10152932455912787

92190287786	Today, the Supreme Court declined to hear seven cases to restrict love & families. With today’s decision, marriage equality becomes a reality in five more states!  #LoveIsLove	10152847732072787
92190287786	By voting to arm Syrian rebels groups, Congress is rushing back into yet another war in the Middle East. We must heed the lessons of the past. Congress must fulfill its constitutional obligation to debate and vote on the authorization of military force. The war-weary American  public deserves an honest debate about the costs and consequences of wading into chaotic sectarian and civil war. It’s time to #StopEndlessWar.	10152810963772787
92190287786	The American people deserve an informed, deliberate debate in Congress before we take any further military action in Iraq. This week, I joined Thom Hartmann to talk about my efforts to bring a vote on ISIS to Congress. Listen here: http://bit.ly/1vP99Nm	10152787096637787
92190287786	California just became the first state in the country to pass a "yes-means-yes" sexual assault prevention bill for colleges and universities. This bill, which defines consent as "affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement," is a huge step forward in creating a safe environment for all students. http://bit.ly/1pqJ9VX	10152774533557787
92190287786	Hope everyone is safe after today's earthquake. Find out what to do after an earthquake: http://www.seismic.ca.gov/after.html	10152763349297787
92190287786	A few photos from Secretary Pritzker’s #CA13 visit. It was great to jumpstart the conversation on capitalizing on America’s diverse businesses – I’m looking forward to working with the Department of Commerce going forward to ensure we’re investing in women and minority-owned businesses. #MakeItInAmerica	10152738247627787
92190287786	Productive meeting at The White House last night with President Barack Obama, VP Joe Biden & House Democrats. Working to improve the lives of all Americans – great way to spend a birthday!	10152687701537787
92190287786	My granddaughters, Giselle, Simone & Jordan Lee. They are a daily inspiration and I couldn't be more proud of who they are. We must be sure to leave them a bright future.	10152686094137787
92190287786	Wonderful having Oakland’s Hawa Zabel in Washington today. She’s the winner of California 13th Congressional Art Competition!	10152645147372787
92190287786	Tonight, an amendment I co-sponsored passed the House which would bring much needed clarity to patients and businesses over enforcement of medical marijuana. I believe we should be protecting and implementing the will of voters and States, not undermining our democracy by prosecuting small business owners who pay taxes and comply with state laws. This is a major victory for California and I salute all the advocates who have worked so hard on this incredible effort for many years.	10152590019602787
92190287786	Join me tomorrow; I'll be on CNN State of the Union to discuss my strong opposition to a military strike in Syria. Hope you can join me at 12noon EST/9am PST.	10152079723457787
79072979038	Some things aren't worth celebrating--including Tax Day (today, April 15).  This caught my attention: each year American families pay almost $32k to fund big government.  Workers and families should be able to keep more of their hard earned money--not less.	10153027697399039
92190287786	Thank you everyone for your robust engagement on my Facebook page. \n\nPlease remember that children and families are part of our Facebook community;  bullying, name-calling, profanity, images depicting graphic violence, etc. are not appropriate and have no space here.  \n\nWe want to ensure that this is a safe space for everyone.	10152077840947787

92190287786	I will join Melissa Harris-Perry on MSNBC tomorrow morning at 7:15 pst/10:15 est am to discuss #Syria.  I hope you can tune in!	10152067896647787
92190287786	While the use of chemical weapons is deeply troubling and unacceptable, I believe there is no military solution to the complex Syrian crisis. Congress needs to have a full debate before the United States commits to any military force in Syria—or elsewhere.	10152060569062787
92190287786	Join me on Sunday morning at 10 am EST for Melissa Harris-Perry on MSNBC. We'll be talking about a whole range of topics--I hope you can tune in for some of it!	10152005973727787
92190287786	We are celebrating Mandela Day today in Berkeley! Come to the Black Repertory Theatre from 3:00-5:00pm to help us celebrate Madiba's 95th birthday and continue his legacy. I hope to see you there!	10151994871002787
92190287786	My thoughts and prayers are with all the famlies and individuals involved in the plane crash at SFO.  No arrivals and departures in/out of SFO for now. Be sure to check with your airline for status updates.	10151968494967787

99332606976	It was great to see so many of you at my "Morning Joe with Jackie" this morning in West Portal in San Francisco! I am always impressed and encouraged when I hear how informed my constituents are. We had conversations about foreign policy, cyber security, trade agreements, education and much more. I feel so privileged to represent the 14th Congressional District.	10153130293206977
99332606976	Happy #WorldOceansDay! These are some of the most gorgeous places in our District. We’re lucky to live and serve in such a place, and we need to make sure we have strong protections in place to keep them beautiful and vibrant.	10153118122956977
99332606976	I've introduced a bill to fight campus sexual violence. \n\nThese are photos from my press conference with bipartisan co-sponsor Congressman Patrick Meehan, Rep. Brenda Lawrence,  and Congressman Jim Costa, as well as advocates and survivors. You can read about the bill here (http://goo.gl/bHR3Qw).\n\nIt’s unacceptable that 20 percent of young women and 6 percent of young men will be victims of attempted or actual sexual assault on campus. \n\nIt’s unacceptable that the National Institute of Justice has estimated that 63 percent of universities shirk their legal responsibilities to respond to these violent crimes.\n\nThis is not news. Sexual violence on our college campuses has been going on for decades. And until recently, when people starting carrying their mattresses in protest and strong young women and men united in their shared concerns, no one paid attention.\n\nOver 40 years have passed since the landmark Title IX legislation became law, yet students still report unequal access to educational opportunities due to sexual harassment and assault on campus. In fact, the Department of Education currently has 123 sexual violence cases under investigation at 113 universities.  \n\nThis epidemic does not know class, race, or US News & World Report Ranking. Three of the top five universities–Harvard, Columbia, and Stanford–are all currently under investigation for Title IX violations.\n\nRape is a crime. Period. We need laws, enforcement, and a culture that treat it that way. That’s why I’m proud to introduce the bipartisan Hold Accountable and Lend Transparency or HALT Campus Sexual Violence Act. This bill will establish the standards and penalties we need to hold schools accountable under Title IX and the Jeanne Clery Act, and give survivors the rights they deserve. \n\nI also want to say thank you. Thank you to my friend and colleague Congressman Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania for joining me to introduce our bipartisan bill today. And thank you to the other members in the room for their support of this bill.\n\nI would also like to thank the advocates from our supporting organizations for standing in solidarity and being available for questions: Lara Kauffman with the National Women’s Law Center; Anne Hedgepeth with the American Association of University Women; Krista Niemczyk with the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence; Debby Bryant with the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence; Dana Bolger with Know Your IX; and Andrea Pino from End Rape on Campus.\n\nWe are standing united against campus sexual assault today because of the efforts of students. These students, many of whom are also sexual assault survivors, have organized and fought–sometimes for years–so that our nation would finally take a hard look at our campus culture. \n\nIt was a group of UC students, including students at Berkeley, whose advocacy prompted the California legislature to audit the University of California and California State University system’s compliance with Title IX.  \n\nIt was students that helped make California the first in the nation to pass “Yes Means Yes” legislation requiring an affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each party to engage in sexual activity.  \n\nAnd it was students that pushed the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights to become more transparent about their investigations. \n\nWe’re also here because we have so much more work to do.  \n\nI’m proud to say that the bipartisan HALT Act is the approach that garners the most support from advocacy groups invested in changing the status quo, many of whom are represented here today. \n\nThe HALT Act constitutes real reform and it is the solution we need, and I urge the House leadership to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor. Our students deserve a vote.	10153111918276977
99332606976	This morning I joined about 200 4th and 5th graders at Audubon Elementary in Foster City and honored them for their short stories printed in the 10th edition of  the Writing Notebook.The writing talent and creative thinking of these young authors are amazing and inspiring.They deserve recognition and encouragement to hone their skills. Reading and writing are not only the foundation for every child’s education, they are also what sets us apart as human beings, the only species possessing those skills. I applaud Audubon Elementary School for maintaining this great program for ten years.	10153062743256977
99332606976	The New York Times and The Rachel Maddow Show have stories on Republican efforts to use the Pentagon spending bill against endangered species, treating the Lesser Prairie Chicken as “a sort of feathery sleeper cell.” Undermining the Endangered Species Act has nothing to do with national security. This is a land giveway to big oil and gas under the thin guise of national security. We should be fighting #ISIL, not the Prairie Chicken. \n\nYou can read the Times piece here (http://goo.gl/FDgLYE) and watch the Maddow segment here (http://goo.gl/1uzF14).	10153059681576977
99332606976	I visited Eastside College Prep in East Palo Alto and talked to a group of mostly juniors and seniors about gun violence and police violence. When I asked them how many had not been touched by gun violence in their immediate circle, only a handful of students raised their hands. This great school is giving students access to a good education and opening the door to college.	10153031701766977

99332606976	Conversion therapy is quackery--you can't "cure" or "treat" sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. I applaud the president for his strong stance against it today. I look forward to working with the The White House when I reintroduce the Stop Harming Our Kids (SHOK) Resolution in the coming weeks.

99332606976	Today I spoke at a press conference supporting the #Armenian Genocide Truth and Justice Resolution. Almost 100 years ago, the #Ottoman Empire hatched a systematic plan aimed at "solving the Armenian problem" by killing over 1.5 million Armenians they considered traitorous #Christians. My ancestors were among those executed.\n\nThey rounded up the promising thinkers, artists, and businessmen in each province and executed them. They death-marched Armenians from their villages without food or water, shooting them in cold blood, raping them, splitting their heads open with axes. A huge number perished along the way, but the rest were left to die in huge open-air camps or the bare desert.\n\nThis terrible crime is established history, and it's long past time for the United States to acknowledge it.	10152874918956977

139773069370563	Congratulations to Martae Coleman of Bellflower on receiving an appointment from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) Academy to join the Academy’s Class of 2019!  I was very pleased to nominate Martae for appointment to the Academy, and have presented him with a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition as he prepares to depart for basic training at the Academy this month.\n\nSince 2009, when Martae attended the Aviation Career Education Program at the Compton/Woodley Airport, his goal has been to become a pilot.  At the USAF Academy, he will have the opportunity to become a pilot and to get a degree.  Best of luck, Martae!  We’re all rooting for your success at the Academy and beyond.	1104012139613313
99332606976	Today I'm recognizing the #BuffaloSoldiers with Representative Barbara Lee--I'm extremely proud of the legislation I passed to commemorate them.\n\nThese U.S. cavalrymen were assigned to watch over Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks, helping to lay the groundwork so that some of our greatest wilderness could be protected forever.\n\nWithout knowing it, many Californians have been to the very places where the Buffalo Soldiers once made camp. The Buffalo Soldiers were the Army's first peacetime all-black regiments, established by Congress in the late 1800s. In the latter half of the 19th century, the soldiers were stationed at the Presidio. Their mission was to protect lands in what would later become Sequoia and Yosemite national parks. Each May, they rode south along El Camino Real through San Mateo County, embarking on a 13-day trip covering 280 miles from San Francisco to Yosemite. The trek to Sequoia spanned 320 miles and took 16 days.\n\nThese soldiers were true pioneers. They blazed trails, built roads, and protected lands for visitors. They helped make the dream of our national parks a reality. More than 100 years later, one of the roads they built is still in use as a Sequoia National Park hiking trail.\n\nWe are proud that the Buffalo Soldiers traveled through the Bay Area, and proud that our legislation, the Buffalo Soldiers in the National Parks Study Act, recently became law when we included it in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. Our bill instructs the National Park Service to study and commemorate the Buffalo Soldiers' legacy in our parks. Creating a national historic trail that marks the route traveled by the Buffalo Soldiers is an excellent place to begin acknowledging their contributions to California and to our nation as a whole.\n\nAll Americans, from all walks of life, would benefit from learning about this often-overlooked chapter in our history. The Buffalo Soldiers’ story is ultimately about the triumph not just of African American troops over prejudice and injustice, but the movement of our nation toward a more tolerant and courageous society.\n\nHappy 115th birthday to Colonel Charles Young, leader of the Buffalo Soldiers. We will continue working to ensure that your legacy is more fully incorporated into the Parks system that you and your compatriots served and protected.	10152857605986977

99332606976	The new movable median barrier on the Golden Gate Bridge will prevent head on accidents that cause deaths and serious injuries. Dr. Grace Dammann, a brilliant and dedicated physician, was one of those who was injured. She turned her injury into advocacy and spoke during the dedication ceremony today on behalf of all of us who love the bridge and who now will be safer because of this life-saving barrier.	10152701348991977
99332606976	Today should be all about Senator Barbara Boxer and her remarkable career. Senator Boxer’s unrelenting advocacy for improving the environment, women’s rights and justice is unmatched in the Congress. She has been a champion for California, as one of our state’s strong female representatives in Washington for more than 30 years. It has been an honor to work with her to promote the views of our constituents in both chambers.\n\nI have always admired Senator Boxer’s fearlessness and strength. She never shrinks from a fight. Whether exposing the waste at the Department of Defense, preventing oil companies from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or holding her colleagues to the high ethical standard the American people expect, she has stood tall and strong like a redwood tree in the face of powerful Washington interest. She will leave behind a proud legacy of achievements for women, families, consumers, and the environment.	10152693391506977

99332606976	Finally! After 50 years we are normalizing relations with #Cuba. This ends a policy of isolation that we’ve had since President John F. Kennedy. Cuba is mere miles from Miami, but for five decades now it has felt a world away. We can’t keep doing the same thing and expect a new result – we’re the only country that still has an embargo in place against Cuba, and we keep renewing it without reflecting on its results. It’s important to remember that we’ve been occupying a part of the country since the 1930s. Guantanamo Bay has been a reminder of our mixed past with Cuba. Normalizing relations is the right thing to do, and opens a new chapter between our nations. It’s is the best way that we can promote human rights, democracy, peace, and security in nations around the world: through earnest relations and open dialogue. \n\nThe #President’s announcement comes as we welcome home Alan Gross, a #USAID contractor who has been imprisoned for five years, and an unnamed intelligence asset who has been held for two decades. Now it’s up to Congress to take action on the Cuban Embargo, something the President cannot do. It will be up to us to debate and discuss the best way to continue engaging with Cuba.	10152618706876977
99332606976	I would like to set the record straight and reiterate the rules of my Facebook page. I do not believe nor did I say that the CIA should apologize to terrorists. In the interview with Craig Melvin on MSNBC, I said that the CIA should apologize to the Senate Intelligence Committee for eavesdropping on them. I stand by that statement. I am astonished by the level of hatred and vitriol in some of the comments that people have posted on my Facebook page about something I never said. Those comments are in response to second-hand reports that are untrue. I encourage you to watch the interview for yourself.\nOf course you have the right to disagree with me on any number of issues and I welcome other opinions on my Facebook page. I encourage open and productive dialogue. The key word here is dialogue, not hate speech, vicious attacks and threats. \nAs clearly stated on my page: Anyone may participate. - Offensive material will be deleted and repeat spammers will be blocked. - From time to time, older posts are removed.\nI am not accepting any more comments on something I didn't say.	10152612303876977
99332606976	My thoughts go out to those families who have been impacted by Tropical Depression #Hagupit. The pictures coming from the #Philippines evoke memories of last year, when Super Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda devastated the country. The global community came together to help those affected by this disaster, and I am pleased to see the aid and preparation has made a difference. While Hagupit may mean "smash" or "lash" in Filipino, what began as a typhoon weakened as it approached a much more prepared Philippines. Hagupit still claimed the lives of 27 people, and my heart is heavy for the loss of their loved ones. I stand with the strong Filipino community in my district, one of the largest in our nation, as the people of the Philippines rebuild and heal.	10152603147141977

450130878375355	Torture is not an American value.  As Senator Feinstein so courageously said today after releasing her report on the CIA and torture, "America is big enough to admit when it was wrong, and confident enough to learn from its mistakes." We can fight terrorism and keep America safe without resorting to the brutal techniques of our enemy.  We must always be the country that wears the white hat and does the right thing.	787030714685368
450130878375355	I’m disappointed that the opportunity to end Iran’s nuclear program has been further delayed by continued negotiations.

The time to act is now, and we must do so to ensure a safer and more peaceful world.	781920921863014

15675385380	Today, we celebrate the third anniversary of one of the most important achievements in immigration reform: the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). In my own district, I have seen and heard from the young people who benefited directly from this program and have been able to join our community. Their pursuit of the American Dream is a reminder that immigration reform is still needed after Republican leadership failed to bring comprehensive immigration reform to the floor for a vote. As we celebrate the countless opportunities that DACA has provided, let us not forget the 5 million immigrants who have yet to benefit from the expanded DACA and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) programs that are held up in the courts. Today is a reminder that bringing individuals out from the shadows and into the light will benefit us all, as I have seen firsthand how much the DACA fellows I have welcomed to my congressional office have contributed to the work we do in Congress.	10155750732215381

15675385380	I voted NO on #TPA. It was impossible for me to support TPA #FastTrack authority. The TPA bill did not include a voice for working families and prevents Congress from adequately representing the legitimate business and environmental concerns of American workers, investors, and businesses.

15675385380	I voted NO on #TAA. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program has provided crucial benefits to over 2 million workers since its creation in 1974.  In our district alone, 11,779 workers who lost their jobs as a result of free trade agreements have benefited from the TAA program since 2009. I'm a firm supporter of having a robust and inclusive TAA program, but today’s bill underfunds the TAA program by over 20%, failing to provide the funds necessary to provide benefits for eligible displaced workers. The bill also fails to cover public sector workers that lose their jobs as a result of offshoring and it extends the devastating Medicare sequester cuts.	10155736367530381

It is tragic and unconscionable that these women were trapped inside the factory with no chance for survival.

These are human rights that must be respected everywhere in the world.\n\nhttp://www.womeninandbeyond.org/?p=18682	10155627556525381
15675385380	Proud to keynote at USAID - US Agency for International Development last week to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. We need greater investment in development as a key pillar of US engagement worldwide. I had the opportunity to speak with USAID's Acting Administrator Lenhardt, and newly-nominated Gayle Smith, on the US response in post-Nepal earthquake. We must ensure women and girls are prioritized and protected in US responses in disaster relief and recovery.

15675385380	To commemorate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, Senator Mazie Hirono and I introduced a resolution that recognizes and celebrates the 40th Anniversary of the Southeast Asian American community in the U.S. Over the past 40 years, Southeast Asian Americans have become an integral part of the social and economic fabric of our country. They left war-torn nations, tyrannical regimes, and even genocides, to make better lives for themselves and their children. Since their arrival, they have contributed to our armed forces, arts, business, and politics. I am grateful for their enormous impact in my own district of Silicon Valley. This resolution honors their struggles in coming to America, and thanks them for all they’ve done – and continue to do – for our country. #HRes240 #APA #Heritage	10155581413900381
15675385380	Hoy celebramos Cinco de Mayo, también conocido como el Día de la Batalla de Puebla. En 1862, el ejército mexicano fue superado en números y mal equipado y se enfrentó con una fuerza invasora francesa tres veces su tamaño cerca dela ciudad de Puebla. Sin embargo, el ejército mexicano venció decisivamente al ejército francés, en ese tiempo reconocido como el mejor del mundo. La victoria dio ánimo al ejército y al pueblo mexicano en su lucha por permanecer una nación independiente. Este Cinco de Mayo, celebramos el valor y el sacrificio de aquellos ciudadanos mexicanos quienes lucharon por su derecho a la libertad y la independencia y reconocemos las contribuciones de mexicoamericanos a nuestro país. ¡Feliz Cinco de Mayo!	10155578982685381
139773069370563	Now that the Police Commission has issued its decision in the tragic death of Ezell Ford, we must remember that this is just one step in the process to ensure our law enforcement system is worthy of Angelenos’ trust.  We have come a long way, but we have a long way to go.  We must continue our work to ensure that our communities of color and our law enforcement officials are able to engage in open dialogue and work together to make Los Angeles a better and fairer place to live.	1102450119769515

15675385380	Today we celebrate Cinco de Mayo, also known as the Day of the Battle of Puebla. In 1862, a severely outnumbered and poorly equipped Mexican Army met an invading French force three-times its size near the town of Puebla. Despite the disadvantages, the Mexicans decisively defeated the French army, at the time considered the best in the world. The victory represented a significant morale boost for the Mexican army, and Mexican people, in their struggle to remain an independent nation. This Cinco de Mayo, we honor the valor and sacrifice of those Mexican citizens who stood up for their right to freedom and self-governance, and salute the contributions that Mexican Americans have made to our country. Feliz Cindo de Mayo!	10155578783535381
15675385380	I'm proud of President Obama. On Thursday he became the first President to recognize that transgender people should have a right to adopt by including "gender identity" in his Presidential Proclamation for National Foster Care Month. No transgender person should be denied the right to adopt simply for being themselves.  I share the President's belief that "all young people, regardless of what they look like, which religion they follow, who they love, or the gender they identify with, deserve the chance to dream and grow in a loving, permanent home."	10155566112800381
15675385380	Wonderful discussion at yesterday’s Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) meeting with Education Secretary Arne Duncan.  I urged the Department of Education to continue working towards better, disaggregated data on AAPI student performance.  Right now, the Department of Education classifies all AAPI students as ‘Asian.’ However, we know that important differences exist between different AAPI groups. Reporting on differences between those groups, such as Native Hawaiian and Korean students, will give us valuable information to better meet the needs of our students.  My All Students Count Act would fix this problem, and I look forward to working with Secretary Duncan to advance data disaggregation efforts.	10155563132410381
15675385380	I am deeply saddened by the sudden and unexpected passing of my dear friend Richard Choi Bertsch. Richard was a leading figure in the Korean American community, a mentor to many, and one of the most selfless people I’ve ever known. His devotion to his family, and to his causes, including the “comfort women” issue, were unmatched. I will miss him. My condolences go out to his family, and to everyone who had the privilege of calling him “friend.”	10155549769790381

15675385380	Today’s historic confirmation, after an inexcusable delay, of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General is a huge victory for the American people. She is an experienced prosecutor with an incredible judicial background. At a time when civil rights, civil liberties, and law enforcement accountability are on the minds of all Americans, I am proud to know that our country’s chief law enforcement officer has a lifetime of proven commitment to fairness and justice within our system of laws. I’m looking forward to the great work she will do leading the Justice Department.	10155532480745381
15675385380	Glad to hear from experts about a comprehensive solution to combatting #ISIL and extremism at today’s Congressional Progressive Caucus hearing. Military action alone is not the answer. We need to have a national debate on a comprehensive strategy to combat and work towards a lasting, inclusive future away from extremism.	10155384408900381
15675385380	I'm proud to announce that EPA awarded the California State Coastal Conservancy and its partners $1 million grant to restore 290 acres of tidal marsh by breaching levees and improving 60 acres of open water pond habitat for migratory birds, creating self-sustaining tidal wetlands and a transitional zone to accommodate sea level rise. The San Francisco Estuary Partnership/Association of Bay Area Governments and its partners received a $1.7 million grant to upgrade GIS tools that will help track green infrastructure in the Bay Area to improve water quality.

174979964227	As an Assyrian Christian and first-generation American whose family escaped religious persecution and violence in the Middle East, I am deeply concerned by the violence and discrimination that Christians are subjected to in Iraq and throughout the Middle East.\n\nI’ve introduced a bipartisan resolution with Representative Fortenberry, calling for urgent international intervention on behalf of Iraqi civilians facing a dire humanitarian crisis and severe persecution in the Nineveh Plain region of Iraq. This resolution condemns the religious bigotry of armed extremists in Iraq, calls on the President and Secretary of State to help the government of Iraq come up with a humanitarian strategy to combat this violence, and develop a strategy of assistance for religious and ethnic minorities subject to violence and discrimination in the region.	10152595343684228
174979964227	Today, National Journal Magazine chose me as one of “25 Women Who Shape National Policy” as a national technology policy leader. From net neutrality to public safety to broadband adoption, technology policy is improving the lives of millions of Americans and is an engine of economic growth. It’s an honor to be recognized, but an even greater honor to see the benefits of good policy pay off for the American people.	10152595234139228
174979964227	The recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court involving the chain store, Hobby Lobby, grossly assaults women’s health. It gives bosses of closely-held companies a legal right to cite their religious belief as grounds to deny their employees access to insurance coverage for birth control.\n\nI’ve cosponsored legislation in the House to reverse the Court’s ruling. Health care decisions should be made by the patient in consultation with her doctor, not by her boss, a politician, or an unelected judge.	10152564427574228

139773069370563	Today is #WorldDayAgainstChildLabor -- a day to reflect on the plight of hundreds of millions of boys and girls throughout the world who are engaged in work that deprives them of adequate education, health care, and basic freedoms.  That is why I chose this day to re-introduce my Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE), which will raise U.S. labor standards and protections for children working in agriculture to the same level set for children in all other industries.  (It will retain current exemptions for family farms and agricultural education programs.)\n\nOur labor laws allow children to work in agriculture at younger ages and with fewer restrictions than in any other industry.  My CARE Act will bring America's #ChildLabor laws into line with our values, and give all of our children the fundamental protections they need and deserve.	1104071329607394
174979964227	Dear friends,\n\nAs a lover of history and all that is written about our nation and its forefathers, I thought you might enjoy how prescient George Washington was in his farewell address to the nation. As we are bearing witness to troubled times in our country, I think you will draw as much from this quotation as I have. The enclosed is an excerpt from Daniel Webster’s speech, “The Character of Washington,” on the occasion of the one hundredth birthday of George Washington:\n\n“Among other admonitions, Washington has left us, in his last communication to his country, an exhortation against the excesses of party spirit. A fire not to be quenched, he yet conjures us not to fan and feed the flame. Undoubtedly, Gentlemen, it is the greatest danger of our system and of our time. Undoubtedly, if that system should be overthrown, it will be the work of excessive party spirit, acting on the government, which is dangerous; for government then becomes nothing but organized party, and, in the strange vicissitudes of human affairs, it may come at last, perhaps, to exhibit the singular paradox of government itself being in opposition to its own powers, at war with the very elements of its own existence.\n\n“Such cases are hopeless. As men may be protected against murder, but cannot be guarded against suicide, so government may be shielded from the assaults of external foes, but nothing can save it when it chooses to lay violent hands on itself.”	10151920248604228
174979964227	Lockdown has been lifted after a reported shooting on Capitol grounds in Washington, D.C. Ever thankful to the first responders on scene who have stabilized the incident. My staff and I are all safe.	10151917567799228
174979964227	Generations of Americans have fought for the preeminent promise of our country—that every person is afforded the same fundamental rights as stated in our Constitution, with the promise of liberty and justice for all. \n\nToday, the decisions of the Supreme Court make real the words and the promise of our Constitution by striking down unfair barriers for same-sex couples and returning marriage equality to California. Now, the fullness of our Constitution reaches into the lives of millions of Americans, making our nation a more perfect union.	10151696975849228
174979964227	Here is a little mythbuster for everyone on the impact of the Affordable Care Act on jobs.\n\nMYTH: The Affordable Care Act is “killing jobs” and undermining the private health care industry.\n\nFACT: Since the health care law was enacted in March 2010, 6.7 million private sector jobs have been created. Of the jobs created, 808,000 have been in the health care industry.\n\nAnd this week, Republicans will attempt to repeal the law for the 37th time.	10151612912774228
174979964227	I voted against CISPA in the House today because it does not adequately protect the civil liberties of Americans. People deserve both privacy and security.	10151565906694228

174979964227	The Clean Water Act turns 40 today! I'm proud to have defended this important law in Congress. In the 112th Congress alone, I voted 38 times against efforts to dismantle the Clean Water Act. Here's to clean water for years to come.	10151205119334228
174979964227	As part of Hispanic Heritage Month, it is fitting to recognize a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) serving members of the Latino community in California's 14th Congressional District. For over 160 years, Notre Dame de Namur University (NDNU) has helped thousands of students from around the world and here at home achieve higher learning. NDNU is one of only two private, nonprofit four-year institutions of higher learning in Northern California to be recognized by the federal government as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and the only one in San Mateo County.\n\nIn 2011, NDNU was awarded two HSI grants totaling $6 million from the Department of Education—one to help increase retention and success of Hispanic and low-income students, and one to increase the number of Hispanic and low-income students earning degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.\n\nPlease join me in sharing your recognition or stories about your experience with this first rate institution.	10151167416009228
174979964227	Join me in saluting local Latino community leader and East Palo Alto Mayor Laura Martinez this month for Hispanic Heritage Month. Mayor Martinez was elected in 2008. She is a 27-year resident of East Palo Alto and has over 10 years of experience working with the community’s youth and families. She was selected by the Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal as one of the top 100 Women of Influence for 2012. She is the youngest council member to be elected to the East Palo Alto City Council and is one of the youngest mayors in the country. Bravo, Laura!	10151163497674228

174979964227	On the State of the Union speech last night: I think it was quite a night, and an exceptional speech. The President presented a challenge to the Congress.  He said to the legislative bodies, "Send these bills to me and I'll sign them." But, he let Congress off the hook by not calling them a "do-nothing Congress."  I was also disappointed that President Obama did not address the tsunami of money that's washing through the political system after Citizens United.\n\nThe theme of building an America to last is highly appropriate, a confidence-builder for the country, and he pointed out how to do it.  The President brought forward great examples from our society -- the team that went in to take down Bin Laden -- and how nothing could come between them, which is why they were successful.  He used that as a powerful analogy to the Congress and to the country.	10150551364679228
174979964227	UPDATE: I just voted for Senator Reid's compromise plan. It cuts $2.3 trillion in spending, protects Social Security and Medicare for the more than 80,000 seniors in my district, and raises the debt ceiling through March 2013. Default is not an option.	10150269614659228

174979964227	Medicare guarantees that the 78,803 seniors in my Congressional District will always have coverage for doctors, hospitals, treatments, surgeries and medicines they need. The new House Republican budget would privatize Medicare, beginning in 2022, eliminating that guarantee. I will do everything I can to fight and defeat this effort to privatize Medicare. http://goo.gl/fcJ7M	10150157117744228
221191600719	I am disappointed Speaker Boehner chose to irresponsibly interject politics into what has long been a strong and bipartisan relationship between the United States and Israel. As President Obama has noted, it is inappropriate for a Head of State to address Congress just two weeks ahead of their election. I agree that Congress should not be used as a prop in Israeli election campaigns, so I intend to watch the speech on TV in my office.	10155233117265720
221191600719	Like many of my colleagues in Congress, and many of my constituents, I am disappointed in the failure of accountability for the shooting of 18 year-old Michael Brown. My sympathies and thoughts go out to Michael Brown's family and the Ferguson, Mo. community.\n\nAs the family of Michael Brown has advocated, I urge those who are distraught and disillusioned by yesterday's events to channel their disappointment into peaceful demonstration, non-violence, and action to make to our justice system more equal to better reflect the values we hold dear.	10154834793870720
221191600719	I am deeply saddened by the news of Lee Sturtevant's passing.  Lee was, throughout her life, a tremendous force for good. She was someone who stood up for the underdog, who took action instead of being a critic from the sidelines.  She was my first campaign manager when I ran for the Santa Clara Board of Supervisors in 1980 and my first Chief of Staff.  She was a committed Democrat who believed that government had a role in advancing opportunities for those who had none. She made a difference in our world, and I will miss her greatly	10154417269070720

221191600719	So many families have been touched when a loved one has struggled through the ups and downs of their journey with Alzheimer's.  This week advocates from across the country, including Dagmar Schildwach from San Jose, and Karen Stevenson and Ruth Gray from East Bay, came to DC to share their personal stories and urge Congress to invest in smart funding for improved prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's.	10153973806910720
221191600719	Today I met with courageous women from across the country who have come to our nation's capital this week to fast for immigration reform.

I was honored that they gave me a red band of string to wear in solidarity in the fight to pass immigration reform.	10153970768135720
221191600719	I got to visit today with students, teachers & parent chaperones from Morgan Hill's Britton Middle School during their trip to our nation's capital this week.

221191600719	This week Vietnamese-Americans are gathering in our nation's capital to advocate for greater human rights in Vietnam.

51052893175	Yesterday the House passed H. Res. 233, stating #Iran should immediately release the three United States citizens that it holds. This is a travesty, and the Obama Administration should increase the pressure until these Americans are brought home safely. As long as Iran imprisons innocent Americans, it is hard to imagine conducting good-faith negotiations over Iran’s nuclear pursuits.	10152923612433176

51052893175	The current #drought in California is devastating. Today’s order from the governor should not only alarm Californians, but the entire nation should take notice that the most productive agriculture state in the country has entered uncharted territory. We have experienced extreme drought conditions in years past but thanks to the most sophisticated water system in the country that captured and stored water during the wet years for use during the dry years, our communities and farmers survived. Unfortunately, state officials have turned their back on this proven infrastructure system. \n                                                        \nToday’s order is the culmination of failed federal and state policies that have exacerbated the current drought into a man-made #water crisis. Sacramento and Washington have chosen to put the well-being of fish above the well-being of people by refusing to capture millions of acre-feet of water during wet years for use during dry years.\n \nThese policies imposed on us now, and during wet seasons of the past, are leaving our families, businesses, communities, and state high and dry. These rules and regulations must be changed.\n \nMy House colleagues and I have acted aggressively to enact legislation that would have helped protect us from the current situation. In 2011, and again in early 2014, the House passed comprehensive water legislation to increase the amount of water we could capture and store. Unfortunately, the Obama and Brown Administrations and Senators Boxer and Feinstein opposed these proposals. As the drought continued to worsen, the House passed emergency drought legislation in December of 2014 to allow us to capture storm and rainwater from early season storms. That too was blocked by the Senate.  \n \nI’m from the Central Valley and we know that we cannot conserve or ration our way out of this drought. It is time for action, and House Republicans are developing another legislative proposal to help put California water policy back on the path to commonsense. Given today’s announcement, this time I hope Governor Brown, Senator Boxer, and Senator Feinstein will join my colleagues and me in this effort.	10152761026103176

51052893175	Radical Islamist terrorists, such as the Islamic State (ISIL), pose a grave and growing threat to the United States. I have been supportive of efforts to give the Commander-in-Chief additional authorities to confront these growing challenges, but rather than expanding his legal authority to go after #ISIL, the President seems determined to ask Congress to further restrict the authority of the U.S. military to confront this threat. Speaker John Boehner and I told the President we’d consider his request. I am prepared to support an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that provides new legal authorities to go after ISIL and other terrorist groups. However, I will not support efforts that impose undue restrictions on the U.S. military and make it harder to win. Congress will be conducting hearings to review both the President’s strategy to combat radical Islamist terrorists and the legal authorities that might be required to implement an effective and sufficiently robust strategy. At the end of this process, I hope Congress and the Administration can be united on how best to respond to the increasingly complex and dangerous challenge we face.	10152656730263176
51052893175	I condemn today’s horrific terrorist attack in #Paris. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the French people. This terrorist attack, like so many before it, is an assault on fundamental democratic principles that are essential to a free society. 1.usa.gov/1Dyfa27	10152594129683176
51052893175	For years now, Governor Brown and the high-speed rail authority have turned the idea of high-speed rail into a public albatross far beyond what Californians envisioned or voted for.  The Governor’s push for this project will leave California with reduced government services and major disruptions to our communities. All of this and more harmful consequences for what some of the brightest minds in engineering call anything but ‘high-speed.\n\nThe project’s business plan is flawed at its core. As the price tag ballooned, private investment is still nowhere to be found. After the Obama Administration’s unaccountable spending in the early years of his presidency, the American people spoke loudly and ushered in a new Republican Congress to stop the waste. As a result, my colleagues and I decided that no federal money would be spent on such a wasteful project. With no private or federal money, the Governor and legislature want to support this boondoggle by raising the price Californians will pay at the pump under cap and trade. But even this still leaves the project grossly underfunded, which means more pain for no gain.\n\nSadly, today’s groundbreaking is a political maneuver. Supporters of the railroad in Sacramento can’t admit their project is deeply flawed, and they won’t give up on it despite the cost. But these political tricks are exactly what the American people are tired of and what the new Republican Congress is committed to ending.\n\nCongress will continue to ensure no more Federal taxpayer dollars are directed to this project.	10152593060178176

51052893175	Few emulate a commitment to others more than the men and women in uniform who are spending this holiday season away from their families in defense of our country. They may not be home for #Christmas, but their service gives the rest of America the opportunity to celebrate this season in peace and security. We should continue to keep these individuals and their families in our thoughts and prayers.	10152540614838176
51052893175	In two short days, radical Islamists have spread their terror first in the hostage crisis in #Australia and today in the senseless murder of children and staff members at a Pakistani school. These acts are horrendous and the mere magnitude of the killing in #Pakistan is unconscionable. The United States stands with the people of Pakistan in the face of this violent Islamic extremism. We remain steadfast in our desire for peace and in our opposition to these evildoers as we continue to fight against extremism and terrorism.	10152525708163176

51052893175	As we spend Thanksgiving with family and friends, we are reminded of the many blessings in our daily lives. We have the joy of family, & we have the privilege to live in freedom here in America. As we gather and celebrate, we must always remember and give thanks to the men and women of our military - many who live right here at home - who sacrifice so much so that we can celebrate these blessings. Each generation, our nation has been blessed with brave individuals who serve and sacrifice for all of us. Judy and I and our entire family wish everyone a Happy #Thanksgiving.	10152489177088176
51052893175	The President doesn’t seem to get the point that he must work with the government he has, not the government he wants. But despite Congress and the American people’s resistance to President Obama’s unilateral action—action the President himself said would ‘violate our laws’ and be ‘very difficult to defend legally’—the President has decided to go it alone yet again. As President Obama himself said, ‘there are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system.’ We urge the President to listen to his own words. America is a country of laws, and our Constitution does not grant the President the authority to legalize millions of immigrants with the stroke of a pen.\n\nNot only is this action wrong, it does absolutely nothing to solve the underlying problems of our open border and broken immigration system. In fact, it may exacerbate the problem.\n\nThe President’s action is a prime example of Washington cynicism. He has responded to Congress and the public’s desire for positive change with an all-or-nothing approach that only damages the prospect of future cooperation. He did not even attempt to start on the right foot and work with us in the new year.\n\nWhile House Republicans will still work to do everything we can to move the country forward, it is our obligation and responsibility to fight this brazen power grab that doesn’t solve the real problems.	10152477324523176

My thoughts and prayers are with the families of all of the victims and the people of #Israel. \n\nSuch an act of barbarism and terror is unconscionable. I condemn this attack and I call on the Palestinian Authority to take action to curb this violence, abandon its incitement against Israel, and seek a negotiated peace. Attacks like this can never be accepted and also set back the Palestinian cause.	10152472959863176

330504617051234	As we approach Memorial Day, Congress should be doing all it can to help unemployed veterans find work. Yet today, House Republicans voted against a motion to help unemployed veterans.  In 2014, there were 573,000 unemployed veterans, 55 percent of whom were age 45 and up.  Despite these unacceptable numbers, Speaker Boehner allowed the Veterans Retraining Assistance Program (VRAP) to expire last year, and continues to refuse to allow the House to vote on my bill to renew the program.  It is unbelievable to me that the Majority has turned its back on a program whose sole purpose is to help unemployed veterans find work. Every House Democrat voted to bring my bill to the floor.  While our motion to help unemployed veterans failed today, please be assured that I will continue to do all that I can to move this important legislation forward.	645903122178047
330504617051234	This week, I had the pleasure to host a Veterans Claims Expo in Camarillo.

It is my goal to ensure that all of our veterans throughout Ventura County are given the best access to the benefits that they have earned and rightly deserve. If you or someone you know needs assistance with the VA, please contact my office at (805) 379-1779.	642133692554990

While there has been progress in reducing wait times for our veterans, we still have a long way to go to ensure that all veterans receive the care that they have earned and deserve.	641849529250073
330504617051234	Almost 280,000 women have served the U.S. Armed Forces in post-911 Iraq and Afghanistan, and women now account for 20% of new military recruits.  With the number of women veterans growing, the VA must ensure that female veterans have equal access to VA healthcare and services as their male colleagues.  The VA has made great strides in its delivery of care to female veterans, but we need to ensure that all VA medical centers and local clinics have Designated Women’s Health Providers and gynecologists on staff to provide appropriate gender-specific care, and that referring veterans to non-VA care is a coordinated and seamless process.  Yesterday, I took part in a House Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing to discuss how the VA is addressing gaps in its women’s health program and breaking down barriers to care for female veterans.  According to the Disabled American Veterans, the lack of child care services is a serious barrier that prevents many female veterans from using VA healthcare. Last week, I introduced the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act, which would expand and make permanent the VA’s popular Child Care Pilot program so that primary caregivers -- women and men – have a safe and reliable place to leave their children while they visit VA medical centers and clinics.	640136902754669
330504617051234	Today the First Lady and Dr. Biden  visited New Orleans for the launch of the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness. In April 2014, the Ventura County Human Services Agency estimated that 11 percent of Ventura County’s homeless are veterans.  It is our moral obligation to ensure that each and every man and woman who served our country receives our support upon their return to civilian life, and that support starts with reauthorizing federal homeless veterans programs. For more information on veterans’ homelessness, go to http://www.va.gov/homeless/	636040136497679
330504617051234	On Tuesday, I convened a roundtable of Ventura County’s city managers to discuss local transportation and infrastructure needs. It is so important that we work together to ensure that federal policies work for our local communities. As a new member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am hopeful that Congress will pass a robust, long-term surface transportation authorization bill that will help with our local infrastructure needs.	620141888087504
330504617051234	Today, I joined with 211 of my colleagues to file an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of marriage equality. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act and reaffirmed our country's promise to the American people that all are equal under the law. As the Supreme Court considers these new cases, I am hopeful that it will continue to uphold equality for all Americans, which includes the right to marry the person you love.	617734624994897
330504617051234	Yesterday, I joined my colleagues in introducing the Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Safety Act of 2015 (H.R. 1291), which will help states and communities make safety upgrades at highway-rail grade crossings. Each year, nearly 270 people are killed at grade crossings, including the recent tragedies in Oxnard and in Valhalla, New York. Given the tremendous backlog of projects nationwide – including crossing safety improvements at Rice Avenue in Oxnard – Congress must increase funding for highway-rail crossing safety programs. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this important safety legislation.	617239065044453
330504617051234	While I was not pleased with the circumstances surrounding the planning of Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech, when the head of state of one of our closest allies speaks before Congress, regarding an issue of such importance, I believe it's critically important to listen. I know there were strong opinions surrounding this speech and greatly appreciate those who took the time to express their thoughts. It is with your input that I can better represent you in Congress.	616480825120277
330504617051234	It is absolutely irresponsible to threaten a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security. While I believe Speaker Boehner must allow the House to vote on the bipartisan, Senate-passed, full-year bill, I voted for the short-term bills because I could not in good conscience stand by while House Republicans play a dangerous political game with our national security.	615506881884338
330504617051234	Yesterday, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Ranking Member Peter DeFazio joined me on a tour of the Port of Hueneme to discuss the port's vital importance to Ventura County's economy. Afterwards, Ranking Member DeFazio and I hosted a roundtable discussion with port commissioners, local elected officials, and community stakeholders at which we discussed our community's unique transportation infrastructure needs. I want to thank CEO and Port Director Kristin Decas, VCTC Executive Director Darren Kettle, and Ventura County Airports Director Todd McNamee for their presentation's at today's event. I am also grateful for the many elected officials and community stakeholders who came together, and I look forward to continuing our work together to improve Ventura County's transportation future.	614002798701413

330504617051234	Proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Healthy Families Act, which would allow millions of workers to earn paid sick leave that they can use to take care of themselves or sick family members. Working families shouldn’t have to choose between being able to pay the bills and going to the doctor or taking care of a sick child or elderly family member.	607556186012741
330504617051234	On Friday, I had the privilege of speaking at the Jewish Federation of Ventura County’s “Women of Valor” luncheon in Camarillo along with Israel’s former Madame Ambassador Sally Oren. Congratulations to the 2015 “Women of Valor” honorees Ruthann Feingold of Ventura and Sheila Cohn of Ojai. The level of your outstanding dedication and service to the community is invaluable.	600774133357613
330504617051234	Five years ago, the Supreme Court issued its misguided Citizens United decision. I believe that Congress must pass legislation to combat the corrupting influence of wealthy special interests in politics. That is why I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Government By the People Act (H.R. 20), which will help return the balance of power in our government back to the American people.	599120920189601
330504617051234	Today is the 3rd anniversary of President Obama signing the VOW to Hire Heroes Act into law. This important law provides veterans with critical job training resources, as well as providing businesses with tax credits for hiring unemployed veterans. It is in this spirit that I urge Speaker Boehner to bring my bill, the VOW to Hire Heroes Extension Act (H.R. 3395), up for vote on the House floor to extend these important programs through December 2016. Just as the military leaves no one behind on the battlefield, we must leave no veteran behind when they come home.	571507152950978
330504617051234	As we mark the beginning of American Education Week, I want to recognize and thank the hardworking teachers in Ventura County who help educate our students and our community. Be assured that as your Congresswoman, I will continue to advocate for our students, teachers, and school support staff, and to work to ensure that every child has access to a high-quality, affordable education.	569948836440143
330504617051234	November is Military Family Month, when we thank the families of the brave men and women who serve in our Armed Forces for their sacrifice and service to our nation. As your Congresswoman and as a proud member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I will continue to fight to ensure that our brave servicemembers and veterans receive the benefits they have earned and deserve.	562185107216516
330504617051234	Today is the 36th anniversary of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which amended the 1964 Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of pregnancy. It is in this spirit that Congress must raise the minimum wage and ensure equal pay for equal work. It has been proven that when women succeed, America succeeds. And at home, when women succeed, Ventura County succeeds.	561783957256631
330504617051234	Since coming to Congress, I have worked tirelessly to advocate for the funding necessary to dredge Channel Islands Harbor, which provides desperately needed sand to Hueneme Beach. This was a team effort, as Supervisor Kathy Long, Supervisor John Zaragoza, Channel Islands Harbor Director Lyn Krieger, and local elected officials from the City of Port Hueneme advocated tirelessly to make this dredge possible. While we can and should celebrate this victory for our community, we must also remain vigilant to ensure future dredging occurs on-time and is sufficient to keep Channel Island Harbor navigable and provide adequate sand for our beaches.	555895151178845
330504617051234	Today, like every day, we take a moment to thank and recognize all the Gold Star Mothers and their children who have given immensely to our nation and sacrificed so much.	547889408646086

330504617051234	Three years ago today, the military’s misguided ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy came to an end, allowing all military members to serve openly in our armed forces regardless of who they love. As a member of the House Veterans’ Affairs committee and as your Congresswoman, I will continue to advocate for the rights of all servicemembers and their families. As a nation, we must ensure that all servicemembers receive the respect and benefits they have earned and deserve.	544392138995813
330504617051234	Congratulations to Ventura County Medical Center, which U.S. News & World Report ranked the best family doctor-training program in the country! I am a strong supporter of federal funding for the Graduate Medical Education program, which helps train the next generation of doctors across the country, including the best and brightest at Ventura County Medical Center. By investing in medical education now, we can prevent physician shortages in the future.	542735995828094

485493954794945	A few days ago I had the great opportunity of performing on the stage of DC's Shakespeare Theatre Company along with some of my Congressional colleagues and... Samira Wiley from Orange Is the New Black! As a fan of the show, I have to confess I was a little starstruck, but I had a great time acting with the 2015 cast of Will on the Hill.\n\nAs a member of The Congressional Arts Caucus, I am happy I had the amazing chance to highlight how important the arts are for America, for our economy, our education and our future as the world leader in innovation.	1035968126414189

485493954794945	Yesterday, I was honored to be the commencement speaker at the 40th annual Los Angeles Mission College Commencement. Hundreds of students graduate from LAMC in Sylmar every year, and I was happy to talk to them about the importance of continued learning, practicing their trade and, most importantly, being humble in a world that can be unforgiving. \n\nThank you to Dean Ludi Villegas-Vidal, President Monte Perez, LACCD Board of Trustees Member Mona Field and LACCD Chancellor Dr. Francisco Rodriguez for being there with me, congratulating these amazing young men and women for their hard work and accomplishment!	1030504970293838

485493954794945	Earlier this year, I had the honor of nominating Leticia Perez to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. Leticia attends Van Nuys High School and is part of the JROTC program there.\n\nIn May, Leticia and her parents came to my office in Panorama City where I was able to sit down and talk to this incredibly bright young woman, who will represent our Valley at the oldest military academy in our nation. \n\nOur armed forces are full of the men and women who represent the best of our nation. I look forward to seeing Leticia graduate as a 2nd Lt. in the United States Army in a few years, and becoming one of the great leaders in our nation. \n\nCongratulations Leticia!\n\nIf you know a high school student who would be interested in attending West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, the Merchant Marine Academy or the Coast Guard Academy, visit my website: https://cardenas.house.gov/services/military-academy-nominations	1028112660533069
485493954794945	I am incredibly disappointed in the Fifth Circuit Court today. Activist judges have decided to block President Obama's lawful action to protect families who are working hard to build our economy. I am hopeful for those families, and confident that the courts, including the Supreme Court if needed, will make the right decision to move us toward fixing an immigration system that everyone agrees is broken.\n\nOf course, Comprehensive Immigration Reform is the real repair that our broken system needs. We could grow millions of jobs and billions of dollars of economic growth, simply by being responsible legislators. Reform must happen for our nation to move forward. Until then, I look forward to President Obama's actions being upheld by the courts.	1021717977839204
485493954794945	Congratulations to the Drum Corps of Madison Middle School in North Hollywood, who swept the California State Drum Line Championships this past weekend in Fountain Valley! \n\nThe 21-member Drum Corps' achievement is all the more remarkable because they won every single category in which they were eligible to participate making them undisputed California champions. \n\nThis is the first State Championship the school has won in recent memory!	1014914621852873

From Thursday, a meeting with GRAMMYs on the Hill producers, singers, music engineers to talk about the need to protect creative rights, especially in Los Angeles. Also from Thursday, a meeting with Caregivers Action Network.	1000673826610286
485493954794945	70 years ago next month, the guns fell silent in Europe, and the rest of the world began to understand the full breadth and depth of the horror perpetrated by the Nazis, across that continent. Today, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember the eleven million killed by Hitler and his followers, including six million Jews. What was once a great and diverse group of voices ringing throughout dozens of countries was nearly stilled by this staggering and incomprehensible evil. \n\nWe must never forget, and we must recommit ourselves to never allowing such an abomination to happen again.	998430776834591

485493954794945	This International Women's Day, I am reminded of the words of Maya Angelou, a brilliant woman and a brilliant person. She said, "I believe that the most important single thing, beyond discipline and creativity is daring to dare." The theme of this important day, in which we acknowledge, empower and admire the women of the world, is #MakeItHappen, and Maya Angelou's urge that we dare embodies that theme.\n\nI have been lucky in my life and career to be surrounded by smart and passionate women with full hearts and ambitious minds who have mentored me about courage and daring to stand up for yourself and what you believe in: my mother, my wonderful wife, my brilliant daughters, my teachers, my friends.\n\nToday I pledge to keep working so that no young girl ever feels she needs to take a back seat and not have an equal opportunity to succeed. We should dare to get more girls into STEM and computer science careers so that the classrooms and boardrooms of the future are not the male-driven classrooms I sat in as an engineering student. We need to sign more women up for affordable care and make affordable child care a reality so that no mother will be forced to sacrifice her career for the health of her family. We need to dare to change the status quo that pays women less than men for the same work. We need to take action now and level the field.\n\nHappy International Women's Day to all the men and women in the world.	975490705795265

He was a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News and he will be missed, both as a voice in the Valley and as what all reporters hope to one day be, a difference maker. Rick was an old-school reporter who knew that facts were what made the argument but people were what made the story. He managed to work both into almost everything he wrote, seamlessly. I will miss Rick's quality and class, both as a reporter and as a fellow human being. Rest in Peace Rick Orlov, and thank you for all you did.	956342477710088

163108420409412	Tonight President Obama reminded us we are on the right track, but there is still work to do. He made his strongest case yet to strengthen the middle class through job creation and a fairer tax policy, so hardworking families can remain in their homes and see their paychecks go farther. 2015 offers a fresh start and opportunity to concentrate on what is good for the country. By putting politics aside and investing in our future together to create good-paying jobs, America can once again lead in the world economy.\n\nOur job in Congress is first and foremost to represent the people. In the San Gabriel Valley, I remain focused on our region’s most anticipated challenges and those we may not see coming. From increasing outreach to veterans and their families to preparing for future drought cycles and rebuilding our infrastructure, we must continue to work with local elected officials and businesses to meet the needs of our communities. #SOTU	807413312645583
163108420409412	Today I reintroduced legislation to meet the water needs of our San Gabriel Valley agencies, residents, and businesses.

163108420409412	It was a privilege to tour the AES Wind Energy Generation Facility in Palm Springs and join US Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell to promote the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) today.

Innovators and mental health professionals from 16 countries gathered to promote awareness of critical advances in technology – such as therapy using virtual reality technology, that will increase access to mental health care for all citizens.

163108420409412	Today I toured Los Angeles Freightliner to discuss local economic and trucking issues. LA Freightliner sells environmentally friendly trucks to independent companies in Southern California. I also met with Covina Mayor Walter Allen III and City Manager Daryl Parrish to discuss possible funding for public safety and storm water cleanup. Especially in this time of drought, it is critical that we protect our water supply from contamination to ensure access to clean water throughout the San Gabriel Valley.	627774743942775

90311772229	It’s great to have VA Secretary McDonald in Los Angeles.  I thank each and every one of the folks from the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) for what they do with the resources they have. There are a lot of families who but for the grace of the work HACLA does would find themselves homeless.  It’s a simple idea. Bring VA and HACLA staff together in one location to cut through the bureaucracy and get it done for Americans who got it done for us.	10153246389012230
90311772229	This week I met with Fred Walti from the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, which was awarded the 2014 Startup of the Year by the LA Sustainability Collaborative. He is a leading visionary in providing financial assistance and mentorship for #cleantech innovation that our district, state and country need. I also met the great #Baseball Hall of Famer Lou “the Franchise” Brock, a base stealer I wished the Dodgers had, to discuss the importance of #diabetes research and ways we can help prevent the disease that affects too many Americans.	10153203081452230
90311772229	A minimum wage is not the same as a living wage. All people who work for a living deserve to make enough to afford basic needs. I believe that parents who work hard for a living should make enough money to feed their kids. It's time for America to reward hard work It's time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. #FightFor15	10153198006727230
90311772229	I met with a group of senior veterans who live in the Beswick Apartments in Boyle Heights. I also sat down with non-profit housing developers who build affordable housing, like the Beswick Apartments, in neighborhoods that need it most. Thanks to these organizations, our veteran warriors and many working families in Los Angeles have access to quality affordable housing.	10153163798122230

90311772229	I’m excited to participate in the groundbreaking on a new 6th street bridge which will make LA’s landscape shine even brighter. I’m proud that this project, funded in part by federal tax dollars, will benefit local workers especially our veterans here in Los Angeles.	10153067401922230

282772691776629	Labor Day is an opportunity to highlight workers’ contributions to our country.  In the last decade, working Americans have seen income inequality and millions of American workers right now are unemployed or underemployment.  Most Americans want a good paying job.  That is why I am in support of raising the federal minimum wage, extending unemployment benefits, and ending the wage gap between women and men.\n\nOn this Labor Day, let us recommit ourselves to the values of working Americans and join together with a common purpose, so that everyone who works hard has a fair chance of moving ahead and living the American Dream. -Gloria	721240294596531

282772691776629	Today, our nation celebrates 238 years of independence.  During this celebration it is important to reflect how far we have come as a country. We must remember the service members, past and present, who have served to ensure our American freedom.  I hope everyone has the opportunity to enjoy this time with their friends and family and has a safe holiday weekend.  Happy Fourth of July! -Gloria	695002207220340

282772691776629	President Abraham Lincoln in his famous Gettysburg address promised a new birth of freedom in our nation.  Today we commemorate the day in which all people in America were made free: June 19, 1865. Known as Juneteenth, this is the day when Union Major General Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas and issued the President's executive order, known to us as the Emancipation Proclamation. Juneteenth has evolved into a national day of reflection and celebration for millions of Americans across the nation. -Gloria	687931631260731
282772691776629	I am pleased to announce that today Congress worked in a bipartisan manner on the passage of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA), which is the main authorizing vehicle for projects that are studied and constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The legislation will secure funding for vital large water projects, ensure efficiency and transparency, as well as promote job growth for local economies. I urge President Obama to sign this legislation. -Gloria	675026012551293
282772691776629	Cesar E. Chavez dedicated his life to the cause of fairness and equality. His admirable non-violent protests taught us that despite our differences, we must work together to pursue the American Dream of liberty and equality for all. As a leader, Chavez set an important example for this nation to respect worker rights and fair wages.\n\nToday, Cesar E. Chavez’s legacy is honored by Americans and millions of people around the world. We remember how far we have come and how much more work still remains to be accomplished.\n-Gloria Negrete McLeod	652336701486891

282772691776629	As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I fully supported those who serve and have served in our military. But today’s vote on S. 25, legislation aimed at restoring the cost of living adjustment for retired veterans by extending devastating Medicare sequester cuts to our seniors, is bad policy.\n\nI was elected to represent the best interests of all my constituents.  Pitting one group of Americans over another is not the way to govern.  Many of our nation’s retired servicemen and women would agree that cutting services from seniors and the disabled to pay for a benefit is just another example of bad policy put in place by Congress.  I voted "no" on the legislation and will stand by it.\n-Gloria Negrete McLeod	632404040146824
282772691776629	Tonight President Obama’s State of the Union Address laid out practical proposals to grow the economy, strengthen the middle class, and to empower all those hoping to join the middle class. I agree with the President that if someone works hard and plays by the rules, a person should have the opportunity to succeed in America. That is why America’s workers deserve economic security through common sense proposals that Congress can pass into law today.\n\nThe President reminded the nation that we can help job seekers find work and I have advocated for an extension of unemployment insurance benefits.  At a time when the economy is steadily recovering and millions of unemployed Americans are struggling to find work, not extending this vital lifeline to millions of American families hurts our economy.\n\nI agree with the President that the minimum wage should be raised and I am a co-sponsor of the Harkin-Miller bill.  California is one of the states that already has a higher minimum wage.  The benefits of providing higher wages will only make our nation’s economy stronger.\n\nI commend President Obama for addressing other issues such as the importance of making college more affordable, growing high-tech manufacturing, and improving on housing and retirement security; all topics important to California’s 35th Congressional District.\n-Gloria Negrete McLeod\n\n#SOTU #InlandEmpire	626400777413817
282772691776629	Today I cosponsored H.R. 3781, the “American Unemployed Worker Investment Act”.  This bill amends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) to provide small employers a two-year $4,000 per new employee credit against income tax for hiring individuals currently receiving unemployment compensation. By creating private sector incentives for hiring out-of-work Americans, this bill has the potential to reduce the amount we as a nation spend on unemployment benefits – all the while creating jobs and economic opportunities for out-of-work Americans.\n-Gloria Negrete McLeod	619442984776263
282772691776629	It has been a pleasure representing the Inland Empire communities of California’s 35th Congressional District this past year.  I wish you and your family a happy New Year and please enjoy the late-night festivities safely.\n-Gloria Negrete McLeod\n\n#InlandEmpire #CA35	613204732066755
282772691776629	I could not support the 2-year budget agreement because it does nothing to address the expiring emergency unemployment insurance that will impact over 836,000 unemployed Californians next year.  It is a temporary fix to what has been a prevalent problem here in Washington of not passing a permanent budget that actually addresses the long-term debt.\n\nNot extending funding to federal emergency unemployment assistance in this budget agreement could result in a slowing and weakening of our national economy at a time when the economy is showing signs of recovering and millions of unemployed Americans are still struggling to find work. \n\nThis budget agreement also does not eliminate the detrimental Sequester cuts to federal assistance programs that low income seniors, veterans and children rely on.  Therefore, I could not support this budget.\n-Gloria Negrete McLeod	602048153182413
282772691776629	Glad to hear that the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has recommended a $10,000 grant to support the Inland Pacific Ballet's "Young Persons' Guide to the Ballet" educational outreach program in the City of Montclair. #Arts #InlandEmpire #CA35\n-Gloria Negrete McLeod	601194266601135

They protect the freedoms that we all enjoy in this nation and allow us to celebrate the holidays safely at home.\n\nI also want to take a moment and thank you for participating in our democracy.\n\nFor this Thanksgiving, may you all enjoy it with your family and friends as I will with mine.\n\nAnd for those who will be celebrating the festival of lights: Happy Hanukkah!\n-Gloria	595164207204141

282772691776629	Tonight the House passed a bi-partisan agreement to end the government shutdown and avert a fiscal calamity that would have imperiled our economic recovery.  \n \nMoving forward, politics must be put aside.  We must work together to do what is best for the American people.  We must restore the confidence of America in our government by never allowing Congress to travel this path again.  I look forward to return home and continue to work for the constituents of the 35th District. \n-Gloria	575068362547059
282772691776629	Last night, the Federal Government was shut down!\n\nThe shutdown was a result of ideological demands to defund and delay the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  While I understand there are political differences regarding the Affordable Care Act, however, the nation should not suffer as a faction of Congress hold the government hostage as a means to defund a law the Supreme Court declared constitutional.\n\nAs a freshman member of Congress, this past November I was elected by the people of California’s 35th Congressional District to serve my community in Washington and not play political games.  Therefore, I ask my fellow Republican members in Congress to heed the voices of the American people and end this stalemate of a government shutdown that hurts our economy and our nation’s future.\n-Gloria	567084310012131
282772691776629	Today we commemorate the loss of the many lives on September 11, 2001 as a result of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.  Despite the tragedy of that day, America is as resilient as ever.  We remain resolute in our belief in the virtues of freedom and democracy and proudly stand united in defense of these virtues.  On this solemn occasion, I join all Americans in mourning those who perished on that day and honor their memory.\n-Gloria	558612917525937

282772691776629	Today I join fellow Members of Congress in condemning President Assad’s willful disregard for human rights through the use of chemical weapons.

I look forward to the debate.\n-Gloria	554545117932717

190867440939405	The senseless murders of Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, two NYPD Officers, were reprehensible and an absolutely tragedy. My heart goes out to their families, who are now forced to spend this Christmas without their father, husband, brother, and son. No one—regardless of race, creed, or uniform—deserves to lose their lives or their loved ones to such a cruel and heartless act.  \n\nI also hope for the recovery of Shaneka Thompson, the shooter’s ex-girlfriend and another victim of his senseless violence. She is in critical condition after being shot just hours before the two police officers. \n\nAccording to the assailant’s mother, the shooter was an unstable man with a long, troubling history with crime and violent mental illness. He stands apart from the hundreds of thousands of people of all backgrounds who have peacefully poured into streets across the nation to seek positive change in their communities. \n\nThis horrific act should not be used to further divide our country at a time when we should be coming together to heal and address rightful concerns around community policing and racial profiling.	1034388646587276
190867440939405	I just returned from a Congressional delegation trip to Cuba yesterday where my colleagues and I learned about a medication that has been shown to decrease amputations due to diabetes by 70%. One of the great things about today’s announcement about Cuba is that medications like this one can be clinically tested and marketed to help reduce more than 50,000 amputations per year here in the US. Diabetes disproportionately impacts low-income communities of color and is one of the greatest health disparities in our nation. If re-establishing relations with Cuba can help people here in the US and potentially prevent thousands of amputations a year, Congress should do everything in our power to assist the President in this effort.	1030437540315720

190867440939405	Today, I moderated a panel at the YWCA Greater Los Angeles’s Domestic Sex Trafficking Symposium called “The Challenges We Face in Combating Domestic Sex Trafficking of Children in California.” Child trafficking occurs far too often in our state, and there is a shocking lack of resources available to young victims of trafficking. \n\nI am very glad to have the panelists representing the domestic minor sex trafficking program of the Los Angeles County Department of Probation, the National Center for Youth Law, the Compton Juvenile Court, & MISSSEY as partners in the fight to stop trafficking and provide comprehensive support to trafficking victims in our community.	866820863344056
190867440939405	Together, we mourn the tragedy that took the lives of Los Angeles students way too early. It is a loss for our community. My thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by the tragic loss of life in the highway bus crash yesterday.	857537654272377
190867440939405	Yesterday I spoke with the California Commission on Aging about Congressional actions that will impact California’s older adults.  I assured them that I will fight harder than ever to protect and preserve Medicare.  And of course I will resist all attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which so far has saved elderly Americans over $9 billion in lower prescription drug costs.	842472975778845

190867440939405	Congratulations to Steve McQueen, Lupita Nyong'o, and the entire team who worked to make "12 Years a Slave" this year's Oscar Winner for Best Picture.

190867440939405	Yesterday, I spoke with 70 high school seniors at the STEM Academy of Hollywood. I was both impressed by their collective desire to pursue careers in medicine and technology and moved by their resolve to follow their dreams and help their community	825890040770472

190867440939405	I voted against unnecessary and expansive drilling legislation today, and I remain committed to making sure that decisions about energy production will not be at the sacrifice of our public health or the environment.

190867440939405	On Friday, I was saddened and horrified by news of the shooting at LAX. I am in airports twice a week and now, we are learning that the deranged young man was specifically targeting TSA agents to kill. The thought of TSA officers being targeted like this is truly tragic because TSA officers put their lives on the line for us everyday. \n\nMy heart goes out to the family of Gerardo Hernandez and all TSA officers who I know are grieving his loss. I depend on TSA officers and I have always appreciated their help as I commute from LA to DC every week to serve in the US House of Representatives.	752351198124357

110685735673141	As a mother and legislator, I want a secure future for my son and constituents. \n\nSo this morning I testified before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to speak about the health risks associated with climate change and how they disproportionately affect the Latino community.\n\nDid you know that 31% of Latinos live within 30 miles of a power plant? Or that Latinos are 165% more likely to live in counties with unhealthy levels of particulate matter pollution? \n\nThat is why we need to support the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which would help reduce the carbon pollution that causes so many health problems in our communities.	686066794801696

174519582574426	One of the highlights of my day was meeting with the Montgomery and Prattville Girl Scout Troops and their families visiting D.C. I always love engaging with my young constituents and hearing what questions they have. Today we talked about a wide range of topics, from the latest in Congress to the latest with Taylor Swift!\n \nIt was a blustery day on Capitol Hill, but these girls didn’t mind a little rain! Thanks again for letting me spend some time with you.	1115808345112207
174519582574426	What an honor to have Montgomery’s “Ace” General Charles “Chick” Cleveland in my office this morning. He was kind enough to spend some time with me and my staff and to share with us stories about his service, including what it’s like to shoot down a MIG jet! Later today, Gen. Cleveland and his fellow “Fighter Aces” will be bestowed the Congressional Gold Medal for their extraordinary acts of bravery on behalf of our country. The ceremony starts at 2:00 p.m. Central Time, and I encourage you to watch. \n\nAmerica’s “Fighter Aces,” are the country’s most distinguished fighter pilots, having earned the title, “Ace,” by downing at least five enemy aircraft in combat. Gen. Cleveland earned his “Ace” status as a pilot in the Korean War, in which he shot down five enemy aircraft in the dangerous region known as “MIG Alley.”  \n \nAfter Korea, Gen. Cleveland went on to a distinguished and decorated career as an aviator and combat instructor, finally serving as commander of Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base from 1980-1984. Retiring to Montgomery, Gen. Cleveland has remained active in Air Force affairs, both nationally and locally at Maxwell. \n \nNow 87, Gen. Cleveland serves as president of the American Fighter Aces Association and has worked to gather all the living Aces for today’s Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony. In all, 35 of the 77 living aces still living are expected to attend Wednesday’s ceremony.\n\nhttp://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2015/05/19/montgomerys-fighter-ace-honored-congressional-gold-medal/27623915/	1108029135890128
174519582574426	Students from Prattville Intermediate School are visiting Washington this week, and I enjoyed spending time them this afternoon at the Capitol. My friend Representative John Lewis, who is originally from Alabama, was nice enough to stop by to visit with students and answer some questions as well. What a great group of kids! Thank you to the teachers, parents and students for taking time out of your trip to meet with me!	1104559166237125
174519582574426	I’ve heard from many throughout Alabama who are concerned about federal regulators' proposed rule to redefine “waters of the United States.” This aggressive rule would vastly expand agencies' power to regulate small streams, ditches and ponds – even on private lands. This would particularly affect farmers and foresters.  \n \nSo tomorrow the House of Representatives has an opportunity to block this irrational rule as we consider H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015. This bill will force the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw the proposal and draft  a more sensible solution.\n \nEveryone agrees there should be reasonable rules to ensure our waters are safe and clean. But water regulations should make sense, and this kind of unnecessary, unilateral regulation from the federal government could result in farmers, foresters and other landowners facing sudden and drastic increases in compliance costs. I appreciate everyone who has voiced their concerns on this issue. http://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/wotusepa_4.9.15.pdf	1103423449684030

174519582574426	Getting to test my skills on the virtual law enforcement training simulator at Wallace Community College in Dothan! Wallace's Dothan campus has an excellent Criminal Justice Program that trains the next generation of law enforcement officers. It is also the only college in the state equipped with a virtual training simulator like this one, which I have to say is pretty impressive.\n\nCareer and Technical Education is so important to making sure young people can access the skills and training necessary to land great jobs. Alabama can be proud of its strong network of career tech programs that connect Alabama students with the careers of tomorrow. That's why enhancing career tech continues to be a focus of mine in Congress.	1095854930440882
174519582574426	It was good to be back in Elmore County today for visits in Tallassee. I enjoyed my roundtable discussion with small business owners hosted by the National Federation of Independent Businesses at PrimeSouth Bank. We covered several issues like healthcare, tax reform and federal regulations, which affect our small businesses and employers on a daily basis. This afternoon I joined the Tallassee Rotary Club at their meeting at Cozumel to discuss the latest with the VA, my travels throughout the Middle East, and ongoing legislative issues in Washington. It's important for me to get around and hear from constituents, and I appreciate all who came out today!	1084257281600647
174519582574426	This morning I had the pleasure of meeting with Anthony Brock, Fred Brock, Bryan Kelly and Edward Welch who shared with me their vision for Valiant Cross Academy, a school that would focus on building up young men in Montgomery. Their mission is to teach young men to "Rise Above" through honor, discipline, integrity, excellence and love.  \n\nI'm impressed by their plans and appreciative of their commitment to producing leaders within Montgomery's next generation. Thanks again for coming by the office.	1083635691662806
174519582574426	I was so proud to be a part of the Dothan Education Foundation's luncheon honoring the remarkable success of Dothan City Schools. Let me tell you, the years of hard work that have gone into improving public schools in Dothan is paying dividends. Three city schools were recently recognized as "Blue Ribbon Schools," a coveted national distinction for excellence. Beverlye Magnet School, Heard Magnet School and Montana Street Magnet School are now listed among select schools across the nation to earn this special award.\n\nMany other local schools are also being recognized for improvement as well. The credit goes to the hardworking teachers, parents, administrators and community leaders who have worked as a team to build success. I particularly want to thank the Dothan Education Foundation for its commitment to supporting and honoring public schools. Congratulations again on these outstanding achievements, and thank you to each individual who works daily to make our schools the best they can be!	1083180231708352
174519582574426	#TBT to last May when I traveled to Afghanistan with a group of women colleagues to visit with our soldiers on Mother’s Day. I've been blessed to have the opportunity to go on this trip each of the last four years.\n\nThis week, I’m back in the Middle East on a defense-related Congressional Delegation, but our mission is a bit different. We've traveled to Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, meeting with elected officials, our ambassadors and military personnel along the way. Our purpose has been to evaluate the rising influence of ISIS and Iran and to examine the potential impacts on U.S. interests at home and abroad. It’s been a productive week, and I’m grateful for this unique opportunity. http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/04/as_iran_negotiations_continue.html	1079964322029943
174519582574426	Update: We traveled to Israel where we met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss Iran’s nuclear agenda and terrorism in the surrounding region. Our visit with the prime minister comes at a particularly critical time as negotiations continue with Iran and the threat of ISIS remains strong.\n \nWe had a long, productive talk about our shared concerns relating to Iran’s nuclear capability. We cannot allow Iran to build a nuclear weapon, as it would threaten both our allies in the Middle East and our own national security.\n\nEvery indication we have tells us that the deal being discussed is weak. It would be a mistake to enter into a deal that creates an eventual path toward a bomb. We need to negotiate from a position of strength, not out of desperation to reach a deal with Iranian leaders who have stated an intent to harm both America and Israel.\n \nOur delegation assured Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand with Israel and will continue to work with its leaders to promote peace in the region.	1079260655433643
174519582574426	I met with several water and conservation groups today to discuss legislation that impacts Alabamians on a daily basis. I appreciate all who stopped by including representatives from Alabama’s Water Environment Association, American Water Works Association, Alabama Association of Conservation Districts and Alabama Soil and Water Conservation Committee. These groups work hard to provide clean affordable water and preserve natural resources, which is crucial for the people and economy of our state. Thank you for all you do!	1070752569617785
174519582574426	I talked with students- big and small- at McKenzie School today about my job in Congress. Thank you Principal Mike Gunter and Amy Bryan, Butler County School Superintendent, for allowing me this opportunity and for all that you do each day. It’s never too early to engage with our kids about the legislative process, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to hear their thoughts today.	1066317050061337
174519582574426	The DHS Appropriations Bill the Senate sent over was unacceptable. Why? No prohibition of funds for executive amnesty. Just voted to send it back with instructions to convene a Conference. \n\nWhen the House and Senate pass different versions of a bill, the next step is a Conference Committee of Members from each chamber to work out the differences. Why would Senate Democrats resist basic Civics?	1057658084260567

174519582574426	Why should the EPA be allowed to impose rules based on *secret* science? The public deserves to see the data and studies that EPA regulations are based on, and that's why I today voted for the Secret Science Reform Act, H.R. 4012. \n \nA poll conducted by the Institute for Energy Research shows that 90 percent of Americans questioned agreed that “when the federal government makes decisions based on studies and data,” that information should be made public. The Secret Science Reform Act will do just that, requiring the release of any data used to write EPA regulations. In doing so, this piece of legislation will increase transparency and rigorous scientific study. \n \nIsn't it time the EPA shared its research with the people its regulations affect? I certainly think so.	993043977388645

174519582574426	For the second consecutive year, Alabama has been named the 4th best state for doing business according to site selection experts. We also placed first in the competitive labor costs category. \n \nThe report touches on our automotive industry for achieving milestones like the combined production of a record 915,000 vehicles at Mercedes-Benz in Vance, Honda in Lincoln and Hyundai right here in Montgomery. Even more important though are the jobs numbers. The state’s auto-supplier sector added 2,300 new jobs in the year ended June 30!\n \nThank you to the Alabama workers who make our continued success in the auto industry possible!	948698128489897
174519582574426	Getting word that the VA is adding primary care to services offered by Patient-Centered Community Care, or PC3. This is great news for veterans!\n\nAll year I've been telling anyone who would listen about the need to expand/enhance PC3 to meet the increased demand at VA medical centers and deal with the backlog. PC3 connects veterans to local, private hospitals/providers if they can't get a timely appointment at their local VA facility or if they live far away. The VA reform bill enacted last week includes strong provisions for PC3 and other "fee based" programs, which was among my top priorities going in. \n\nUntil now, PC3 had typically been limited to specialty care. But with so many veterans having to wait for basic primary care appointments, it only makes sense to utilize local clinics for that as well. \n\nWe know there is increased demand at the VA. So why not utilize our great local doctors, hospitals and clinics, especially when the alternative is putting a veteran on a waiting list?	930931210266589
174519582574426	Getting a tour of the amazing Children's of Alabama Hospital from Dr. Yung Lau, pediatric cardiologist. Thank you to Mike Warren, Suzanne Respess and Dr. Bob Pass for giving my valuable insight into the impressive work happening at this very special place.	930438803649163

19787529402	The House has acted for a 3rd time and passed another Continuing Resolution that would prevent a government shutdown. The Senate now has a choice--keep the government open or close it to protect Obamacare waivers for themselves and friends. #NoSpecialTreatment	10151729063609403

19787529402	Another disappointing jobs report this month. The American people continue to struggle--to find jobs, grow their businesses, put food on the table for their families. Small businesses are struggling to hire as Obamacare drives up costs and our nation's over $16 trillion debt continues to hurt economic growth. It's time for this Administration to realize their policies are hurting Americans and stifling our nation's economy.	10151680284444403

19787529402	It is not fair the President is choosing to protect big businesses from Obamacare, but not hardworking individuals and families. Today House Republicans will act to protect all Americans from the unworkable mandates of the President’s health care law by voting to delay both the individual and employer mandates.

19787529402	Here is wishing you and your loved ones a safe and festive Independence Day!\n\nOver two hundred and twenty five years ago, British citizens in the American colonies embarked on a course of action that culminated in the formation of the United States of America. In doing so, they established a set of principles and ideals for government that we continue to honor today.  They began a call that countless men and women across our nation have answered time and time again since then.\n\nGeorge Washington once said, ‘Every post is honorable in which a man can serve his country.’ \n\nFrom all walks of life, heroes have emerged in the service of our nation. On this 4th of July we celebrate the freedoms that these heroes – past, present and future – have so valiantly secured. We recognize their service and most importantly, we offer them our thanks.	10151553396199403
19787529402	Today marks the 69th anniversary of D-Day.

Their heroism and sacrifice will forever be remembered.	10151502651114403

6769692966	My statement on today's Supreme Court ruling on the Hobby Lobby case:  \n\nObamacare is bad health care policy, but it also runs roughshod over deeply-held religious and moral beliefs.  America is a nation that traces its beginnings to the principle of freedom of conscience. The government gets into very dangerous territory when it tries to compel individuals to act in ways that violate their religious freedom.  In the floor statement I gave when I voted against Obamacare, I stated my concern that the law could force people to fund abortions against their religious and moral convictions.  Today’s Supreme Court decision ought to cause the Obama Administration to reassess a long list of policies that many of us consider hostile to the full and free exercise of religious belief.	10152173466197967

7476269851	Anne and I wanted to share a special thank you for all the well wishes and congratulations we received this week. Your kind words and thoughtful messages truly made us feel like newlyweds. We couldn’t be more blessed!\n\nThanks again to Reverend Conroy for the beautiful ceremony and Speaker Boehner for standing with me on this special day.	10154033530689852
7476269851	Good news is always worth sharing, especially with the many Alaskans I consider to be my friends and family. Today, I’m happy to announce that my fiancée Anne and I have tied the knot. As I celebrate my 82nd birthday, Anne has given me the best gift anyone could ask for – her hand in marriage. She jokingly says I will never forget our anniversary.\n\nGod has blessed both Anne and me in so many ways; Anne with an amazing career as a flight nurse, a wonderful and caring husband, two remarkable children and six grandchildren. God gave me a loving wife of 46 years, two beautiful daughters and 14 grandchildren. We have both known great love and experienced deep heartbreak.  In many ways neither of us ever thought we would find love again, but sometimes life surprises you.\n\nAnne and I are truly fortunate to have found each other. We are excited to begin our lives together and to share in the many joys marriage brings. It’s an honor to share this special day with you and I look forward to Alaskans getting to know my lovely bride better.	10154024198389852
7476269851	In celebration of National Small Business Week, today I visited Alaska Glacier Seafoods in Juneau, AK. It's always good to see our Alaskan businesses hard at work!	10153907650374852
7476269851	I always enjoy seeing the innovative programs developed in our state to complement the needs of our industries and workforce.

7476269851	Meanwhile, back in the office, Kristin Davis and I discussed the issues of wildlife conservation in Africa. Carrie, Samantha and Miranda couldn’t make it.	10153872416124852
7476269851	Truly honored to receive this flag of appreciation from the “Flying Dragons”, 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment at Ft. Wainwright. This flag was flown on multiple missions in Afghanistan as well as above their HQ’s. God bless and thank you for your service and sacrifice to our nation!	10153836423634852
7476269851	Great day in the Golden Heart City. Safe trails and happy mushing! #TheLastGreatRace	10153741822504852
7476269851	Members of the Northwest Arctic Leadership Team (NWALT) stopped by to discuss a number of important regional priorities, including oil and gas development, Arctic policy issues, education and economic opportunities.	10153721660934852
7476269851	Congratulations to the Alaska Military Youth Academy’s graduating class of 2015. Through hard work, determination, and a high level of discipline these cadets have all been able to accomplish something great! I look forward to working with these young Alaskans in the future.	10153713483559852
7476269851	The Army listening session in Fairbanks is underway with a tremendous showing of support. I'll be calling in shortly to share my thoughts with the "Golden Heart City". Tune in live @ http://vcap2.gcimbs.net/tcs/#page:recordingList&pageNumber:1&category:8008E394-F922-4C9E-92A5-9A131FCE3857	10153705854114852

7476269851	An unprecedented assault on Alaska by President Obama and Interior Secretary Sally Jewell has just begun. Starting today, they will announce plans to lock away ANWR's coastal plan for any future developments and even motorized access, in addition to other plans to block offshore developments in the Arctic. \n\nThis callously planned and politically motivated attack on Alaska by the Obama administration is akin to spitting in our faces and telling us it’s raining outside. Simply put, this wholesale land grab, this widespread attack on our people and our way of life, is disgusting.	10153615281774852
149561218527414	Proud to have joined the USO's Service Project on Capitol Hill today and assembled care packages for our deployed service members.  My sincerest thanks to all of our troops for their service.	496128683870664
200227780116038	Merry Christmas!	346313372174144
7476269851	Thank you for the many thoughts, prayers, and condolences you’ve shared as my family prepares to honor the life of my older brother, who unexpectedly passed away days ago. This week I lost a dear friend and teacher, and I truly appreciate the understanding and support Alaskans have shown me during my brief absence from Congress to tend to this important family matter. I look forward to returning to Washington, D.C. in the coming days to begin the 114th Congress and continue my work on behalf of the Alaskan people!	10153565947134852
7476269851	In the many conversations I’ve had with Alaska Native leaders and families since the reauthorization of VAWA last year, I heard a consistent, clear, and powerful message: Section 910 was an error and must be repealed. \n\nToday, after overcoming numerous procedural hurdles in the House to pass the legislation, the President has signed that repeal into law.	10153474225559852
7476269851	Happy Hanukkah to all those in Alaska celebrating the Festival of Lights!	10153469333999852
7476269851	Happy Thanksgiving! Like many Alaskans, the beginning of the holiday season is one of my favorite times of the year – a time to spend with friends and family, count our many blessings and reflect on the many joys in life. \n\nAs you celebrate this Thanksgiving, I encourage you to take a moment to reflect on the many things we have to be thankful for, including the love of family, good health, our Alaskan spirit and determination, and the remarkable men and women in uniform who serve to protect our freedoms.\n\nGod bless.	10153419326294852
7476269851	I’ve been traveling across the state this week to hear your thoughts and concerns. Thanks for the hospitality and continued support Alaska.	10153261798889852
7476269851	Following the President's address to the nation, I shared these thoughts with Alaskans:\n\nThe reality of this situation cannot be understated. ISIL is a grave regional threat and rapidly emerging as a global security risk.  In order to counter this radical extremist group and others like them, I continue to believe in the use of targeted airstrikes by the United States. Not only have these methods proven effective in helping those on the ground defend themselves, they have also begun to curb advancements of our global enemies. I also believe that now is the time for nearby regional powers – Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt – to step up to the plate, commit resources, and begin fighting back against a threat that is quite literally in their backyard.\n \nAs Americans, we cannot turn a blind eye to what is happening.  The actions of the terror group ISIL – rape, beheadings, mass executions, and crucifixions – and its sadistic attempts to propagandize these actions demonstrates a complete disregard of basic human rights and a fundamental detachment from what it means to be a human-being.  Short of putting American boots on the ground, the United States should continue to use its superior firepower to confront and defeat this group of extremists.\n \nMy colleagues and I will continue to discuss the very serious matters surrounding this terror organization.  Through on-going hearings and briefings by House national security committees, I am confident that we can find the appropriate steps to defeat our enemies.	10153210246814852
7476269851	Thank you to the Alaska Miners Association for hosting the Women in Mining Congressional Roundtable in Fairbanks to discuss the many issues affecting our industry. \n\nThese types of conversations are always helpful in addressing the rapid growth of our federal government and policies that stand in the way of responsible resource development. I look forward to continuing this conversation in the future with our #womeninmining.	10153112667139852
7476269851	Today’s passage of H.R. 3110, the Huna Tlingit Traditional Gull Egg Act, in the United States Senate represents years of perseverance and dedication by the Huna Tlingit people, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and myself to once again allow members of the Hoonah Indian Association to resume the harvest of seagull eggs in the Glacier Bay National Park. \n\nAs the Chairman of Subcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs, I introduced and passed this bill in the House in order to protect the traditional way of life for Alaska’s First People. For the Huna Tlingit people, this traditional gull egg harvest is a significant part of their culture that took place well before the establishment of the Glacier Bay National Park and it’s a shame that it took this long to allow the practice to resume. I look forward to seeing this legislation signed into law by the President in the soon future.	10153041998944852
7476269851	Earlier this month, the residents of King Cove, Alaska tribes and two local governments sued Secretary Sally Jewell, the head of the Interior Department, for her refusal to grant access to an 11-mile, emergency access road from King Cove to Cold Bay. Today, I am proud to hear Governor Sean Parnell and the State of Alaska have joined the lawsuit against Secretary Jewell to once and for all protect the lives of Alaskans by making this life saving road a reality.	10153017709504852
7476269851	I applaud the landmark ruling today by the Supreme Court that struck down provisions within the President's healthcare law that unconstitutionally violated the religious freedom of our nation's employers.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 5-4 decision today in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby now gives employers with religious objections to federally mandated contraceptive coverage the right to opt out.\n\nI wholeheartedly believe that our religious freedoms should never be bent or broken by any form of government, let alone an ill-conceived partisan package like Obamacare.  Our religious freedom must be cherished by all as a defining characteristic of what makes this nation great.	10153017100889852
7476269851	Last night, I joined the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS) to celebrate their 25th Anniversary and accept an award to commemorate my ongoing advocacy work as Co-Chair of the Congressional Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Caucus. Alaska Native women are 10 times more likely to deliver a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, which is one of the reasons why NOFAS and the Congressional FAS Caucus continue our work to ensure all newborn babies are given a bright future by raising awareness and promoting healthy lifestyle choices.	10153003874219852
7476269851	Happy Father's Day Alaska.	10152975854034852

244907165625305	I want to thank Secretary Chuck Hagel for his service as Secretary of Defense and as an Army sergeant, Vietnam War veteran and recipient of the Purple Heart. I have appreciated the opportunity to work with the Secretary as a member of the House Armed Services Committee and on behalf of Southern Arizona’s service members and military installations. I wish him and his family all the best in the future.	690204231095594
244907165625305	Our immigration system is broken and it's Congress's job to fix it. \nI've said from day one that Congress needs to act, and the President should not go it alone. I am disappointed that Congress has brought us to this point and I call on leaders in the House to end the gridlock and bring the bipartisan McCain Flake Immigration bill to the floor. Arizona deserves a real solution that promotes our economy and ensures the safety of our citizens.	688323654616985
244907165625305	Sunday I spoke at an event for families in the Sahuarita-Green Valley area who care for a disabled relative. The event was the Sahuarita-Green Valley Support Network Disability Fair, an opportunity for individuals living with a disability and their families to talk with vendors who provide needed services.	685936344855716
244907165625305	Earlier this week, my staff attended a University of Arizona Veterans Day ceremony at the World War I Memorial Fountain.

A big salute to the people of Sierra Vista for this outpouring of appreciation for those who served and who continue to serve.	683844285064922
244907165625305	A very fitting way to observe Veterans Day in Tucson with the renaming of a park to honor Command Sgt. Maj. Martin “Gunny” Barreras. At this park, Sgt. Maj. Barreras ran and stayed fit as a varsity offensive lineman for the Sunnyside High School Blue Devils. Sgt. Maj. Barreras died in May a week after he was wounded in Afghanistan when enemy forces attacked his unit.\nhttp://tucson.com/news/local/tucson-park-renamed-for-fallen-soldier-gunny-barreras/article_063ead75-529e-5620-a0f7-d0d035f195da.html	682603808522303

244907165625305	I welcome the long overdue release of Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, who was held for 214 days in a Mexican jail. \n\nMexican authorities arrested him because he was carrying three guns when he drove into Mexico – weapons that he obtained legally in the United States. He violated Mexican law by entering that country with the guns, but there is abundant evidence that Sgt. Tahmooressi entered Mexico through an innocent mistake.\n\nWhile I am glad this painful episode is over, Sgt. Tahmooressi should never have been jailed by Mexican officials. We welcome him home and offer our continued support as he returns to his family.	676406405808710
244907165625305	Green Valley News & Sun Publisher Rebecca Bradner welcomed the crowd to celebrate the launch of their 50th Anniversary publication, Green Valley Through the Decades, a book highlighting the history and accomplishments of the residents of Green Valley.	675261669256517

244907165625305	The Sierra Vista City Council passed a resolution designating Sierra Vista a "Purple Heart City" last night. This is a tribute to the men and women who have received the Purple Heart medal, which is awarded to those wounded or killed in combat. The local chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart worked closely with the city in establishing this honor. My office attended this ceremony with leadership from U.S. Army Fort Huachuca and members of Military Order of the Purple Heart, Sierra Vista Chapter 572.	671331936316157

244907165625305	Spoke yesterday at the AZ Small Business Development Center Veterans Conference. Our veterans' training and experiences make them ideal business owners and employees. This conference highlighted resources for veterans interested in starting their own business.	667379376711413
244907165625305	The Department of Defense is considering reducing per diem allowances to civilian employees for long-term temporary duty by 25-45 percent.

244907165625305	Honor Flight Southern Arizona brought World War II veterans to see their memorial in Washington this weekend. Yesterday they returned to Tucson International Airport to cheering greeters. It was great to see these veterans get the recognition they deserve.	666327530149931
244907165625305	Update on the Mexican mine 30 miles upstream from the U.S.-Mexico border: The International Boundary and Water Commission reports that lab tests from the San Pedro River in Mexico are within a normal range. Mexican officials took water samples on Sept. 23 following reports of a release of potentially contaminated water into the San Pedro River watershed. The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality reported on Oct. 3 that laboratory results from sampling in the San Pedro River in the United States also were normal. I will continue to post updates on Facebook as information becomes available.	666326593483358
73539896233	I was honored to welcome a delegation of farm workers and migrant clinicians from across the country to Capitol Hill today to raise awareness about the threats of occupational exposure to pesticides. Our 23-year-old current standard is woefully outdated and ineffective at preventing pesticide poisoning for workers in fields, nurseries and greenhouses across the nation. We must strength these protections when they get updated this coming September!	10152983459306234
73539896233	The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) hurts working families. While Republicans think about their next steps to fast track bad trade deals, TPP won’t get any better. Fast tracking TPP means paying more for medicine, shipping jobs overseas and lower our standards for safe food. Thanks, but no thanks.	10152983170161234
73539896233	A little taste of home for me. I have my home and my neighbors in mind as I vote against the trade legislation in Congress today. I am opposed to shipping jobs overseas, and I’m opposed to plundering $700 million from Medicare to pay for the assistance our displaced workers will desperately need.	10152975452311234
73539896233	Thank you to everyone who helped make last weekend’s forums on the threats posed by the Trans-Pacific Partnership such a success! We had over 120 attendees in Phoenix, and another 175 people in Tucson come out to hear from leaders in labor, environmental, healthcare and corporate fields on why TPP is a bad deal for American workers and our environment.	10152968081181234
73539896233	Great showing tonight in Phoenix! Stopping the TPP isn't just some effort to stop a trade deal. This is about protecting our workers from having their jobs outsourced. It's about safeguarding our environment in the face of subpar regulations abroad. Simply put, it's about protecting the integrity of the American way of life.	10152963116241234
73539896233	Visiting Cuba in person was an opportunity to see first-hand the many ways our nations can mutually benefit from open relations. We are the only nation in our hemisphere that doesn’t deal with Cuba, and that has to change if we want to develop a mutually prosperous relationship with this neighbor just 90 miles off our coastline. President Obama has taken significant actions to normalize relations with Cuba. Now Congress must act to fully end the decades-old trade and travel embargo.	10152955918336234
73539896233	The Alliance for Retired Americans is a leading voice in the fight to protect seniors all across America. From protecting Social Security and Medicare, to defeating attacks on the Affordable Care Act, to ensuring adequate support for housing and senior nutrition programs, the ARA is an incredible ally in the fight to protect seniors in this nation from the far too common attempts to cut their benefits and services. I am honored once again to receive a 100% score from them for my efforts to protect seniors and retired Americans, and look forward to continuing our strong alliance for years to come.\nhttp://grijalva.house.gov/news-and-press-releases/rep-grijalva-honored-by-100-percent-rating-from-alliance-for-retired-americans/	10152949882911234
73539896233	I welcome news that the Cherrybell Processing and Distribution Center will likely not shut down in July, as had previously been planned. Any news other than closure is good news, but we must keep in mind the hundreds of our neighbors who are waiting with baited breath to learn if their jobs will be there next year. I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure the outcome of this delay is the right one for our neighbors, our community, and out postal service at large.\nhttp://grijalva.house.gov/news-and-press-releases/rep-grijalva-on-cherrybelltucson-mail-center-closure-status-change/	10152932698301234

73539896233	As our nation commemorates National Peace Officers Memorial Day and National Police week, I want to share these tremendously moving pictures from events in our community with you. On May 1st, Pima County held its 8th Annual Regional Law Enforcement Memorial with every law enforcement agency in the region was present. My staff was honored to meet family members of those who laid down their lives in service, and moved by the beautiful ceremony in their honor. \n\nThe City of Yuma held its own ceremony today for Yuma-based members of the police force and Marines who gave their lives in service by naming several of the City’s avenues in their honor. I am grateful to know their names will forever be a part of the community they served and protected. \n\nThe men and women who keep us safe each and every day deserve our eternal gratitude, not just today or this week, but EVERY day. \n\nThank you to our local heroes for protecting us despite great personal risk. Thank you to their families for the sacrifices they make when a loved one dedicates his or her life to protecting others. We are grateful for all that you do. #HonorOurHeroes	10152905630131234

73539896233	President Obama did his part to right our broken immigration system in the face of Republican intransigence. Now the responsibility of proper implementation falls to DHS, and we need to know beyond the shadow of a doubt that harmful practices of the past aren’t continuing today under the guise of new directives. I urge Secretary Johnson to act quickly in providing the assurance to the American people that those who deserve protection from deportation are no longer living with a target on their backs.\nhttp://grijalva.house.gov/news-and-press-releases/rep-grijalva-calls-for-accountability-on-immigration-enforcement-priorities/	10152899812851234
73539896233	Not once, but twice this week, our state has risen above the voices of intolerance to recognize that DACA students are every bit as much a part of Arizona as anyone else. This is their home; they are our neighbors; and they deserve the same in-state tuition that every other one of our neighbors is welcome to. Read my full response to today's Board of Regents decision here: \nhttp://grijalva.house.gov/news-and-press-releases/grijalva-praises-board-of-regents-decision-allowing-instate-tuition-for-daca-students/	10152891923501234

104329699641957	Today is a very special day for my family as we celebrate my daughter's graduation from Creighton Law School. Unfortunately, this joyous occasion resulted in me missing today's votes in the House. However, I was intimately involved in the fight this week and we were successful in stripping an amnesty provision from the NDAA. \nAnd while today is a proud moment for me as a father, this past week has been very difficult for my family as we learned that my younger sister was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She is one of the strongest women I have in my life and I am optimistic that she will overcome this illness. Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers during this challenging time for our family.	856443441097242
104329699641957	While my own children may be all grown up, I still love to act like a kid from time to time when I get the chance to visit Arizona schools.

104329699641957	Unfortunately, I could not vote the past 2 days while attending to a family emergency in Arizona, but I still want to share for the record how I would have voted if I were present:\n\nYES - H.R. 3, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, a bill to authorize TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. to construct, connect, operate, and maintain the Keystone XL pipeline.  \n\nYES - H.R. 30, the Save American Workers Act of 2015, a bill to correct Obamacare's redefinition of "full-time employee" to one who works only 30 hours per week.

104329699641957	Free Media in Turkey Under Attack\n\nFor those of you watching developments in Turkey, I want to point out that yesterday's decision to start rounding up and arresting journalists is a troubling development.  Turkey is a key block between the Middle East, sharing a border with Iraq, Syria, Iran and others, and Europe.   It has a long history, since the 1920's, of a tolerant and westernized society that tolerated an open media, minority religions and respect for human rights.\n\nTurkey is too important in the region to turn into another closed society.	767659403308980
104329699641957	Today, my former Press Intern, Lilia Dashevsky, gave her senior speech at Phoenix Country Day. Lilia is an extremely accomplished young woman with a bright future ahead of her.

Essentially it will do three very simple things:\n\n1) Telemarketers must clearly state their name and the business they are calling on behalf of\n\n2) During the call they must provide their phone number, address, and website\n\n3) They must transmit caller ID information that displays their name and a phone number that can be called back to reach them.\n\nI’ll post a link in the coming days, but in the meantime I want your feedback and ideas as to how we can make this a better bill!	784609954921388
150338151681908	Looking forward to the game today! Spending it with family and couldn't be happier. Can you guess who we're rooting for? #SB49	779031388812578

209486545087	I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the State of Israel on its 67th Independence Day. Despite unrelenting war and terror being waged against it from the day of its birth, the innovative spirit of Israel's citizens has not faltered, and their democratic and moral values, rooted in the Jewish tradition, have only grown and become stronger. We reaffirm our unwavering friendship with Israel on this momentous day, based on our common democratic and Biblical values, and we wish the State of Israel to continue to prosper and overcome all the challenges that come its way.	10155508354190088
209486545087	It was an honor to be with EMET - Endowment for Middle East Truth yesterday in New York City.	10155502924740088
150338151681908	Earlier this year, I introduced the Secret Science Reform Act, H.R. 4012. The bill prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from proposing or finalizing rules without making public all scientific and technical evidence used in support of the proposed rule or regulation.\n \nFor far too long, the EPA has approved regulations that have placed a crippling financial burden on taxpayers without public evidence to justify their actions. According to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, only ‘qualified or real scientists’ should be allowed to see data sets that validate public policy. The concept of having a government that runs substantially on secret information is outrageous.\n \nI will be talking on the House Floor about this bill before our vote tomorrow afternoon. Stay tuned for the live video link.	745981225450928
150338151681908	I am thankful for the checks and balances of our government. Without them, we'd be in serious hot water. #gratitudechallenge #balancingact	743774035671647

209486545087	Today I voted YES on H. Res. 233. America stands with its own, and Iran must release the three Americans it currently holds imprisoned.	10155732595585088
209486545087	“Today is mine. Tomorrow is none of my business. If I peer anxiously into the fog of the future, I will strain my spiritual eyes so that I will not see clearly what is required of me now.” - Elisabeth Elliot (1926-2015)\n\nHeaven is rejoicing as one more soul enters the Gates of Splendor.	10155732224380088
209486545087	Today is Flag Day, and I am very grateful for our nation's flag and everything for which it stands. Stephen Crane captures the significance of the flag in his classic "The Red Badge of Courage" in such a vivid way:\n\n"Within him, as he hurled himself forward, was born a love, a despairing fondness for this flag which was near him. It was a creation of beauty and invulnerability. It was a goddess, radiant, that bended its form with an imperious gesture to him. It was a woman, red and white, hating and loving, that called him with the voice of his hopes. Because no harm could come to it he endowed it with power."	10155729382155088
209486545087	Today marks the anniversary of D-Day, when thousands of American and Allied troops sacrificed their lives for the cause of human freedom. One can only imagine what these brave souls must have been thinking as their landing crafts neared the beachheads of Normandy with the sound of artillery fire penetrating the air above their heads, knowing that in mere moments they would come face to face with the mortality of life itself. Still yet, they did not think of themselves, but of the people they were helping to liberate, rushing out of the boats, one by one, until their objectives were realized. The world owes a great debt of gratitude to all those who fought and to those who paid the ultimate price on this day. These soldiers fought so nobly to stop a madman from forever compromising the meaning of freedom; and through their heroic actions, millions were rescued from a fate that had been pressed upon them.	10155699969710088
209486545087	Josie and I were saddened to hear last night of the passing of Vice President Joe Biden's son Beau. Issues of life or death transcend partisan politics, and we hope that the Bidens are comforted by their faith, family, friends and countrymen in this time of mourning. Our thoughts and prayers are with their family.	10155679083225088
209486545087	This weekend, as you enjoy time with friends and family, take a moment to remember those who have given all for this country and if you can, take a few moments to reflect on this, the third verse of America the Beautiful,\n"O beautiful for heroes proved \nIn liberating strife. \nWho more than self their country loved\nAnd mercy more than life! \nAmerica! America! \nMay God thy gold refine \nTill all success be nobleness \nAnd every gain divine!"	10155632552620088
209486545087	I had the pleasure today of a visit from the Nashville Songwriters Association.  We discussed copyright issues and were treated to a musical number by some very talented people.	10155616222750088
209486545087	Amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act will be voted on throughout the evening. This bill funds national security at the level the pentagon requested to meet our national security strategy - we fought long and hard in committee for that top line number. You can watch the debate LIVE on C-SPAN.	10155588918970088
209486545087	After a very encouraging victory with House passage of #HR36 last night, we are back at it today to protect freedoms. The USA Freedom Act prevents government overreach by prohibiting large-scale, indiscriminate data collection, such as all records from an entire state, city, or zip code.	10155587869485088
209486545087	Happy Mother's Day!\nTo all the moms - may your hearts be filled with joy today as your families express their love, gratitude and appreciation for every sacrifice you have made.	10155572550910088
209486545087	Last night I voted YES for the FY2016 Budget which cuts more than $5 trillion, ensures the National Defense by supporting our military and the resources necessary to counter global threats, repeals Obamacare, and saves, strengthens, and secures Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. \n\nThis is a victory for the American people and further evidence that Republicans are committed to a healthy economy built on opportunity and the same fiscal discipline that American families live by every day.	10155544105945088
209486545087	Today is Missile Defense Day on the Hill. Our military needs the most advanced missile defense systems in order to protect our homeland from external threats. \n\nThe event held today, hosted by National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA)in the Rayburn Foyer from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm, will include opportunities for Members, congressional staff, associations, and industry representatives to discuss and better understand those needs.\n\nThere will also be a reception from 5:00 to 7:00 pm where I will be addressing the group.	10155510924920088
209486545087	Today I voted YES on HR 1105 the Death Tax Repeal Act. The crippling consequences of the Estate Tax need to end now. Family businesses and farms need tax relief to help our economy grow again.	10155482368615088
78476240421	I had a very nice exchange with about 35 seniors here at Laguna Beach High School and was very impressed with the young people that I met.	10155633742170422
209486545087	On Holocaust Remembrance Day we say "never again". But can we really keep that promise when this Administration refuses to take a hard stand against an Iranian regime that still seeks the complete annihilation of the Jewish people and of the Jewish state?	10155480077750088

209486545087	This morning as we celebrate the resurrection of Christ the Savior, let us all be reminded that not even death could defeat God's eternal plan.  I pray God's divine peace, joy and provision for you and your family.   He is risen!   He is risen indeed!	10155435603510088

209486545087	No organization in America has caused the death of more innocent and helpless children than Planned Parenthood.  They support abortion on demand throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy for any reason or no reason. It is a disgrace that taxpayers are forced to give one dime to such an organization. This report, released today, requested by pro-life Members in 2013, highlights the grotesque bill the American Taxpayers have been footing for the abortion industry.\n\nNow that we know where the funding is coming from, we can take more direct aim at cutting it entirely.\n\nhttp://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-270R	10155395493280088
209486545087	My deep sorrow and heartfelt condolences go out to Arizona State Senator Steve Pierce and his family during this difficult time in the loss of his son. Josie, my staff, and I all have him, his wife Joan, and daughter-in-law Amilyn in our thoughts and prayers.	10155382902350088
209486545087	Today I had the pleasure of addressing the National Federation of Republican Women during their Legislative Day on Capitol Hill. What a joy to see you all! Thank you for all you do.	10155370141370088
209486545087	Congratulations to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו on his reelection. May the United States and Israel continue to be the closest of friends for years to come.	10155366061310088
209486545087	The #DHSfundingbill was our last and best hope of stopping the President's unconstitutional immigration actions. I voted against the bill as it was presented today on the House Floor because it did nothing to defund those unconstitutional actions. While I am uncomfortable with a #DHSshutdown, I am even more uncomfortable with a complete shutdown of the Constitution.	10155307460505088
209486545087	Prime Minister Netanyahu's address was the most statesmanlike speech I've heard on this floor since I've come to Congress. It is a disgrace that beggars description that the Administration was absent. Barack Obama should have used this to bring world leaders together to counter this unspeakable danger that threatens the entire human family.	10155306652290088
143344975723788	Today in 1777, the United States officially adopted our national flag, the Star-Spangled Banner. From our military bases abroad to our greatest cities and smallest towns, the sight of our flag is a reminder that we reside in the land of the free and the home of the brave.	904648689593409
143344975723788	Along with the other members of our delegation, I'm pleased to announce that 11 Arkansas airports have been awarded funding to support facility upgrades and expansions. Several of them were in our District, including Ash Flat, Clarendon, Corning, De Witt, and Newport. Modern airport infrastructure paves the way for regional growth by allowing local businesses and tourism to flourish. Our communities will be well served by these improvements that set the stage for job growth and increase connectivity throughout our state.	899178556807089

143344975723788	Earlier this morning, the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced their completion of the final “Waters of the US” rule, which regulates what rivers, streams, and wetlands are subject to federal oversight. Despite an overwhelming number of public comments requesting a significant modification or complete revocation of this rule, the administration has decided to ignore both the opinion of Congress and the American people by pushing forward with this large expansion of federal authority for small and seasonal bodies of water already regulated at the state level. The ambiguous wording of Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule could subject landowners, farmers, and ranchers to jurisdictional challenges and unprecedented levels of compliance costs. I strongly urge a thorough overhaul of the WOTUS rule that takes into consideration the hundreds of thousands of negative comments filed against it. The bipartisan House-passed Regulatory Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 1732) would send the rule back to the drawing board, and I hope the Senate moves quickly to pass this legislation.	895415073850104
143344975723788	Tuesday I sent a letter to the House Committee on Ways and Means strongly urging consideration of legislation granting stronger enforcement remedies for U.S. trade laws. While the letter acknowledges the positive impact TPA could have on our economy by opening up new markets for American products, it also highlights the past transgressions of foreign nations in trade agreements and the need for vigilant protections of American products in the face of evasive maneuvers by our trade partners. Twenty-four other members of Congress signed the letter requesting the judicious application of trade laws to keep American businesses on a level playing field. Free trade with other countries shouldn't be only free, but fair.\n\nClick the link below to read the letter.\n\nhttp://crawford.house.gov/uploadedfiles/trade_letter.pdf	893342917390653
143344975723788	One night while BBKing was playing in Twist (just northeast of Wynne), two men began fighting over a woman and accidentally set the building on fire. King ran back inside to save his guitar, which afterwards he began calling Lucille, the name of the woman the two men desired.\n\nKing and Lucille gave the Delta region, and in fact people everywhere, a musical voice like no one else. He will be sorely missed.	890085721049706
143344975723788	I would like to wish all the mothers across the First District, including my wife Stacy, a very happy Mothers Day.  I remember how my mom, like so many moms, wore so many different hats than just the one that bore the title mom.  Our mothers work so hard for everyone in their family and often times outside their family which was something I experienced as a kid when my mom helped coach my soccer team while my dad was away while serving in the Air Force.  Today I hope you get to honor your mother for all that she has done for you and others in your family.  Happy Mothers Day to all the mothers out there - you deserve it!	887955417929403
143344975723788	I met with with the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management to discuss their needs and bomb squad equipment. Afterwards, we took a tour of their facility to discuss other emergency management issues. These guys do a lot to keep us all safe, and they certainly deserve our support and gratitude.	887348494656762
143344975723788	Our 1st District of Arkansas is filled with natural beauty. The Buffalo and White rivers are just two of the natural wonders and resources that our District offers. It's a great day to be in Baxter County!	885847888140156
143344975723788	I voted today to repeal the death tax. First introduced after World War I to help repay massive war debts, this tax has held on to life for nearly a century. This tax requires many small businesses and farms to sell off equipment, land, or other capital after the death of the owner, a requirement which adds insult to injury after a loved one's passing. This tax actually punishes success because it can cause family farms and businesses to be broken up and sold off. The death tax has far outlived its expiration date, and it's time for it to go.	876830065708605
143344975723788	Greg Chance, news director for Arkansas State's radio station KASU, died tragically last night after he suffered a heart attack. Greg has worked at KASU since 1982, and through his time and efforts there became an invaluable member of the community. Please keep his wife, Cindy, in your prayers.	876207359104209
143344975723788	Every spring the Congressional Institute sponsors a nationwide high school visual art competition to recognize and encourage artistic talent in the nation and in each congressional district. This year, our office received 61 entries: that's almost double the number of entires we had last year!	873591416032470
143344975723788	The EAST Program at Douglas MacArthur has teamed up with The Downtown Jonesboro Association to find an artist interested in creating a public mural in Jonesboro's downtown to celebrate the city's history and culture. Today, I visited their class to see what other projects they've been working on and to talk about the mural. It was impressive to see students who are so interested and invested in their home community, and I'm excited to see what mural they choose for the downtown area.	873290192729259
143344975723788	Last week I toured the ASU Mountain Home Technical Center which opened last fall.  The center is a partnership of the university and community in developing technical programs which will provide hands-on training for students in areas such as welding, auto mechanics, electronics, and air conditioning technology. I was impressed!	873157479409197
143344975723788	Today Arkansas lost one of its most venerable and distinguished sons. John Paul Hammerschmidt was truly a visionary champion for Arkansas’ conservative values in Congress, but we will all remember him for his humble dedication to our country and to our state. His leadership inspired new generations of Arkansans, and his record of service is now the gold standard for the Arkansas delegation.	869145856477026
143344975723788	Yesterday, Bonnie Thrasher passed away. As a journalism instructor at ASU, she mentored many of our young students and helped others follow their passion by advising the student newspaper, The Herald.  A member of the ASU faculty for more than 20 years, her service, passion, and inspiration to her community will be sorely missed. My condolences go out to her family.	869074689817476
143344975723788	The Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management had it's first hearing today, where we examined the implementation of the 2014 Farm Bill.	866364663421812
143344975723788	The budget blueprints put forward today called for the passage of a balanced budget amendment for the first time since I was elected to Congress, but without any legal binding authority, this non-binding resolution can be ignored and no action has to be taken. Sadly, since being elected to Congress, we have voted once on permanent spending controls in the form of a balanced budget amendment that was required by law as a result of the Budget Control Act.\n\nUntil Congress accepts that non-binding budget resolutions are ineffective without a permanent law like a balanced budget amendment or spending limitation amendment, the budget process will only be an exercise in futility and our debt crisis will continue on its current path.	866053443452934
143344975723788	Earlier today, Richard Bell passed away. As the first Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture, Riceland Foods CEO, and passionate advocate of Arkansas agriculture, Richard leaves behind a legacy of leadership that will be sorely missed. My condolences go out to his family.	860133734044905
143344975723788	I met with the ORACLE Advisory board at Ozarka College yesterday in Melbourne. I appreciated everyone's thoughts and comments.	858623704195908
143344975723788	Two weeks ago, I signed onto Chairman Bob Goodlatte's letter opposing the newly proposed ATF ammo ban. I am pleased to announce that as of this afternoon, the ATF has withdrawn their proposal and said "you spoke, we listened." Thank you to everyone who contacted my office to express your concerns, this is a victory for Second Amendment rights.	857947007596911
143344975723788	Today, several Arkansans were honored for all their hard work within the Agriculture industry and were inducted into the Arkansas Agriculture Hall of Fame. Pictured below is Alice Nix accepting the award on behalf of her husband Bill, who is being posthumously inducted into the hall of fame, and John Ed Regenold giving remarks after his own induction.	855899441135001
143344975723788	My offices will be closed today because of the winter weather we got yesterday and last night.  We will monitor reports across the First District for updates about road conditions as well as other issues that may impact folks and pass along here.  You can also keep up with road conditions and other closures by following me on Twitter, @RepRickCrawford.	855182427873369
143344975723788	Last July, I voted against a VA reform bill in part because it rewarded the agency's mismanagement by reinstating bonuses to senior VA employees. These bonuses, originally removed by the House, should not have been reinstated until significant improvements were made towards greater transparency and overall reforms that would make the VA less bureaucratic and more veteran centered.  For that reason, I commend the passage of H.R. 280, which allows the VA Secretary to recoup bonuses from those employees. While H.R. 280 eliminates a poorly thought out policy, the work is still far from over. As a veteran from a family of veterans, the care of those who sacrifice themselves for the security of our nation is close to my heart. I will continue to look for ways we can reform the Veterans Administration, particularly by increasing transparency, so that the organization can be monitored and held accountable for its actions.	854809467910665

200227780116038	Great to meet with Peter Jake Daniels -- a student from Sir Francis Drake High School -- and three of the Marin County veterans he interviewed for the Veterans History Project. Their stories will be archived for posterity in The Library of Congress alongside interviews with thousands of other veterans from around the country. \n\nThis is an amazing project to collect, preserve and make accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war.\n\nFor more information, visit: http://www.loc.gov/vets/	480541148751365
200227780116038	Last week the US Postal Service announced misguided plans to close Processing Centers in Petaluma and Eureka. This decision will result in the loss of hundreds of postal staff positions, and would be especially difficult for seniors and veterans who rely on timely delivery of prescriptions and other postal services.\n\nI am strongly opposed to this plan and working to prevent these closures from happening.\n\nhttp://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20140704/articles/140709827#page=0	426979207440893

200227780116038	Met with some of the original "Rosie the Riveters" yesterday! Phyllis and the ‘Rosie the Riveters’ played a pivotal role in our nation’s history and proved that women can do anything a man can do. \n\nThese remarkable women – including my own grandmother who worked in the Martin bomber plant in Omaha, Nebraska – stepped up in a time of great need and helped win a war, all while building the foundation for future generations of American women to succeed. I’m very happy that they could be recognized for what they are: American heroes. http://1.usa.gov/PtegAw	388259854646162
200227780116038	Happy Veterans Day. Those who have served our country in the military, often at great risk to themselves and sacrifice to their families, deserve our respect, gratitude, and the veterans services they were promised.	329623120509836

182567716746	This week, I had to return to California due to an emergency health situation involving my 94-year-old mother. Had I remained in Washington for votes this week, I would have voted ‘no’ on reconsideration of #HR37, a bill that includes a number of modifications to existing Wall Street regulations. Last week, I voted for this legislation, because while I oppose delaying the Volcker Rule for two years, there are several other elements of the bill I do support. However, since then, I have conducted a more exhaustive study of the bill and its implications, and I have heard from many of my constituents who believe delaying our laws related to speculative investments by commercial banks, even for two years, is too risky. \n\nAfter much consideration of the policy consequences of this legislation, I cannot support H.R. 37. We need to secure the investments of hardworking Americans and stabilize our financial markets, and there is too much potential harm in delaying implementation of the Volcker Rule from 2017 to 2019. For similar reasons, I have long advocated for the restoration of Glass-Steagall.\n\nAs a representative, I carefully consider input from constituents, and I was impressed by the outpouring of grassroots mobilization on this important issue. Thank you to every constituent who called or corresponded with my office. Please continue to keep my office informed about your priorities. As always, it is an honor to represent you in Congress.	10152989779671747
182567716746	Senator Barbara Boxer is an outstanding Senator and public servant. Her leadership on protecting our precious natural resources in particular will be greatly missed. She has always believed that we owe it to the American people to do everything possible to create American jobs and grow American paychecks. And she was the rare Senator with the wisdom to vote against the disastrous Iraq War, a war with major ripple effects that continue to hamper American foreign policy today. Fortunately, she will represent California for two more years in the Senate, and I will work closely with her during that time.	10152979033686747
182567716746	Today at 2:30 PM PT (5:30 PM ET), I will appear on msnbc's The Ed Show to discuss the global economic and diplomatic impact of low oil and gas prices.	10152939317711747

182567716746	Today I informed my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus that I intend on running as the Ranking Member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where I currently serve as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation. As Ranking Member, I would help shape and lead our priorities and message on this vital committee. I want T&I to aggressively move forward with #MakeItInAmerica legislation to make sure that when we invest in infrastructure with our tax dollars, we're creating good middle class jobs here in America. \n\nAs I told my colleagues, "A demonstrated ability to preserve Democratic ideals while working across the aisle to get things done will be crucial in the next Congress, and particularly in this Committee. With major legislative initiatives on the horizon that include surface transportation, FAA, and Amtrak reauthorization, the Democratic transportation agenda calls for a strong, inclusive, proactive leader who looks beyond divisive dualities to facilitate opportunity, momentum, and results. This is the leadership I aim to bring."\n\nYou can read the full letter here: http://bit.ly/tiranking	10152841550651747

7109195747	Just voted no on TPA. American workers deserve a stronger deal than the “fast track” bill that passed the House. We should do all we can to grow exports because it means more jobs, but it cannot be done at the expense of American workers, health and safety, and the environment. I will continue pushing for a strong, fair trade deal that grows our economy and creates good American jobs.	10153004282755748
7109195747	This morning we woke to horrific news of a tragic shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. that left 9 people dead. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and all the people of Charleston.	10153003876630748
7109195747	Toured Watershed Materials, a Napa-based company that designs and manufactures a green, low carbon, sustainable building product called the Watershed Block. Watershed Materials was awarded a Small Business Innovation Research grant in September of 2014 from the National Science Foundation to further develop and commercialize structural masonry with zero cement. It’s great to represent innovative businesses like these.	10153000252585748
7109195747	Toured Kreysler & Associates in American Canyon and met with the company’s employees. Kreysler & Associates has been leading the way in the use of composite materials in construction since its establishment in 1982. The company brings proven marine materials and techniques to the construction industry, and is an internationally recognized enterprise known for its innovation, creativity and craftsmanship. It’s a privilege to represent such a great businesses.	10152995946650748
7109195747	Had a great visit at Silverado Middle School. The students were bright and asked great questions. Many thanks to our wonderful teachers for all their good work.	10152994296320748
7109195747	We need to focus on passing a good trade bill that grows our economy, boosts exports and creates good American jobs. The “fast track” bill on the floor today falls short and I do not support it. We should do all we can to grow exports because it means more jobs, but it cannot be done at the expense of American workers, health and safety, and the environment.	10152992497515748
7109195747	Had a great time celebrating our Filipino community’s heritage, pride, culture & traditions at the Vallejo Pista sa Nayon parade.	10152989274835748

7109195747	Spoke at a service over Memorial Day at the George C. Yount Pioneer Cemetery to commemorate the  150th Anniversary of George C. Yount’s passing and to honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. While George is the only veteran buried in these grounds who has the town of Yountville named after him, there are many heroes who call this cemetery their final resting place. Some 100 veterans have been laid to rest here. We salute their service, we honor President of the Yountville Cemetery Association Lee Hart, and we thank the Native Daughters of the Golden West Chapter 322 which began hosting this annual Memorial Day Service in 1958.	10152980736205748
7109195747	Recently convened a bipartisan meeting with Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald to discuss the backlog at the VA and how we can work together to make sure our veterans are getting the benefits they have earned in a timely manner.	10152978985845748
7109195747	It was a great honor to give the commencement address at Napa Valley College – the very school where I enrolled on the GI Bill after returning from Vietnam. Congratulations to the Class of 2015 on your amazing success!	10152977703765748
7109195747	Participated in a hearing today on domestic violence, guns and the need for comprehensive and enforceable background checks. Every month, nearly 50 American women are shot to death by a current or former boyfriend or spouse. In states that require background checks, 46 percent fewer women are shot to death by intimate partners. Background checks save lives, and that’s why I have written bipartisan legislation that would require comprehensive, enforceable background checks for all commercial gun sales in all 50 states. If this bill is passed, domestic abusers won’t be able to bypass a background check by simply going online or to a gun show.	10152976498875748
7109195747	Great news: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) notified CalVet that the Yountville Veterans Home’s star rating will increase from 2 to 3 stars.  The CMS rating measures quality of care and staffing in nursing homes.  This accomplishment is owed to the dedicated staff caring for our veterans and the work of our new Administrator, Don Veverka. Congratulations and keep up the outstanding, and important, work.	10152974364370748
7109195747	Met with Councilwoman Debbie McKillop and toured Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Forensics Lab in Martinez. Many thanks to all of our law enforcement officers for the work they do to keep our communities safe.	10152970421460748

The Veterans History Project of the Library of Congress American Folklife Center was created by the U.S. Congress to collect, preserve and make accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war. Many thanks to all our students, veterans and teachers for their phenomenal work to make sure these important stories are preserved.	10152969214120748
7109195747	One of the highest honors I have as a Representative in Congress is getting to annually nominate exceptional candidates from our community to the service academies. This year, I am proud to announce three young men from our 5th Congressional District have been accepted. Two will be attending the U.S. Naval Academy and one will be attending the United States Military Academy at West Point. These three young men will receive both a world class education and the skills they need to become tomorrow’s leaders. Congratulations to each of them on their remarkable achievement. http://mikethompson.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/thompson-annouces-service-academy-appointees	10152966917870748
7109195747	Participated in the Touro University Flagpole Ceremony where we dedicated their refurbished historic flagpole in front of the old Mare Island Naval Hospital. I was privileged to provide the flag which was previously flown over the United States Capitol. This flag will now fly high above an island that is a rich part of America’s military history – and in front of a hospital that cared for so many brave servicemembers who fought under the same flag overseas.	10152961274365748
7109195747	Attended the Memorial Day service at Sonoma Veterans Memorial Park where we commemorated the 10 year dedication of the “Star of Honor” which bears the name of all deceased Sonoma County veterans.	10152951264110748

7109195747	Recognized Herb Salinger for the amazing work he’s done in education at an event for Hearts and Hands Preschool in Calistoga. Preschool is the foundation for future success. Our students will carry what they learn at schools such as Hearts and Hands through the rest of their academic, personal and professional lives.	10152942349440748

7109195747	Visited Lake County Library to read short stories with kids in commemoration of National Library Week.	10152931324415748
282703023118	I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Beau Biden. He was an outstanding veteran and public servant, and the dedication he showed to his family and the people of Delaware should be a model for us all. I extend my most heartfelt condolences to my friends Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden, as well as the rest of the Biden family.	10153308448113119
282703023118	I had a wonderful time at the DigIn! Dinner last week at the West Sacramento Farmers Market. It was a blast cooking with chef Chris Jarosz of Broderick Roadhouse, and using fresh local produce to create a delicious meal.	10153308370888119
282703023118	On Wednesday, I had a great time visiting with students from John Reith Elementary School that are taking part in the Department of Defense’s STARBASE Academy.  The goal of the program is to encourage students to continue their studies in the STEM fields and by what I saw today, I am sure many will!	10153305377348119
528662157146886	Happy to visit with everyone at Kids Day in the Park yesterday in Rancho Cordova. This annual event helps connect children and families to important health and community resources. Thank you to all who make this event happen!	957628984250199
282703023118	I have worked hard in Congress to keep flood insurance affordable, so I was troubled to hear from a few constituents in Natomas who have gotten incorrect flood insurance bills. I want to make sure everyone has the right information so they do not overpay for flood insurance. \n\nRates for Natomas residents are currently about $470 a year. Natomas is in a special program called “Properties Newly Mapped,” and I was pleased to support legislation last year that limits rate increases to 18% a year. If you get a bill from your insurance company that shows you owing more than $470, you can get an official letter from the City of Sacramento stating that Natomas residents qualify for the “Properties Newly Mapped” program. \n\nResidents can contact the city at floodinfo@cityofsacramento.org or (916) 808-5061 to get a personalized letter that they can present to their insurance company to show that they are entitled to the $470 rate.  If you have questions, please call my office at (916) 498-5600.	10153290267303119
282703023118	Today we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the launch of Head Start! Head Start is a wonderful program that provides children access to preschool programs. Early education helps children succeed in school, and allows parents to work knowing that their child is cared for. Over the years, I’ve been honored to join these great young learners in their classrooms – for them and all the future Head Start students in Sacramento, I will continue to support this vital program. #HeadStart50	10153258231783119
282703023118	It’s been a great week for two Sacramento non-profit health care clinics. Cares Community Health has been designated as a full Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) by the Department of Health and Human Services, which will allow it to expand their quality comprehensive services to more local residents.  And, Elica Health Centers received a federal grant of over $704,000, which will allow it to open an additional health clinic, expand mobile health services and offer additional treatment services, such as physical therapy and nutrition assistance.	10153230502428119
282703023118	I really enjoyed meeting yesterday with leaders of Sutter Health’s Anderson Lucchetti Women’s and Children’s Center, where I learned about the center’s cutting-edge treatment options like those available in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU. The center holds 60 isolation units that control temperature and sound as needed in providing advanced care for premature babies.	10153227258373119
282703023118	Today I, along with Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA), introduced bipartisan House Resolution 244 to recognize May as Mental Health Month. Mental health care has been ignored for far too long in this country. I am co-leading this resolution to recognize the importance of mental health and the critical need to reduce its stigma.\n\nThis builds upon my efforts to expand mental health services across the country. I recently introduced the Mental Health First Aid Act, which would increase training to help emergency services personnel, police officers, educators, and the public identify, understand, and respond to mental health crises. I am also actively involved in implementation of the demonstration project based on my Excellence in Mental Health Act that will provide $1 billion in funding for community behavioral health clinics.	10153217631088119
282703023118	In November, I was pleased to support the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency in their application to designate a #PromiseZone in Sacramento. Today, I am thrilled to announce that the good news is official – SHRA’s application was approved. The Promise Zone designation will help to provide additional resources to our region and will allow Sacramento to receive preferences for competitive federal programs and grants.	10153210457953119
282703023118	I ended yesterday by meeting with the Cap-to-Cap Healthcare team.  Dr. Karen DeSalvo, the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, discussed the ongoing transformation of healthcare delivery and payment.\n\nI started this morning by meeting with the Cap-to-Cap Flood Protection team, where we had a good discussion about how we continue to build on the progress made for our region's flood protection.	10153192991608119
282703023118	Every year hundreds of business and community leaders from the Sacramento region come to Washington DC as part of the Cap to Cap trip.  This year’s trip is well underway, and it is great to see so many people here in DC advocating for our region.  I was pleased to address attendees at this year’s luncheon, and was thrilled that U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew was able to speak about the Administration’s work to move our economy forward.	10153190986103119
282703023118	Earlier today I attended and spoke at the ribbon cutting ceremony for the new Behavioral Health Inpatient Care Unit at the Mather VA hospital.  We have a duty to the men and women who bravely put their lives on the line to defend our country, and we must ensure they have access to the health care they need and deserve.  This new behavioral health clinic is an important part of this goal, as it will provide a place of hope and healing for an estimated 840 veterans each year.	10153164912813119
282703023118	This morning I had the opportunity to visit Shasta Linens and meet their hardworking employees.  Shasta Linens has been a long time family-owned business leader in Sacramento.  They have worked hard to be a responsible company, are reducing water use, recycling old linens and use environmental friendly cleaning products.	10153164694958119
282703023118	A major milestone was met yesterday, as FEMA’s remapping of Natomas from a Zone AE to Zone A99 has come to a conclusion.  Starting in mid-June, the City of Sacramento will once again have jurisdiction over building in Natomas and I am pleased they have put forward a responsible and reasonable plan that promotes public safety and allows some building to resume while work continues on the levee improvements that are so crucial.  Even though the map change has moved forward insurance is still required. I’ve worked to keep rates as low as possible.  Residents are eligible for FEMA’s Properties Newly Mapped rate (formerly called the PRP-EE rate), which costs about $480 a year.	10153145002283119
282703023118	ICYMI: My staff will be hosting office hours at the North Highlands Antelope Library ( 4235 Antelope Road) tomorrow from 6:00 to 8:00pm.  If you have an issue with a federal agency, such as veterans benefits, Social Security, or an immigration matter, or, if you just want to make your voice heard, please come on by.	10153124921403119
282703023118	Great, energetic & insightful conversation today with a number of local women. There is a real passion in Sacramento to ensure all women have access to quality, affordable child care, and a desire to ensure women have the ability to succeed as business owners.	10153098344158119
282703023118	Yesterday, I had a great meeting with representatives from the California Alliance for Retired Americans.  We discussed the importance of strengthening and improving Medicare, and they dropped off postcards from local residents who support Medicare.	10153097963863119
528662157146886	Thank you to all of the volunteers who came out today for ReIMAGINE Mack Road Day. Together we helped clean up and improve the Mack Road corridor to make sure our community is safe, vibrant, and thriving.  #ReimagineMackRd	957161687630262
282703023118	Today I hosted a roundtable lunch with local women business owners at California Capital’s Small Business Administration certified Women Business Center.  It was great to talk about the opportunities and challenges facing women business owners in today’s economic climate, share resources available through California Capital and the SBA, and hear about the amazing things our local businesses are doing.	10153094005448119
282703023118	Great time catching up at the Rotary Club of Sacramento meeting yesterday!	10153093114438119
282703023118	Today is #InternationalWomensDay, a time to celebrate the many achievements of women, while reaffirming our commitment to equality for all women. We have come a long way, but there is more work to be done to ensure that every woman, in every country, has the opportunity to succeed. Working together, I know we can "Make It Happen!"	10153086263033119
282703023118	Today is the 50th Anniversary of "Bloody Sunday."  On March 7, 1965, a group of brave civil rights marchers marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on their way to Montgomery to demand that African American citizens be finally given their constitutional right to vote.  At the bridge the marchers were attacked and injured by Alabama state troopers.  On this anniversary, we honor the courage and commitment of those marchers and reaffirm our own commitment to stamping out discrimination and protecting voting rights for all Americans.  #Selma50	10153084114343119
282703023118	Today is a historic day for the Internet Age.  After a record four million public comments and months of debate, the FCC has passed strong net neutrality rules that will protect consumers, small businesses, and encourage innovation. With the absolute ban on paid prioritization, the rules adopted today by the FCC will ensure that all data is treated equally – a cornerstone principle of the Internet. Today’s rules are a step in the right direction; however this is not the end of the road. Tomorrow we must roll up our sleeves and continue the fight to preserve net neutrality.	10153063205168119
282703023118	This morning I spoke at the Communications and Technology Subcommittee hearing about the importance of tomorrow's FCC vote on net neutrality. This vote is critically important, but it will not be the end of the road.  In some ways it will be the beginning of the fight to preserve net neutrality, and protect consumers and encourage innovation. This is a fight I intend to stay engaged with, to make sure all Americans have access to a free and open Internet.	10153060829963119
282703023118	On Friday, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell visited Sacramento to announce $50 million for drought relief projects in the West, including nearly $20 million for California's Central Valley Project. While she was here, we had the opportunity to tour Folsom Dam and the Joint Federal Project, showing her firsthand the realities of our drought crisis.	10153025282213119
528662157146886	I had the chance to tour the new Folsom Cordova Sacramento Works Training Facility, a great partnership between the Sacramento Employment and Training Agency, the Folsom Cordova Community Partnership, and the Folsom Cordova Unified School District.  It was great to see how they work together to give people the skills they need enter the workforce.	979356522077445
528662157146886	We must honor our promises to our seniors. That is why I have asked representatives for Medicare and Social Security resources to join my staff on a district tour to bring resources, answer questions, and help seniors one on one with the federal benefits they've earned and that I have promised to protect and strengthen. If you need help with Medicare or Social Security, please call my office at 635 0505 or visit bera.house.gov/gethelp	977475675598863

528662157146886	My wife Janine and I had a great morning at the 11th annual Kaiser Permanente Women's Fitness Festival. This great event brings generations of women together to celebrate health and wellness while benefiting WEAVE (Women Escaping A Violent Environment). WEAVE is focused on supporting all survivors and bringing and end to domestic violence and sexual assault in our community.	976568982356199
528662157146886	Alzheimer’s is the 6th leading cause of death in the U.S. As a doctor and as the former Chief Medical Officer of Sacramento County, I’m very concerned about how this disease is impacting our parents and grandparents. That’s why my office hosted today's Brain Health Forum with the Alzheimer's Association and the UCDavis Alzheimer's Disease Research Center to provide local residents with information on the latest in Alzheimer’s research and what community resources are available to assist caregivers and persons living with Alzheimer’s or other dementias.

528662157146886	I'm saddened to learn of the passing of Beau Biden tonight. He was a dedicated public servant, father, husband, son, and friend who left us far too soon. Janine and I send our thoughts and prayers to Vice President Biden, the entire Biden family, and the people of Delaware.	972875612725536
528662157146886	I was honored to join our local community at the 9th annual Rancho Cordova Memorial Day Ceremony at the Mather VA. We should take a moment every day, not just today to honor our fallen troops.	970544816291949
528662157146886	Enjoyed speaking to all of the runners and supporters at the start of the 5th annual Wounded Veteran Run this Memorial Day morning. This event was started by a local personal trainer whose brother was severely injured while serving in Afghanistan.	970428036303627
528662157146886	Enjoyed attending the Rancho Cordova Legislative Reception hosted by the Rancho Cordova Chamber this week. We talked about how we can work together to provide the information and resources our region needs to grow and prosper.	963238310355933
528662157146886	Our state of California and our entire nation is blessed to have a vibrant Mexican American community. On this #CincoDeMayo, let us remember the bravery and sacrifices of the Mexican fighters who fought for freedom.  Feliz Cindo de Mayo!	962052097141221
528662157146886	As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I was honored to help welcome Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to The White House yesterday.

528662157146886	Thanks to NCIM El Dorado Molds in Rancho Cordova for letting me see their business recently. They make molds for everything from auto parts to sunglasses, and are a great example of a successful company in our area that is growing in part because of help they received from the U.S. Small Business Administration. Ensuring government is a strategic partner, not an obstacle, is critical for growing our local economy and my office is here to connect our businesses with the tools they need to grow and hire.	947758231903941
528662157146886	From my family to yours, we wish a very Happy Easter to all who are celebrating today.	946573292022435

528662157146886	California’s historic drought is impacting our community in many  different ways. I had a good discussion with the folks at Sacramento Yolo Mosquito & Vector Control District last week about the challenges they're facing due to the drought and the work they’re doing to protect our public health, like providing insect repellent and educating the public on how to fight the bite. Thank you for all you do! www.FightTheBite.net	943655142314250
528662157146886	I had the opportunity to sit down and talk with leadership and employees of Frontier Communications this afternoon to learn more about their business and listen to their concerns. They are providers of local and long-distance telephone service, broadband Internet, and digital television service. We had a great discussion about growing our region's economy, supporting our Veterans, and how to address the drought. Thank you to Frontier for inviting me!	942279405785157
528662157146886	I served lunch to seniors at the Senior Center of Elk Grove as part of the national March for Meals campaign today with Meals on Wheels by ACC.

528662157146886	Thank you to the leadership team at UC Davis Children's Hospital for the tour and discussion today. It’s great to see all the good work being done here.	938868942792870
528662157146886	In case you missed it, I was honored to receive Planned Parenthood's Women’s Health Champion Award last night. Only one member of the House of Representatives receives this award each year, and I’m incredibly humbled by their recognition of my work on protecting women’s health care. As a father of a daughter and a doctor, this is a very personal issue to me. A woman’s health decisions should be between her and her doctor, not Washington politicians or bosses. #ICYMI → http://1.usa.gov/193z2Qr	937785292901235

You all are smart and motivated, and I'm glad to be on your team!	10152730955503981
6553468980	Last night Mary and I had a chance to say thank you to all of our interns and staff who worked so hard on this campaign. We had more than 50 interns donate over 2,000 hours of their time this fall: knocking on doors, making phone calls, and helping get out the vote. We are so proud of these kids and it's hard to say goodbye to them, but they leave knowing how important they were to our success!	10152532017538981
6553468980	I had to wait a few extra days to say this, but we won!! Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to help us get here. Thank you for your support, your time, your good wishes, and your energy.  It is my honor to continue to represent you in Washington.  I will have more to say in the days ahead, but I wanted to make sure I said a big “Thank You!” before I said anything else.	10152526431793981

6553468980	My team of volunteers and I joined my good friend Ami Bera and the Bera for Congress team to knock on doors and visit with voters in his district today. Ami and I both believe in putting our middle class families first and I know how much he cares about the folks he represents.\n\nOutside Republican groups have spent over $7 million in ads against Ami. Can you believe it? These GOP groups don't represent the interests of our region, so we need to do everything we can to get the message out and get folks to the polls on November 4.	10152486714748981
6553468980	I've got a great group of volunteers who came out the other night to make calls reminding folks to vote. I really appreciate everyone taking time to help, including Stockton Councilwoman Dyane Burgos Medina.

We will never forget.	10152406054073981
6553468980	I'm proud to have earned the endorsement of The Veterans Vision, a national publication focused on the well-being of those who have served our nation.

6553468980	I hope all the moms out there had a great Mother's Day!\n\nIt's difficult for those of us who aren't moms to understand the sacrifices they make for us. They give physically, emotionally, and financially to make sure we grow up safe and loved.\n\nI want to thank all moms for all they do, with a personal thanks to my mother for giving me her love, and a special thank you to my wife, Mary, for being such a loving and giving mother to our three children.	10152155869973981
6553468980	I had a great time at this year's Cinco de Mayo parade in Stockton, accompanied by my beautiful daughter Windy McNerney.\n\nWe saw so many of our friends along the way, like Moses Zapien, Gene Acevedo and many others. I was proud to be a part of our city's celebration of Latino culture and heritage.	10152142596518981
6553468980	On a run near Grupe Park, I saw 4 young men playing at the park’s handball courts.  I jogged over to them and we got to talking. They said they play every afternoon till sunset.

6553468980	Day 8 and Boehner continues to refuse to negotiate.  His proposed “supercommittee” would actually prohibit discussion of closing tax loopholes to get our country’s fiscal affairs in order.  Just more obstructionism while countless Americans are being denied access to services they count on.  It’s time to end the #GOPShutdown and get back to work.	10151717653803981
6553468980	Today marks the 123rd anniversary of Yosemite National Park.  Thanks to the GOP shut down of government, no one will be able to enjoy this state and national treasure today.	10151704427513981
6553468980	We're heading towards a shutdown of the government tonight because the House GOP can’t get their way and will bring the government down to satisfy the Tea Party.  They are holding the American people and our country's business hostage. I know you're frustrated, and I am too.  This is inexcusable.	10151702976773981
6553468980	Only three days away from the federal government shutting down thanks to the game-playing and obstructionism of the House GOP.  They are playing these games with people’s livelihoods and services they count on.  This is unacceptable.	10151696473063981
6553468980	Will the House GOP stop playing games and avoid a government shutdown?  Seems that their leadership has lost control to the Tea Party.	10151693461183981

133714040028137	The top priority of Congress is to ensure the safety of the American people. Today’s vote to fund #DHS ensures that our homeland security agents and personnel have the certainty and long term funding necessary to do their critical work of keeping us all safe. I do not support the President’s unilateral executive action on immigration as it flies in the face of the United States Constitution and ignores the will of the people. However, we cannot hold hostage funding for our national security and I will continue to push for a full debate on every aspect of immigration reform.	849982545067946

133714040028137	I along with our community have lost a great friend in the passing of Dave Geer. His public service went well beyond his contributions on the Modesto City Council. Dave was dedicated to improving the lives of many in our county as well as shaping politics at the state and federal levels. My prayers are with Dave's family, and he will be sorely missed.	813919805340887

133714040028137	This afternoon I voted for the Honoring the Families of Fallen Soldiers Act and the Flight Safety Act. The first provides continued payment of final expenses to the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. The second funds the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) so that people across the country can continue to travel in safety. I was encouraged to see 197 Democrats join us in voting to provide security for the families of fallen soldiers. I hope we can continue to find areas of agreement as we work to end the shutdown. We must begin by working together, and that means the President and Senate Democrats must come to the table to negotiate with us. I stand ready and willing to talk to any member across the aisle to find ways to end this shutdown – it should never have happened in the first place. \n\nSince the shutdown began, I have also voted to reopen the NIH and ensure that all patients have access to clinical trials; ensure that our National Guard and reservists are paid; fund veterans’ benefits through the VA; reopen our national parks; allow the District of Columbia to expend their local funds; provide funding for FEMA; fund nutritional assistance for women and children in need; provide compensation for furloughed federal employees, along with compensation for those federal employees who have  been deemed “essential” and continue working during shutdown; provide funding for the FDA; and fund Head Start programs.	584697494929787
133714040028137	The U.S. Treasury has predicted that we will hit our debt limit next week and that a default would be “catastrophic.” In 2008, President Obama said that adding trillions to our national debt was “unpatriotic.” I agree. Yet during his presidency, our national debt has increased by more than $6 trillion. And this morning, White House officials said that they would not negotiate with us in an attempt to force us to raise the debt limit. \n\nOur unrestrained spending must be stopped. That will take negotiation, and I will not support giving the administration a limitless credit card. We are putting our debt on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren, and they deserve better.	583733891692814
133714040028137	Tonight I voted on three funding bills - veterans affairs, national parks and the DC City government - and all three failed to pass due to a lack of democrat support in the House. \nMany of you are commenting about the ACA and none of the three bills had anything to do Obamacare, yet they still failed to pass. \nI was elected to not only represent the people of my district, but also be a good steward of America's future, which means not piling on trillions in debt for our children and grandchildren. \nI agreed with then senator Obama in 2008 who said adding more debt to our then $9 Trillion problem was un-patriotic. We are now at over $17 Trillion in debt.  The spending madness has to stop.  \nI'm willing to address the reality of this problem with anyone who wants to work, but having an unlimited credit card for spending is a none starter for me. \nRecommendations and solutions welcomed.	580905425308994
133714040028137	On Saturday I voted to keep our government running through December 15, 2013. My vote gives certainty to businesses and hardworking families across the country that deserve the reliability of a working government, and the impetus is now on the Senate to act today to avert shutdown. \n\nThe implementation process of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has revealed problem after problem with the law, stymied job creation and slowed economic growth. We need to replace it with a fiscally responsible solution that puts patients first. I supported an amendment on Saturday to delay the ACA by one year and permanently repeal the law’s medical device tax. I also voted to make sure that our troops are paid no matter what.	580291895370347
133714040028137	Last week, I voted to continue funding the government through December 15, 2013. The funding bill I supported is a responsible solution that protects members of the military, seniors, veterans and local law enforcement officials. The impetus is now on the Senate to act to avert a government shutdown. I hope that they will follow the House's lead in taking action to give certainty to businesses and hardworking families across the country and ensure our government keeps functioning.\n\nThe bill I supported includes language to defund the Affordable Care Act. Many of you have shared with me your fears and concerns about the impact the law will have on your families and your businesses. I believe we need a fiscally responsibly healthcare plan with common sense initiatives to lower healthcare costs without reducing benefits or restricting choices, and the Affordable Care Act is not that plan. \n\nMost importantly, I will continue to work to reign in wasteful government inefficiency and end our out-of-control spending habits. Our current trajectory is unsustainable and irresponsible, and unless we adopt more restrained fiscal habits, we will continue to burden our children and grandchildren with our debt.	577371718995698

75298637905	This weekend more than 213,000 Californians looking to get back to work - including 5,500 right here in Contra Costa - had their unemployment insurance cut off during the holiday season because Congress failed to act. It will be a top priority for Democrats in Congress next year to make sure we extend unemployment insurance for folks stuggling to make ends meet in a tough economy.

75298637905	Americans came together 12 years ago despite our differences to face a horrific challenge. Today, we remember the victims and honor all those who responded to save lives and protect our country. America is strongest when we serve one another and dedicate ourselves to the values that make our country great – freedom of thought, equality, and economic opportunity for all.  The test for us now is not only how we try to prevent or respond to future crises but also whether we will finally come together to govern this nation responsibly in the best interests of everyday Americans.	10151789993397906

75298637905	The President has wisely chosen to seek approval from Congress for any possible military action in Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons. I joined many of my colleagues in recent days in calling on the President to seek authorization from Congress for any military action. I do not know what the President will ask for from Congress in the days ahead, or whether or not I will support his request. I will, of course, give his request the sober and thorough consideration that it deserves. \n\nBut one thing I will not support is any request for an open-ended or unlimited American military action in Syria. Like most Americans, I am wary of getting America involved in yet another war. I will weigh this concern against the very serious concern I share with the President over the use of chemical weapons in violation of the Chemical Weapons Ban Treaty.	10151767578827906

75298637905	I am encouraged to see President Obama and a bipartisan group of Senators independently announce broad plans for moving forward with comprehensive immigration reform.  It is a positive sign that there is bipartisan collaboration in both houses, and an early commitment from the President in his second term.  \n\nFor a comprehensive proposal to be successful, it must strengthen our borders, crack down on companies that hire undocumented workers or abuse guest worker programs, provide a fair and honest path to citizenship for millions of immigrants, and streamline our legal immigration system to attract the best minds to America, rather than ceding their skills to other countries. It is time to fix our broken immigration system and I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues in Congress to do so.	10151342351887906
75298637905	Tonight in Congress the important art of compromise was revived, an art that had been stifled since the Tea Party took over the House two years ago. I voted for the bi-partisan compromise fiscal cliff agreement to prevent a tax hike on the middle class, to increase tax rates on the wealthiest, and to continue unemployment insurance, tax credits for low-income families and small businesses, and investments in renewable energy. Not a perfect deal, clearly, but a solid agreement that paves the way for important, although, difficult decisions in the next few months ahead.	10151291776037906
75298637905	Just left briefing with VP Biden on Fiscal Cliff and am waiting now for Republicans to announce whether or not the House will vote on the bi-partisan bill the Senate passed 89-8. I support the agreement. It is not perfect but it is a very solid compromise that protects middle class families, seniors, the poor, education, and renewable energy production, and it makes the tax code fairer. Still difficult decisions to come, but this is a solid agreement to protect the middle class from a tax hike and to have the wealthiest pay a fairer share.	10151291109972906
75298637905	In D.C. today - heard from so many of you about your concerns about Boehner's plan B - which would cut programs and still allow for the wealthiest to have a tax break.

75298637905	I join President Obama and my colleagues in Congress in expressing heartfelt sadness over the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens, Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith, and two other Americans in a violent attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya and in condemning this attack in the strongest possible terms. My prayers are for the families and friends of each of those who were killed in this reprehensible attack. This tragedy is a reminder of the enormous risks Americans serving our country take every day in the effort to advance justice and Democracy overseas.  Let’s be clear -- there is no justification whatsoever for these attacks.  Now is the time for all Americans to demonstrate our unity in opposing attacks on our diplomatic staff and in working together to protect them. And I urge people in this country and abroad to join in rejecting senseless violence and hatred and to instead pursue their goals through peaceful means.	10151124986177906

Huge victory for the American people, small businesses, women, children, and seniors. \n\nNow, the threat that remains to your continued access to affordable health care and to the Medicare guarantee is from the Republican Congress and candidate Mitt Romney who have pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act that the Supreme Court just ruled is constitutional.  Remember what Speaker Boehner said yesterday:  “If the court does not strike down the entire law, the House will move to repeal what’s left of it.”  I will fight to protect your health care.	10150971359977906
75298637905	Just 10 days remain before student loan interest rates double. Democrats just voted (again) to keep the rates low by ending subsidies to big oil companies. But not a single Republican joined our vote. We need to stop the student loan interest rate hike to protect middle class and low-income college students, and we need to act quickly.	10150954340502906
75298637905	Great news today for DREAMers. President Obama just announced that hundreds of thousands of students who were brought to this country will no longer face the threat of deportation – these are young people who go to school or join the military, and don’t pose a threat to public safety. These kids have worked hard, and we should give them the chance to pursue the American Dream. I’ve long supported the DREAM Act and am glad to see President Obama taking this step.	10150943994032906

Exide operated in Vernon for many years without a proper permit.  The Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) will host a public scoping meeting tomorrow to present a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR), which outlines plans for Exide’s closure process and potential environmental impacts resulting from those closure activities.  Please see the flyer for further details, and share this news with friends, neighbors, and other community members to encourage them to attend.\n\nLe urjo a todos los residentes de las ciudades del sureste de Los Angeles a que participen en una junta mañana 18 de junio a las 6:00pm en el Ayuntamiento de Maywood en relación al cierre de la planta de reciclaje de baterías de plomo, Exide.

139773069370563	At today's Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee markup, I introduced an amendment to restore funding to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  It makes no sense to wipe out this unique and vital agency.  No other HHS agency shares AHRQ’s mission: #AHRQ is our only federal agency focused on researching and sharing evidence-based information that can be used to increase the quality and safety of American health services, and make our health care more accessible, equitable, and cost-efficient.  AHRQ’s funding represents only 0.01% of all health care spending, but this small investment has huge returns for the American people, promoting better health outcomes and practices that make us healthier and improve the quality of care we receive.\n \nI am deeply disappointed that AHRQ’s funding was eliminated, and that my amendment to restore this funding was voted down by the Majority today.  I continue to believe we must restore AHRQ's funding without delay.  #SaveAHRQ	1108194395861754
139773069370563	I had the pleasure of congratulating California Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de León on his receipt of the "CREO" Award from The East Los Angeles Community Union (TELACU) during the TELACU Education Foundation's 32nd Annual Building The Dream Gala.  I fight hard in Congress to strengthen the 40th District's communities and help our students meet their full academic potential, and TELACU and its Education Foundation have been invaluable local partners in those fights.  Thanks to everyone at TELACU (including the Lizárraga family) for your work to help communities and students in need, and congratulations to TELACU's scholarship winners!	1099982303349630
139773069370563	The U.S. Export-Import Bank helps small businesses in our District and across America finance their exports of goods and services.  40th District businesses benefit from nearly a million dollars in Export-Import Bank support, helping them to create jobs and compete in the global market.  That is why it is critical for Congress to renew the bank's charter before it expires at the end of June.  Unfortunately, House Republican leaders are refusing to renew it.  Let's do so today, so that the Export-Import Bank can keep supporting jobs and small businesses across the country!  #ExIm4Jobs	1098780406803153

139773069370563	Met yesterday with Dr. Huban Gowadia, the Director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO).  I appreciated the opportunity to speak with Dr. Gowadia about DNDO’s work to protect Los Angeles – and America at large – from nuclear terrorism.  Later, I joined Mayor Eric Garcetti and Rep. Ted Lieu for a DNDO demonstration of nuclear detection equipment.  We also participated in a discussion of DNDO’s Securing the Cities program, which partners with state, local, and tribal agencies to detect, report, and respond to nuclear and radiological dangers in major metropolitan areas, including the Los Angeles/Long Beach region.  As the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I am committed to ensuring that our law enforcement personnel have the resources they need to protect America from nuclear and radiological threats.	1096249533722907
139773069370563	Led my annual hospital and clinic roundtables with health care leaders from across our district and beyond!  I was very glad to see a robust turnout at both events.  We had productive and insightful discussions about the Medicaid 1115 Waiver Renewal, behavioral health integration into primary care, and workforce concerns, among many other issues.  I especially want to thank Melissa Stafford Jones, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Region IX Director; Mari Cantwell, California's Chief Deputy Director of Health Care Programs; and Alexander Li, the LA County Department of Health Services’ Deputy Director of Care Transitions, for serving as panelists at both roundtables.	1095852420429285

139773069370563	Today, I led more than 130 House Democrats in writing a letter to Homeland Security Sec. Jeh Johnson expressing our strong concerns about our #FamilyDetention facilities, and urging an end to the use of family detention.  These facilities hold immigrant mothers and children in jail-like conditions, which can be deeply harmful to their health and development.  You can read our letter at https://lofgren.house.gov/uploadedfiles/family_detention.pdf.	1095370807144113
139773069370563	I am disappointed in Tuesday's ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which continues to block President Obama's legal authority for expansion of #DACA and implementation of #DAPA. \n\nPresident Obama's actions would allow millions of our neighbors, friends, and family members who are contributing to our communities and pose no national security threat to continue living and working in the United States without fear of deportation.  That is not only the right thing to do, but also in the best interest of our country.\n\nWe should allow immigrant families who live and work here to continue contributing to our economy.  At the same time, we should focus America's immigration enforcement resources on the removal of serious criminals and national security threats.\n\nAbsent the passage of comprehensive #immigration reform, our communities will continue to suffer from many of the devastating effects of deportation and family separation. The President's executive actions are a significant step in the right direction.  I am optimistic that the Administration’s appeal will ultimately succeed, and that this lawsuit will be settled in favor of our immigrant families and youth.	1095365453811315
139773069370563	Honored our nation’s fallen heroes at Memorial Day events in and around the 40th District.  Because these patriots were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedom, Americans have enjoyed the blessings of peace and liberty, and the freedom to speak and worship freely, to assemble without fear, and to pursue our dreams.\n\nWe will always be grateful to the men and women we honor on Memorial Day. Let us remember that those who have sacrificed their lives serving our country did not die in vain. Let us pay tribute to their sacrifices through civic participation, through voting on election day, and through honoring the American values of freedom, equality, and justice in our hearts, in our minds, and in our actions. #MemorialDay	1094749300539597
139773069370563	Was honored to be at East LA's James A. Garfield High School to take part in the Army JROTC’s 72nd annual awards ceremony!  I congratulated the graduating cadets, who have demonstrated that they have the determination and passion to succeed in the JROTC program.  These cadets have excelled in a program that instills principles of leadership and prepares students to be the productive leaders of tomorrow.  They have become aware of their rights, responsibilities, and privileges as Americans.  Most importantly, they have been motivated to become better citizens.  As these cadets prepare to enter the real world, I am sure they will apply this program’s lessons to their new lives.	1093755477305646

139773069370563	Today would have been the first day of implementation of administrative relief for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, if it were not for a judicial injunction to stop this relief from taking effect.  That is why I am joining national, state, and local immigrant rights advocates today to continue the fight to implement President Obama’s recent immigration executive actions.\n \nThe President’s actions would extend the #DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program to cover more of the young people who entered the United States before the age of 16.  His actions would also establish the #DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) program, which would protect many parents of U.S. Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) from being deported and separated from their children.\n \nEvery day that the DACA expansion and DAPA are delayed, our families, communities, and businesses suffer.  I am confident the injunction will ultimately be lifted, allowing DAPA and the DACA expansion to take effect.\n \nIn the meantime, I remind those eligible for the current DACA program that they can still apply.  For information on the DACA process, requirements, and program renewal, visit http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca.\n \nThose eligible for DACA expansion and DAPA should also begin to prepare the information and documentation they will need to apply for these programs.  Find more details at http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction.\n\nHoy hubiese sido el primer día de la implementación de acción ejecutiva para padres de Estadounidenses y residentes permanentes legales, sino hubiese sido por un alto judicial. Es por eso que hoy me uno a grupos nacionales, estatales, y locales que abogan por derechos de los inmigrantes para continuar la lucha por la implementación de las recientes acciones ejecutivas del Presidente Obama.\n \nEstas acciones del Presidente extenderían el programa de #DACA para cubrir más de los jóvenes que entraron al país antes de los 16 años de edad. Estas acciones también establecerían el programa de #DAPA, que protegería de la deportación y prevendría la separación de familias.\n \nCada día que se retrasa DAPA y la expansión de DACA, nuestras familias, comunidades, y negocios sufren. Tengo confianza que la decisión del juez de ponerle un alto a estos programas no perdurará y los programas de DAPA y la expansión de DACA serán implementados.\n \nMientras tanto, les recuerdo a aquellos elegibles para el programa de DACA en efecto que pueden seguir aplicando. Para más información sobre este programa, el proceso y los requisitos pueden visitar: http://www.uscis.gov/es/acciondiferida\n \nAquellos elegibles para DAPA y la expansión de DACA también deben de prepararse de ante mano con la información y documentación necesaria.

139773069370563	The National Defense Authorization Act that passed the House today is bad for our country.  Not only does it lock in the harmful, across-the-board sequestration spending caps set forth in the Republican budget, it uses hypocritical gimmicks to avoid those very same caps – for defense spending, and only defense spending.  By funneling extra money to defense spending while squeezing funding in the rest of our nation’s budget, Republicans cripple our infrastructure, disadvantage our children, and hurt our economy.\n\nThe richest nation in the history of the world should not be forced to pick winners and losers in its budget battles.  It’s all about priorities.  And the majority’s priorities that shortchange job training, education, roads, and bridges are just plain wrong.\n\nTheir strategy of keeping the sequester even hurts the Defense Department, because while its operations are funded above sequester levels for the coming year, it has no such assurances for future years.  The Pentagon desperately needs long-term funding stability in order to plan and execute strategies to protect our nation from danger.\n\nI’m particularly disappointed that Republicans decided to strip out the bill’s language encouraging the Secretary of Defense to explore – just explore – the possibility of letting DREAMers join the military.  What does Republicans’ refusal to allow our Defense Secretary to even consider a given course of action say about their willingness to be reasonable and bipartisan legislators?\n\nThe President has said that he will veto this NDAA.  I support his decision.  Our military deserves far better than this irresponsible bill.	1089244234423437
139773069370563	As an original co-author of the DREAM Act, I proudly support Rep. Ruben Gallego's bipartisan effort to encourage the Secretary of Defense to let DREAMers serve in our military.  We should give young, DACA-eligible patriots the opportunity to defend America, the only land they love.\n\nUnfortunately, some of my House colleagues are supporting an amendment from Congressman Mo Brooks which would strip Congressman Gallego's policy from the National Defense Authorization Act.  I stand against the Brooks Amendment, and stand for Congressman Gallego's plan to strengthen our military, strengthen our nation, and offer DREAMers a new way to give back to the country they call home.	1088718797809314
139773069370563	Today, I joined Representative Zoe Lofgren and Congressman Luis V. Gutierrez to call on the Department of Homeland Security to end its family detention policy, after a new set of actions was announced by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n\nWe acknowledge that DHS is trying to address broad public disappointment with its policy of incarcerating vulnerable women and children. Unfortunately, today’s plan states that DHS will continue detaining women and children, and only consider methods of making the facilities better and more humane.\n\nThe United States government should not be in the business of holding mothers and children in detention, no matter how nice the facilities or how many stakeholder meetings the government has.  Jailing children and women is not the answer.  It is detrimental to child development, and can have serious and long-lasting impacts on the psychological health and well-being of these families.  Furthermore, we have learned of many women and children confined in detention centers who have severe medical needs, including intellectual disabilities, cancers, and various serious medical disorders. \n\nWe need to do the right thing, and we are confident that DHS can both honor our nation’s commitment to the well-being of children as well as our commitment to law enforcement and public safety.  The government should be releasing detainees on supervised or monitored release pending the disposition of their cases – not fighting the court orders, injunctions, and overwhelming evidence against family detention.	1088245744523286
139773069370563	Was proud to help lead a Congressional letter to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services expressing our concerns about this year's U.S. dietary guidelines, which are expected to recommend that Americans severely reduce their consumption of enriched grains.  Such a recommendation would ignore the substantial public health value of eating grains enriched with folic acid.  Since 1998, when the Food and Drug Administration mandated that enriched grains be fortified with folic acid, we've seen a 36% decrease in the incidence of American babies born with neural tube defects (NTDs) like spina bifida and anencephaly.\n\nWe must continue to build on this progress, because there is still more work to be done to bring enriched grains to the American people, especially Latinos.  There is often no folic acid enrichment in the products available in predominantly Latino communities.  As a result, Latino mothers are 1.5 to 3 times more likely to have a baby with an NTD.\n\nThe health benefits of folic acid-enriched grains are clear.  For the sake of our newborns and our mothers, I hope our government's final 2015 dietary recommendations will encourage more production and consumption of enriched grains for all Americans.	1087808684566992

262447300551014	The news coming out of Charleston is absolutely devastating. Such a despicable act of violence taking place in a house of worship is sickening. My heart aches for the victims and their families, and I am keeping them in my thoughts and prayers.	690716397724100
262447300551014	WARNING! Wonky update below. Yesterday, House Republicans approved a procedural vote, which will allow them to proceed on a package of trade bills. Here is a quick breakdown of the bills, what they do, and why they’re coming up for a vote:\n \nTrade Adjustment Authority (TAA): TAA is intended to provide assistance to workers who lost their jobs due to trade agreements. Republicans offered TAA in an attempt to get Democrats on board with the trade deal but then inserted language that would pay for TAA by cutting Medicare. Leadership inserted the cuts to Medicare in an attempt to shore up conservative support in their party who have reservations about providing assistance to displaced workers. However, because of the Medicare cuts, Democrats who were in favor of TAA in the past have largely pulled their support.\n \nTrade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act : In an effort to get Democrats back on board, the Republican leadership has inserted language into this legislation that says TAA will not be paid for by Medicare cuts, but rather strengthened tax compliance laws.\n \nTrade Promotional Authority (TPA): Also known as “Fast Track”, TPA grants authority to the President to negotiate trade agreements and limits what Congress can do. If TPA is approved, Congress could only give the trade agreements an up or down vote and would not be able to amend it or filibuster it.\n \nAs you can see, members of the Republican leadership are twisting themselves into knots trying to get support for TPA. I believe that TPP must be declassified for the public, debated by Congress and amended. Too often, trade bills such as these harm working families the most, and I’ll be voting against each and every one of them!	687952744667132
262447300551014	Earlier tonight, I voted against the repeal of the Country of Origins Labeling Act (also known as the COOL Act). By repealing this legislation, Congress could leave Americans in the dark as to whether or not certain food products were from other nations.\n\nI believe that consumers deserve to know where their food is coming from and repealing the COOL Act is incredibly misguided.	687462438049496
262447300551014	Sending my thoughts and prayers to those who were on the Amtrak 188 train the derailed last night in Philadelphia. I hope the investigation is conducted swiftly so that we can find out what went wrong and ensure that it never happens again.	674504816011925
262447300551014	I’m proud to see my Democratic colleagues in the Senate stand up to the special interests looking to fast track the new free trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, also known as TPP. Free trade agreements in the past have decimated working class populations and any new trade agreement must be declassified and undergo scrutiny from Congress and the public at large. Only then would we be able to ensure that American workers are not losing out.	674202156042191

262447300551014	The budget passed by House Republicans today once again shows their commitment to ending Medicare as we know it, gutting education programs, repealing Obamacare, and increasing taxes on middle class families in order to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. Upon winning the majority in the Senate in last year’s midterm elections, Speaker Boehner vowed that Congress would practice good governance, not political theater. This budget breaks that vow.\n\nBy attempting to repeal Obamacare in its entirety, this budget will kick more than 16 million people off their health insurance and allow health insurance companies to once again write the rules. That cannot and will not happen.\n\nIf we wish to continue our recovery, and not harm the middle class, our budget should reflect their priorities by investing in small businesses, education, infrastructure, and job training, and strengthening our safety net. Only then will Speaker Boehner live up to his vow of practicing good governance.	652767998185607

262447300551014	Today's events show the depth of the dysfunction within the Republican Party and the extent to which they'll go to oppose any type of immigration reform. To take our Department of Homeland Security to the brink of a shutdown is irresponsible and puts our country at risk. With that said, I voted in favor of a one week funding for the sole purpose of allowing Speaker Boehner to organize his caucus and put forth a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill for the rest of the fiscal year. Anything less would be a gross violation of our duty to protect this nation.	638888582906882

262447300551014	Last night, two days before applications were to be accepted, a federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush blocked President Obama’s executive action on immigration. \n\nThis ruling is misguided and wrong. The Department of Homeland Security and various immigration agencies have discretion as to who to target for deportation, and President Obama’s executive action simply prioritizes criminals over families. \n\nI urge the Department of Justice to appeal as soon as possible, as I fully expect this ruling to be overturned.	634429710019436
262447300551014	The President’s proposed Authorization for Use of Military Force is deliberate, carefully crafted, and very much needed, as the 2001 and 2002 authorizations are outdated and no longer apply to the current situation in the Middle East. I applaud the President for seeking to reform and eventually end these AUMFs.\n \nThis new authorization presents Congress with an opportunity to have a full and proper debate about our role in confronting ISIS. I have long been wary of an impulsive strategy that would drag our country into another prolonged conflict, and I’m pleased to see that the President’s proposal is limited to three years. Also, the AUMF appears to limit the use of ground troops, but I am concerned about the vague nature of the language. I hope that during our debate, Congress will address this issue and give it some much-needed clarity.\n \nAfter spending trillions of dollars on a decade of war, the United States cannot and should not shoulder the entire burden of this operation. A coalition of Middle East and European allies is necessary to confront and defeat this sickening group. They are a plague to the entire world, and the sooner Congress acts on an AUMF, the sooner we can defeat ISIS.	631979070264500

262447300551014	Tonight, we heard from President Obama on the state of our union and his vision for the next year. During his speech, the President laid out a bold plan, one that focuses on the ideals of our great nation – including fairness for working and middle class families and our immigrant communities. \n\nBy focusing his economic proposals on the middle class, President Obama has made it clear that no longer should the wealthiest in our nation be granted special tax benefits simply because of the size of their pocketbooks. The President also made a strong defense of his executive action on immigration, which has benefited millions of people, such as my State of the Union guest Italia Garcia, who is a local DREAM activist. Italia and her family, like many others, are not a drain on our nation. They enhance this great country through their hard work and dedication. They are as American as anyone else and any attempt to undermine the President’s action without passing comprehensive immigration reform would separate these families and hurt our economy. \n\nWhile President Obama is facing a Republican-controlled Congress for the first time in his Presidency, I am confident that he and the Republicans can find common ground on the issues that matter most to the American people – the economy, immigration reform, education, fixing our VA, and national security. Finding and acting on these issues will undoubtedly help the American people regain their faith in our system and I look forward to working together throughout this year.	622236544572086
262447300551014	Early reports are suggesting that during his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, President Obama will propose a massive tax cut for working and middle class families that will be paid for by closing loopholes frequently used by the top .01%.\n\nWhile the final details have yet to be released, I would support such any proposal that gives tax cuts to working and middle class Americans. Would you?	621056421356765

262447300551014	I’m pleased that the Administration has taken steps to normalize relations with #Cuba. For more than 50 years, we have engaged in a foreign relations policy that was ineffective and misguided. In order to promote democracy in Cuba and alleviate the suffering of its citizens, the United States should be engaging the Cuban people, creating a presence on the island through travel and an embassy, and promoting economic development. These types of policies have worked for decades in many other nations and this course correction, which is a long time coming, will undoubtedly yield the same results and benefit our nation.	603487609780313

117483585008	This weekend, I will travel to my hometown of St. Louis, Missouri to attend the funeral of Michael Brown on Monday. I am particularly sympathetic to the parents and relatives of Michael Brown for their loss, and am unsettled over the circumstances of his death. I was reared in St. Louis, Missouri, attended elementary school and was a graduate of Vashon High School. Still today, I have many family members in St. Louis and recently buried my mother there, Velma Carr Moore, a longtime resident of St. Louis. \n\nI have closely followed the daily reports regarding the circumstances of Michael Brown’s death and have paid close attention to eyewitness accounts of the shooting. I have also continued to watch  the televised protests that have been going on for the past 13 days in Ferguson. I am reminded of the police shootings that have taken place in the Los Angeles area, and the role I played in attempting to articulate the pain and hopelessness of the people of South Los Angeles following the Rodney King beating by L.A. police officers. \n\nI have been in contact with some of the elected officials and community leaders in the St. Louis area and join with the overall community in calling for justice for Michael Brown. My presence at the funeral will afford me the opportunity to personally share my condolences with the family. While I am in St. Louis, I will meet with local leaders and offer my assistance in future organizing to help create change in the Ferguson community.	10152250470100009

Social Security has been a stable and secure source of income for millions of seniors and families, many of whom desperately need it, over these last more than seven decades. It also benefits state economies and local businesses all across the country. We must continue to preserve Social Security and safeguard the rights of our nation’s seniors.	10152235740235009
117483585008	I am deeply concerned about the situation in Iraq, and my heart goes out to the Iraqi civilians who have been injured or killed and the displaced families who have been forced to flee their homes. Despite our humanitarian concerns, the United States cannot solve all international crises, and the future of Iraq should be in the hands of its people. \n\nI voted against the Iraq war authorization in the first place in 2002, and formed the Out of Iraq Caucus to bring to the House of Representatives an ongoing debate about the war in Iraq and urge the return of U.S. service members to their families. \n\nWe were at war in Iraq for eight years and nearly 4,500 of our men and women in uniform lost their lives. Tens of thousands more came back wounded or injured, and their lives were changed forever. The cost of the war is estimated at $815 billion, of which $20 billion alone was invested to train Iraqi security forces to defend themselves and their country. \n\nThe American people are war-weary and not interested in another prolonged military effort in Iraq. I will continue to closely monitor the situation, but every conceivable effort must be made in working with the international community to negotiate peace, not a return to war.	10152131305585009

117483585008	I was proud to celebrate the groundbreaking of the Crenshaw/LAX Transit Corridor today, for which I worked tirelessly to secure federal support. The federal government is expected to provide approximately $160 million for the project, as well as a $546 million loan, which will be repaid with local funds. This corridor will provide service to several communities in and around my district in both the cities of Los Angeles and Inglewood, and it will give residents access to work, school, shopping, entertainment, and everything else Los Angeles has to offer.	10151863577295009
117483585008	I am elated that after months of uncertainty and obstruction, the U.S. Senate has finally confirmed Congressman Mel Watt to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency.The FHFA plays a critical role in our economic and housing recovery and the position of Director requires a leader who deeply understands the complex issues surrounding housing and housing finance. I believe Mel Watt has the vision, experience and temperament necessary to ensure the FHFA remains focused on the long-term stability of the economy and the housing finance system.	10151783960835009
117483585008	I am honored to be a part of the official Congressional Delegation traveling to Johannesburg, South Africa to attend Tuesday's memorial service for my friend and extraordinary leader, President Nelson Mandela. This memorial service will give my colleagues and I, as well as people around the world, an opportunity to pay final respects to one of the greatest icons that ever lived.	10151780192360009
117483585008	I hope everyone is having a joyous and safe holiday. Happy Thanksgiving from my family to yours!	10151757368675009
117483585008	I stand ready and willing to assist our government’s response to alleviate suffering for the people of the Philippines affected by Typhoon Haiyan. I am encouraged that the United States government is already providing humanitarian assistance. In my district, there are estimated to be over 21,000 Filipino-Americans who greatly contribute to the multicultural fabric that makes the Los Angeles area a great place to live. I look forward to working with the Filipino-American community to ensure that water, food and other assistance gets to people in need and to help with the rescue efforts.	10151724508015009
117483585008	My thoughts and prayers are with the LAX shooting victims, their families and loved ones today. I pray for the health and recovery of those injured and for our first responders who arrived on the scene to tend to the wounded and secure the area inside the terminal.\n\nLAX is located in my congressional district, and it is the sixth busiest airport in the world and third in the United States. The TSA security checkpoints are the public’s first line of defense against weapons and contraband being brought into our nation's airports. The safety and security of the people who work in and pass through LAX is of paramount importance.\n\nAs our law enforcement officials continue to investigate, it is my sincere hope that the individual or individuals responsible be held accountable and brought to justice for this heinous act.	10151696058300009
117483585008	I’m pleased that Congress has finally voted to end this unnecessary government shutdown and debt limit crisis. However, I remain concerned that the resolution passed today only opens the government and extends the debt ceiling for a precious few months. The resolution extends the continuing resolution through January 15 and suspends the debt limit until February 7. We in Congress cannot again disrupt people’s lives in this manner. The government shutdown caused financial hardship for hundreds of thousands of workers and their families. Our country cannot afford another event of this magnitude.	10151662807130009
117483585008	Today, a bill I co-sponsored unanimously passed the House of Representatives ensuring that all furloughed federal employees receive back pay. I also joined 199 Democratic colleagues in a letter to Speaker John Boehner calling for a vote on the clean Senate-passed continuing resolution to reopen the government. The American people have had enough and this shutdown could end today if a vote was simply allowed on this bill.	10151643140355009
117483585008	I am saddened that ideological extremism has led to another self-inflicted wound that could have dire consequences for our fragile economy. Even a short shutdown will threaten job creation, harm small businesses, and leave families with uncertainty and instability. Republicans are gambling with the American economy to make an ideological point. Each day this shutdown continues risks further irreparable damage to our financial system, our economy and our middle class. It must end now.	10151636080100009
117483585008	My thoughts & prayers are with the victims, their families, the first responders and all those affected by the Navy Yard shooting in D.C. this morning.	10151607774645009

117483585008	Today, I reintroduced a bill that would eliminate mandatory minimums from federal law. Mandatory minimum sentences have not reduced drug use and have contributed to exploding prison populations. The Major Drug Trafficking Prosecution Act of 2013 would re-focus federal resources to prosecute major drug kingpins and give courts and judges the authority to use greater discretion to make individualized determinations rather than being held to a stringent sentencing requirement prescribed by Congress.	10151601196960009
117483585008	I am very pleased with Attorney General Holder’s announcement today that federal prosecutors will no longer pursue mandatory minimum prison sentences in cases involving low-level, non-violent drug offenders who have no ties to large-scale gangs & cartels. I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues as we continue our joint efforts to reform the criminal justice system & focus federal resources on major drug traffickers.	10151547230820009
117483585008	I am disappointed with the verdict in the State of Florida vs. George Zimmerman case. My heart goes out to Trayvon Martin’s parents and the struggle that they have endured in an attempt to achieve justice for their son. Like many across the country, I do not believe that justice has been served. I join the NAACP and others in urging the Department of Justice to review the case and determine whether criminal civil rights charges can be pursued.	10151498552405009
117483585008	President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law 50 years ago today. Unfortunately, our fight for equal pay for equal work is not yet complete. Women still earn just 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. On this important anniversary, let us all recommit to work together until we have achieved an America where women are truly paid equal pay for equal work.	10151441712345009

117483585008	I'm proud to co-sponsor the Fair Minimum Wage Act to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 over the next three years, hike the tipped minimum wage, and tie future annual increases to the rate of inflation. With income inequality and productivity on the rise, it is long past time to give minimum wage workers a pay raise.	10151303419830009
117483585008	This morning, I will be joining Stephanie Miller Show on Current at 9:35am ET and Thomas Roberts on msnbc around 11:30am ET to discuss President Obama's State of the Union address. Tune in.	10151268739755009
117483585008	Earlier today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization bill by a bipartisan vote of 78 to 22. It has been 501 days since House Republicans allowed VAWA to expire. I urge the House GOP leadership to quickly bring this bill to the floor and allow a vote. The victims of domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault should not have to wait any longer.	10151267521870009

256471267712118	My family is with me in Washington this week and today I showed them around the Capitol building! \n\nMy granddaughter, Brooklyn, asked to see the statue of Rosa Parks in statuary hall. It is the first statue of an African American woman ever featured in the Capitol (and it was made by a San Pedro artist!)\n\nMore pictures to come... :)	1214289281930307
256471267712118	A delegation of World War II Merchant Marine Veterans are "Storming the Hill" this week to advocate for passage of my legislation, HR 563, which would finally provide these brave men just compensation for their service. \n\nThey faced enemy fire. In fact the casualty rate among Merchant Mariners was higher than any branch of the military -- but they were not eligible for benefits under the GI Bill.\n\nIt is impossible to hear their stories of courage and patriotism and not feel for yourself the pain and hurt they have suffered from the injustices this country has put them through.  My legislation would provide each of the surviving WWII Merchant Mariners with $25,000 in payment for their service and long overdue recognition for their sacrifice. \n\nClick through to read more about their stories.	1213748491984386
256471267712118	I’m rehearsing for tonight’s performance of “Will on the Hill”, a fun annual event in which members of Congress, journalists and a few professional actors (including this year Samira Wiley from Orange Is the New Black) poke fun at Washington.  It’s a lot of fun and for a good cause, helping support the Shakespeare Theatre Company’s education and community engagement programs to reach and inspire new and diverse audiences. Tonight’s show takes place at STC’s beautiful Sidney Harman Hall. #OITNB	1213032298722672
256471267712118	I am at the grand reopening of the Ramona Estates and Logan Plaza housing complex in Compton. Ramona Estates actually gets its name from my mother, Ramona Hahn, who was so devoted to this community and serves as housing for low-income seniors in an area where affordable housing is still too hard to find. The renovation and today’s grand opening are just the latest efforts of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee, which this year celebrates its fiftieth anniversary and its development arm, Greater Watts Development Corporation.	1199602216732347
256471267712118	Congratulations to the new graduates of the LA Harbor Occupational Center! Harbor Occupational offers programs for students of all walks of life to improve their lives and the lives of their families. Whether they are studying to earn their high school diploma, learning English as a second language, or getting technical career training, this school provides valuable education opportunities for people across the harbor area.\n\nI was thrilled to congratulate these students on the stage of the Warner Grand as they received their diplomas. Their hard work is paying off!	1198978673461368
256471267712118	Yesterday, two judges of the Fifth Circuit decided to continue the hold placed on President Obama’s executive actions on immigration, blocking relief for hard-working immigrant families in my district and across the country.  \n\nI know that this decision comes as a disappointment to many who are desperate to see these reforms begin to patch the holes in our broken immigration system, but I am hopeful that this is just a temporary setback. The President was well within his constitutional authority to take necessary steps to provide relief to suffering families. \n\nIt is long past time that we as a nation live up to the ideals and values that made our nation great.	1198348100191092
256471267712118	Congratulations to the ILWU whose members have just ratified a five year contract agreement with the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), ending months of uncertainty and ensuring a secure future for our ports and port workers.   We all benefit – workers, businesses, and consumers – from having our ports operating smoothly and keeping cargo moving. With this contract,the men & women who work in our docks and their families can rest easy, and we can have confidence that our local ports will remain the best and busiest in the nation.	1195564590469443
256471267712118	It's Foster Youth Shadow Day in Congress and I am excited to have Trayvonna from Los Angeles joining me at work today.  \n\nThis morning, we got to know each other on the bus ride to the Women's Memorial at Arlington Cemetery for a special event honoring women who have served our country. We laid roses at the reflecting pool in memory of fallen soldiers and I was happy to introduce Trayvonna to Senior Chief Phadra Hooker.  \n\nStay tuned for more updates on Trayvonna's day in Congress!	1193629663996269
256471267712118	My thoughts and prayers are with the passengers and families who lost loved ones in the Amtrak train crash in Philadelphia and I am thankful for the hard work and bravery of the first responders who worked to save lives on the scene. As a member of the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee, I am committed to learning what caused this derailment, preventing future accidents and keeping rail passengers safe. Without yet knowing the cause of the derailment, it is clear our infrastructure is woefully underfunded and in great need of improvement and investment.	1189065637786005
256471267712118	The Wilmington Family Health Center has now re-opened after undergoing extensive upgrades. The upgrades were made possible by a federal grant from the Department of Health and Human Services that I was proud to support. Now, the clinic is expected to double its annual service to 60,000 patients a year! It is one of 12 North East Community Clinics (NECC) facilities throughout Los Angeles County which provide health care to all regardless of their ability to pay.   Their services are so important to the health of the Wilmington community and I was proud to be apart of this important event.	1185378421488060
256471267712118	Yesterday I joined VA Secretary Robert McDonald, Mayor Garcetti,  Congressman Ted Lieu and Councilman Joe Buscaino at the ribbon cutting of the Blue Butterfly Village, a new housing complex for women veterans and their children in San Pedro. \n\nToo many of the men and women who volunteer to serve and defend us in our armed forces, who often risk their lives for us, return from overseas deployments and wind up trying to survive on the streets. The presence of Secretary McDonald in San Pedro is an indicator of the importance of the Blue Butterfly Village to the mission of ending veteran homelessness and addressing the needs of our brave female veterans.\n\nThis complex includes a U.S. Fish and Wildlife sanctuary for the Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly. It is my hope that the Blue Butterfly Village neighborhood will be not just a home but a sanctuary for these veterans and their families.	1184587364900499
256471267712118	Yesterday I joined the Palos Verdes Land Conservancy to celebrate Earth Day and replant native plants in the San Pedro sage brush.  I applaud the Conservancy staff and many volunteers who have worked to maintain our beautiful native ecosystems.\n\nThe Palos Verdes Land Conservancy offers the community a wonderful opportunity to appreciate the natural world around us and it inspires us to commit ourselves to advocating for the protection of our endangered species, for clean oceans and coastlines, and the continued battle against climate change.	1178516448840924

256471267712118	This morning, we named the North Long Beach Post Office after a very special person to our community, the late Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald. \n\nFrom her days in the California Assembly to serving in Congress, Juanita Millender-McDonald dedicated her career to advocating for the Los Angeles public school system, job training, women’s equality and women’s health, and combating the drug epidemic that was tearing apart her community. Juanita was an incredible woman and I hope that residents of Long Beach and surrounding communities who visit this post office will learn more about Juanita Millender-McDonald’s accomplishments and be inspired.\n\nhttp://hahn.house.gov/press-release/long-beach-ca%E2%80%94today-congresswoman-janice-hahn-ca-44-hosted-special-ceremony-renaming	1165364963489406
256471267712118	Yesterday I hosted SBA Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet in Carson and brought her to meet with a local small business owner in our community. Chinyere Ifeacho, an immigrant from Nigeria who owns and operates the Trinity African General Store, welcomed us to her store and told us a little bit about the challenges she has faced starting her business. \n\nOur nation’s economy is regaining its strength and we have our nation’s innovative small business owners to thank for it—many of whom are immigrants to this country. Immigrants are more than twice as likely to start a small business and their ingenuity and hard work mean economic growth and job creation in our communities. Immigrants like Chinyere Ifeacho risk their life savings in hopes of a more prosperous future and create opportunities for their families and their neighbors.	1162063180486251
256471267712118	It has been 30 years since we first signed the US-Israel Free Trade Agreement. This Free Trade Agreement was the first one of its kind between the United States and any other country, and by all measures it has been beneficial to both the U.S. and Israel.\nU.S. exports to Israel have increased more than five hundred percent since the Free Trade Agreement, putting Israel among our top twenty five trading partners, both for U.S. exports and imports.\n\nYesterday, I spoke at the Israel Trade Forum right here in San Pedro. We discussed the importance of this trade agreement to our port and to our local economy, and the enduring bond between our two countries.\n\nYes, from time to time like friends or family members, we might disagree, but nobody should doubt the commitment of the United States to Israel’s security. This important relationship between our nations will endure regardless of who the U.S. President is, who the Israeli Prime Minister is, or which party is in the majority in Congress.	1161515243874378
256471267712118	This morning my office held a special "pop-up" Congress on Your Corner at the Wilmington Food 4 Less.

256471267712118	I was honored to be recognized this weekend by SEIU Local 721's Women's Caucus with a 2015 Woman of Distinction Award. \n\nFrom Mother Jones to Dolores Huerta to SEIU President Mary Kay Henry – women have shaped the pathway forward for workers’ and women’s rights. I was proud to stand alongside strong women leaders who are fighting on behalf of women and minority workers and giving everyone a place at the table. #WomensHistoryMonth	1154956521196917
256471267712118	Today I voted against S.J. Res. 8, the Disapproval of the National Labor Relations Board Rule, which would have prevented our nation’s unions from holding fair and efficient elections.  For years, employers have had the ability to block union elections from taking place by freezing the process with endless litigation.  While most employers do not take such malicious actions, this important NLRB rule merely requires elections to be held in a reasonably timely manner. Everyone should agree that locking unions and employers into never-ending lawsuits to prevent elections from taking place is wrong and anti-American.  I stand with President Obama, a bipartisan coalition in the Senate, and workers around the country in opposing this anti-worker action by the House Republicans.  \n\nWorkers deserve a fair chance to vote on whether or not to form a union, and the NLRB rule protects workers’ right to make their voices heard.  Protecting workers’ rights helped build America’s middle class and benefits our economy.	1152255024800400
256471267712118	Today I joined the Long Beach Section of the National Council of Jewish Women to discuss the many obstacles facing young people pursuing higher education. \n\nThe American Dream, the promise of upward mobility, the hope that our hard work and sacrifices will provide our children and grandchildren with a higher standard of living… These are all very much in doubt now, at least for many Americans.\n\nStudents today face rising tuition costs and staggering debt while the government continues to profit off of high interest rates on federal student loans. Between predatory for-profit colleges and decreasing Pell Grants, there are many problems we need to address to make sure our young people can be prepared for success in our 21st century economy.	1149652415060661
256471267712118	Yesterday my granddaughter McKenna and I joined my congressional colleagues and President Obama at the Edmund Pettus Bridge to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. 50 years ago a brave group of civil rights advocates led by Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr.  marched across this bridge on their way to Montgomery to demand voting rights for African American citizens. But marchers were attacked at this bridge by Alabama state troopers.  The images of this brutality galvanized a national movement and the passage of the Voting Rights Act the following August.  \n\nIt has been incredible to be here with McKenna to honor this history and celebrate our nation's progress. But we know the march is not over. In 2013, the Supreme Court issued a ruling gutting the Voting Rights Act. In honor of the brave men and women who risked everything 50 years ago on this bridge, Congress must act to pass a revised and strengthened Voting Fights Act.  #Selma50	1144139212278648
256471267712118	Today my granddaughter McKenna and I are in Selma, Alabama at the Brown Chapel A.M.E Church for the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march on Selma.

90966961167	Memorial Day is part of the rich and expansive history of the United States. Every year, Americans take time out of their day to honor those who have died serving our country and protecting our freedom. This year, we pay our respects to the brave men and women who gave their lives in defense of our country. We salute them, and we keep their families close to our hearts this Memorial Day.\n\nIt is all too easy to get caught up in our everyday lives and forget about our troops overseas, but their sacrifices are what allow us to live freely. Though we can never fully repay them for all they have done, we can honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in protecting our country and freedoms. As soldiers return home, we must also renew our commitment to keep our solemn promises to the more than 2 million troops and reservists, their families, and 22 million veterans across our country. After all they have done for us, we must remember to thank our troops, our veterans, and their families not just on Memorial Day, but every day.\n\nIf you are a solider, veteran or military spouse and experiencing any difficulties obtaining your benefits, please do not hesitate to contact my office for assistance. Just as the military pledges to leave no soldier behind on the battlefield, we will leave no veteran behind when they return home.	10153272743151168

90966961167	Tonight the President gave a speech that was both inspirational and concrete. He reminded us of how far we've come in the past six years - from the brink of a depression to the fastest economic growth in over a decade - and how much we still must do. I look forward to discussing the details of his many proposals with the Administration and with my colleagues so that we can implement programs that strengthen the middle class.\n\nI will also thoroughly review the President’s request for a new Authorization for Use of Military Force. It is true that any further U.S. military action in Syria will require a clear and precise AUMF, but we must approach this with the utmost caution. We cannot wage another decade long war.\n\n#SOTU #StateoftheUnion	10152985186971168

Today we honor those who fought against incredible adversity to make this law a reality; today we stand by all seekers of justice who continue to speak up and act against discrimination in all forms.\n\nIn the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling rolling back key portions of the Voting Rights Act, we are reminded that the struggle for equality is not over. I call upon Members on both sides of the aisle to continue the bipartisan tradition of supporting civil rights and pass a renewed, revised, and strengthened Voting Rights Amendment Act to help America better live up to our creed that all people are created equal.	10152495641381168

90966961167	#TBT: Less than 10 years ago, a House Armed Services Subcommittee considered an amendment that would, in effect, remove women from serving in the military. Thankfully, the amendment never passed and last year the combat exclusion policy was lifted. \n\nBut after repeated errors, missed opportunities and cloaked bureaucracy by the military during this process, I have decided to take legislative action. \n\nMy "She is Ready Act," or SIR Act, removes artificial and arbitrary barriers for women entering combat positions and increases transparency during implementation.\n\nOur servicewomen want nothing more than to be seen and treated as equal while they risk their lives to protect our nation. I introduced this bill because I am grateful for their sacrifice and I refuse to let them down.\n\n#SheIsReadyAct \n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/18/AR2005051802094.html	10152350157351168

90966961167	Each year of his tenure, the President has put out a budget framework to address the many challenges we face as we climb out of the greatest recession since the great depression. This year is no different, and I am glad to see the outlines of how we can continue to grow our economy by expanding opportunity while maintaining fiscal discipline.\n\nI am particularly encouraged to see the clear effort to increase opportunity for the middle class and those working to join it. Cutting taxes for working Americans through the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and the American Opportunity Tax Credit - all proven tools that reduce poverty and help get people back to work - will be a boon to our economy. As a product of Head Start I know firsthand that the best way to close the achievement gap in high school is to close it in preschool, so I am also pleased to see the President’s focus on early childhood education. And the infrastructure plans included in the budget are middle-class job creators, economic drivers and investments that pay dividends into our future.\n\nAs a Blue Dog Democrat, I am glad the budget pledges to reduce our deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP by 2024 and stabilize our debt as a share of our economy by 2015. As we pull out of two wars, we must consider what our strategic and national security needs truly are. This budget reflects those needs, but does so in a fiscally responsible way.\n\nAs we continue to fully withdraw from Afghanistan this year, it is critical to protect funding for veterans not just this year but for the future, which is why I am happy to see that the budget secures funding not only in 2015, but also through 2016 advance appropriations for veteran medical care programs.  The budget also sets aside money to address veteran homelessness, a very serious but always underfunded issue, especially in Orange County.\n\nAs always, I look forward to reviewing the President’s budget framework line-by-line in the coming weeks.	10152226641331168
90966961167	The situation in Crimea is complex and rapidly changing. One thing is certain: Russia has violated international law and is walking down a dangerous path. \n\nI support the current efforts by the Administration, State Department, NATO and the G-7 to find a diplomatic solution to halt President Putin’s reckless behavior. Russia must respect the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and give the Ukrainian people the opportunity to determine their own future.\n\nAll response options need to remain on the table, but the United States should not take any action without the international community.	10152225011861168

392631677490897	Today marks the five-year remembrance of the BP Deepwater Horizon Gulf Oil disaster, one of the worst oil spills in our nation's history.  For 87 days, over four million barrels of oil discharged into the Gulf of Mexico, damaging nearly 1,000 miles of our coastline, beaches, marshes, and mangroves from Texas to Florida.  As the Administration looks to expand offshore drilling to frontier areas in the Atlantic and Artic we must consider the safety and environmental repercussions of these actions.	836987823055278

While it is incredibly painful to remember this tragedy and other similar intolerances we still face today, it is our dedication to educating future generations of this horror that will prevent future senseless acts of violence from occurring. Together, we must secure universal human rights for all people, as we assure that ‘never again’ means ‘never again’.	834809199939807
392631677490897	Twenty-six years ago today, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker struck the Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska which, as you may know, spilled around 11 million gallons of crude oil across nearly 1,300 miles of precious coastline.

Rabbi Shmuley attacked National Security Advisor Susan Rice claiming she is "blind to genocide" in Israel and Rwanda. Ms. Rice is a respected professional who has served her country proudly in numerous roles over the past two decades. This ad would be laughable if it was not so utterly offensive. I join with The American Jewish Committee ( AJC ) and the Anti-Defamation League  (ADL ) in condemning the ad. The friendship between the United States and Israel remains unshakable, regardless of such despicable and disparaging efforts."	810860629001331

392631677490897	Today in history: On February 3, 1870 the 15th Amendment of our Constitution, which prohibits voting discrimination on the basis of race, was ratified. Although this would not be fully recognized until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the ratification of the 15th amendment symbolizes a formative point in our history. Our nation is stronger when all voices in our communities are heard and everyone has a chance to participate in our electoral process, as the 15th Amendment states, the "right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." Regrettably, the Supreme Court's June 25, 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision is a huge setback for voting rights, and the U.S. Congress must respond to ensure that each American can enjoy the right to vote—free of discrimination.	796308470456547

392631677490897	An estimated 22 veterans commit suicide each day – more than 8,000 each year. It is estimated that roughly 600,000 service members, one-third of all the men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, have traumatic brain injury, PTSD or depression. Our brave service members have sacrificed greatly to protect this nation. Now we must honor our obligations to protect them. This is why I am proud to announce the House unanimously passed H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act which would expand access to and increase the effectiveness of mental health care for veterans. This is just the type of legislation we need to ensure that we keep our promises to our brave men and women in uniform.	785372891550105

392631677490897	While our hearts go out to the French people as they heal from their terrorist attack, let us also remember terrorism exists in other parts of the world.

It is time for these attacks to end, and we must do all we can to accomplish this goal.	784940954926632
392631677490897	47thFunFact: Do you know how the city of Signal Hill got its name? Rising to a height of 365 feet above Long Beach and twenty miles south of Los Angeles, many native tribes used the hilltop as a major signaling point to communicate with other tribes. Due to its sheer size and height these signals could be seen from other hills or boats within the area, a main location being Catalina Island, which as you know is just a little over 20 miles away. #SignalHill #CatalinaIsland #47thFunFact	783396595081068

392631677490897	Forty-four years ago today, President Richard Nixon signed into law the Clean Air Act of 1970. The implementation of this legislation marks a significant shift in our nation’s effort to ensure that the air we breathe is safe. Through the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) develops and enforces specific regulations to protect our communities from air pollution that could be hazardous to our health.

78476240421	Today I joined with most other Republicans in the House to accept a request by the Republican leadership that the vote on the appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security be put off for three weeks to give our leaders time to see if an agreement could be worked out with the Senate. House conservative Republicans, including me, insist that any DHS bill must include language that confronts President Obama's unconstitutional usurpation of legislative authority in acting and establishing a policy on how the federal government will deal with those who have come here illegally. This would let our leaders have three weeks to seek a solution that was acceptable to both the House and Senate, both of which now have GOP majorities. Three weeks was acceptable to me but not to about 50 GOP members who demanded action now, even if that means the DHS would be closed or thrown into a caretaker mode for lack of funding. All Democrats voted against the legislation providing for a three week Continuing Resolution. 53 Republicans joined their ranks preventing the three week bill from winning a majority, which is needed to pass the bill.\nHere is my rationale for voting to grant the leadership request for an extra three weeks:\n1. Things might happen to give us a better chance of accomplishing our goal if we had an extra three weeks\n2. There is no way we would end up in a worse spot after three weeks. The worst case was that we would be in exactly the same spot. So there was nothing to lose and maybe something to gain.\n3. There could be a court action or something that would directly impact the situation.\n4. There is a court order preventing Obama from any unauthorized actions with the illegals, thus for these three weeks Obama would not be taking unauthorized action with these illegal aliens. In the end the three week postponement was denied but a seven day extension was agreed to. We got nothing, but now our leadership has dramatically less time to try and find some common ground with the Senate. Several other prominent Constitutionalists like Tom McClintock joined with me giving the leadership a three week extension to find a way to achieve an acceptable compromise. In the end, whatever happens I will not be voting for a DHS Bill that does not at least partly address President Obama's violation of Constitutional requirements that he obey the laws and policies legislated by Congress.	10155279071430422

19463427992	Today, I voted to provide drought relief throughout California’s communities by maximizing the use of local water supplies. The House passed H.R. 5781, the California Emergency Drought Relief Act, to allow flexibility in water transfers, modify allocations and prioritize local water needs over federal water use.  I am proud to support a bill that increases access to vital water supplies, saves crops and addresses emergency conditions.	10152563210192993
19463427992	ISIS flourished after this Administration rushed away our assistance to Iraq, lost international credibility by not backing up its ‘red line’ in Syria, and deferred action to allies who had depended on us to lead. Now that our enemies have gained strength after we showed weakness, the President has concluded that we must again put men and women of our armed forces in harm’s way.\n \nWe face a real threat, and our nation needs to show leadership. If President Obama is finally ready to drop the wobbly rhetoric and lead a coalition, I am prepared to offer him the support he needs to put down the extremists who threaten us and have committed horrendous crimes against humanity. Several of my colleagues and I have put our support behind H.J. Resolution 123, which would require the President to present a strategic plan to Congress, replaces the old 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq, and provides the President with a new, short-term authorization for the use of force to defeat ISIS. Rhetoric doesn’t win wars. If President Obama is now prepared to seek authorization for action against ISIS, I’m prepared to give it to him.	10152386663252993

19463427992	President Obama will hold a press conference this morning at 10:45 after his meeting with Secretary Shinseki to address the Veterans Affairs scandals. Will this administration hold itself accountable for the failures to our veterans?	10152160592262993
19463427992	As VA scandals across the country are coming to light, the federal government must renew its commitment to our veterans and work harder to meet their needs. Next week the House will vote on H.R. 4031 to make it easier to hold VA leaders accountable by demoting or firing those who fail to live up to their responsibilities. Our veterans deserve this action and accountability.	10152151393867993
19463427992	I am proud to have supported our armed services, through last week’s vote on the bipartisan Military and Veterans’ funding bill (H.R. 4486).  We need to focus on providing superior care and eliminating claims backlogs for veterans while working to improve base services for our men and women in uniform. We must never forget their service and sacrifice.	10152130887977993
19463427992	Transparency advocates have a favorite saying: sunshine is the best disinfectant. Think of the DATA Act as sunshine goes digital. \n\nREAD MORE in my latest op-ed: http://bit.ly/QWewJ4	10152119088757993
19463427992	Today, the Oversight Committee voted to hold Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress. By doing so, the Committee upheld its obligation to pursue the truth about the IRS targeting of Americans because of their political beliefs. Our investigation has found that Lois Lerner played a central role in the targeting scandal and then failed to meet her legal obligations to answer questions after she waived her right not to testify. If the House takes up and passes the contempt resolution, the matter will be referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, which statute requires he take to a grand jury.\n\nFULL PRESS RELEASE HERE: http://1.usa.gov/1gdB8xT	10152080980802993
19463427992	Tonight I’m glad to have supported legislation to allow Americans to donate in support of Philippine typhoon relief.  Ravaged by typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, Filipinos are still working hard to rebuild their country, and this bill makes it easier for more Americans to extend their generosity to the victims of the typhoon and assist in their efforts.	10152051063537993
19463427992	Today I voted to preserve senior access to quality healthcare through Medicare reform entitled, the Sustainable Growth Rate Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014, (H.R. 4015).  This bill replaces an outdated reimbursement system for San Diego doctors and all physicians throughout our country, by fairly and accurately paying providers. I am pleased to have championed the efforts to fix this problem while addressing an unpopular problem in the new health care law.  I urge the Senate to take swift action to ensure our seniors continue to receive quality medical care.	10152032058757993
19463427992	I'll be on Fox News Sunday at 9 AM this morning. Hope you'll tune in.	10152011226402993
19463427992	I appreciate the feedback I've received from you about my vote yesterday to increase the debt ceiling. I dedicate much of my time and effort in Congress to exposing misuse of taxpayer funds and wasteful spending that should be eliminated. This will continue to be a top priority. However, refusing to raise the debt ceiling wouldn't cut a single dollar from federal spending. American families and small businesses cut costs by keeping their credit cards in their wallets, not objecting when the bill arrives. Congress should do the same.	10151979551777993
19463427992	OBAMACARE WEBSITE COULD ONLY HANDLE 1,100 USERS: Yesterday, as Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Darrell released new documents which show HealthCare.gov could only handle 1,100 users in testing the day before the website launched. \n\nREAD MORE ABOUT THE NEW OBAMACARE DOCUMENTS HERE: http://nbcnews.to/1a9Zhkv	10151793578092993
19463427992	SMALL BUSINESSES FORCED TO PURCHASE OBAMACARE:  Small businesses – defined as companies with 50 employees or less – in DC and Vermont will be forced to purchase insurance through state exchanges established under Obamacare despite objections from companies wishing to purchase private, competitive insurance plans.\n \nYesterday, Darrell sent a letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius seeking more information about the mandated Obamacare exchanges.\n \nFROM DARRELL:\n“[T]he District’s proposal to force individuals and small businesses onto its exchange is inconsistent with principles of consumer choice and competition, which are vital to a well functioning health insurance market.”\n \nREAD MORE HERE:  http://bit.ly/1avte0C\n \n‘LIKE’ and ‘SHARE’ this if you agree small businesses and individuals deserve the opportunity to choose their own healthcare.	10151545758632993

19463427992	It's never enough to just say thank you, and one day a year is far too few to recognize the ultimate  sacrifice our men and women have paid to defend this country.\n\nWe are a free nation and a free people - from the Gloucester Bay fishermen to the Californian farmer -  because so many were willing to sacrifice so much for freedom.\n\nTo all who are wearing or who've worn a uniform, thank you.	10151480394932993
79072979038	Proud to have voted against TPA (fast track) today...	10153153020089039
79072979038	It was an honor to speak yesterday at Marine Corps Sergeant Rafael Peralta's Navy Cross ceremony.  Peralta is a true inspiration, and so too is the entire Peralta family.  The fight to upgrade his award will continue when the time is right, but both his legacy and sacrifice have endured and that's more important than any valor award.  There are Marines alive today because of what Peralta did--and they have committed to living in his honor.  Truly remarkable.	10153147003839039
79072979038	Had a great site visit with the Coast Guard--and I was in the driver seat of the CG 33, which is used to interdict fast boats, for the action shot.  Compliments to the Coast Guard for some great photo work.	10153145440589039
79072979038	In FL right now with the Commandant of the Coast Guard--observing drug interdiction up close.  Spending time later with Marine Corps General John Kelly (in the running for USMC Commandant), Southern Command.	10153140333564039
79072979038	On Memorial Day, I had the honor of speaking at the Singing Hills Memorial Park Ceremony in El Cajon.  The ceremony drew many veterans and families that expressed their gratitude and respect for those who have served and sacrificed so much.  Truly inspiring.  And I was able to catch up with a local legend: General Bob Cardenas (pictured in blue blazer).	10153110830804039
79072979038	Today is the 70th anniversary of VE Day--Victory in Europe, marking the end to World War II on the continent.  Much is forever owed to all those who dedicated themselves to the cause of freedom.	10153072740749039
79072979038	Some pictures from my keynote address last Saturday, celebrating the christening and launch of TOTE Lines LNG containership at NASSCO.  It's an impressive ship--and a testament to our ability to still innovate and manufacture.	10153047308729039
197737020257085	5 years after the #DeepwaterHorizon tragedy we must continue to take every precaution so that history does not repeat itself.	965211046843008
79072979038	Had a great visit yesterday with the U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Safety and Security Team 91109 in San Diego.  They're doing some impressive things and I'm thankful for the chance to see it all up close.  They're helping to keep our community and nation safe--which we all value.	10152957533654039
79072979038	Some great photos of U.S. Army and Special Forces (SF) Major Matt Golsteyn--who had his Distinguished Service Cross (second to Medal of Honor) revoked by the Army Secretary along with his SF tab.  Why? The Army alleges he killed an unarmed bomb maker in Afghanistan responsible for the death of Marines.  The Army was never able to prove the allegation, so they are administratively punishing Golsteyn.  I'll post a story due out early next week with the latest.	10152957389719039
79072979038	Enjoyed some target practice yesterday on the heels of the ATF decision to drop the proposed ammo ban. A big thanks to the American Shooting Center for the opportunity to fire both green and non-green tip ammo.	10152953610034039
79072979038	A border security bill with no fencing?  NO WAY.	10152862975424039
79072979038	Here's my thought on American Sniper--now that I've seen the film.  All the negative talk is hot air.  It's a great portrayal of certain realities of combat.  Maybe these truths are hard for some folks to accept--and I understand that.  But what Michael Moore and similar minds say gives all the more reason to ignore them.  When I was in Fallujah, snipers--including Chris Kyle--saved the lives of many Marines, providing over-watch.  They gave assurance and a sense of protection we needed.  For that... and much more, I'm grateful.	10152862809439039
79072979038	For tonight's State of the Union, I'll be joined by Andrew Tahmooressi.  I'm honored to have him as a guest.	10152849772244039
79072979038	In case you missed the report last night -- Andrew Tahmooressi was released from Mexican custody... It's a moment that's long overdue.  All sides came to an agreement weeks ago and it wasn't a matter of if, but when for the Mexican judge.  It's great news for Andrew, his family and anyone who has taken an active interest in his case.  Now Andrew can begin his recovery.  #MarineheldinMexico	10152665522144039
79072979038	Met up with the author of the NY Times Best Seller, Code Name: Johnny Walker.  Covered lots of ground, including the fight against IS and the book, of course.	10152634979484039
79072979038	#MarineheldinMexico -- call the Mexican embassy in the U.S. today and give your support for Andrew.  Please share this post after you call: 202-728-1600.  Requests to close the case in Andrew's favor have been filed--and the hope is for a final judgement any day.	10152629757634039
79072979038	9-11-2001.  9-11-2012.  Today we remember the thousands of Americans who died in 2001 and the four Americans who died 11 years later in the attack in Benghazi, Libya.  Also in our minds and our hearts are the brave men and women who have fought overseas--and those who continue to fight.  Never forget.	10152547800419039
79072979038	Update on Andrew Tahmooressi #MarineHeldinMexico.  The Mexican border official at the center of the controversy appears to have been demoted.  From what I'm told, though it probably won't be acknowledged publicly, the demotion is due to Andrew's case.	10152534448549039
79072979038	The House of Representatives today passed its 7th of 12 annual appropriation bills--to keep the federal government running past Oct 1, the start of the next fiscal year.  How many has Harry Reid and Senate Democrats passed?  ZERO.	10152410875564039
79072979038	Tomorrow, June 26, the Supreme Court will decide whether it will take the case pertaining to the Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial.  Let's hope they do--and eventually put this issue to rest once and for all by preserving the Memorial.	10152368433999039
79072979038	Good news today that Bowe Bergdahl is in US hands.  Though sure to be concerns around the prisoner swap and the options that were passed over--all of them equally promising but not involving a 5 for 1 swap. Regardless, for today, it's welcome news that the only US soldier in captivity is no longer in enemy hands.	10152316192779039

79072979038	Does the Constitution grant the President the authority to decide what laws to enforce?  Do Americans have the same right to decide what laws to follow and what laws to ignore?  The answer is no.  Legislation passed by the House today holds the President accountable by allowing the House and/or Senate to file a lawsuit on behalf of the American people for failure to execute federal laws.  It's a good measure that should apply to all Administrations.	10152160570654039
79072979038	Nice to see the Senate do something worthwhile—passing today H.R. 2019, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act.  I’m proud to be a cosponsor of the bill (passed the House in Dec 2013), which eliminates taxpayer funding for presidential campaigns and conventions, and redirects that funding to pediatric medical research.	10152158161404039

176942192453747	I’m proud to join Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, Rep Joe Heck, Senator Mazie K. Hirono, and U.S. Senator Tim Kaine to introduce the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act today. I am an original cosponsor of this bill because I firmly believe that we need to officially recognize the service of our Filipino friends and allies – many of whom made the ultimate sacrifice serving under our flag – and thank them for their contributions to victory in the Pacific. This bill will award these heroes with our highest expression of national appreciation.	525655120915784

We trust our cars’ airbags and it is vital that we act immediately to restore safety in the cars and trucks we all rely on. I will continue to demand answers so that quick action is taken to prevent accidents and avoid unnecessary injury.	10153443107298489
110757973488	Last night, I called on House Republicans to stop their efforts to further undermine the construction of the Aurora VA Hospital. I am as upset as anyone with the history of this project and will continue to hold those responsible for these problems accountable. Above all else, it’s imperative the project keep moving forward for our veterans.  \n\nOur community can’t afford political games. For all of the legitimate and deserved criticism of the VA, Republican Committee Leaders are now taking out their anger on Colorado veterans. \n\nClick to share and tell them that when you cut off your nose to spite your face you are hurting our friends, our neighbors, and our service members.	10153381085358489

Today the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment was awarded the Clean Air Excellence Award for our state’s 2014 Oil and Gas Emission Reduction Initiative. The initiative combined cutting edge technology with a common sense approach to target pollution at the source and reduce overall emissions by more than 150,000 tons each year.\n\nThis initiative would not have been possible with the collaboration of a broad coalition of industry, environmental and local government stakeholders who all shared a desire for a better, cleaner Colorado. Thank you for your work for our state, our skies, and the air we all breathe.	10153328111358489

110757973488	I started my day by having breakfast with leaders from the Denver metro area African American community including City Council President Christopher J. Herndon, Denver Police Department Chief Robert White, Albus Brooks: Denver City Councilman, and Pastor Anthony Grimes. I spoke about important priorities like making housing more affordable, schools better equipped to educate our children, and voting rights more equal. During our discussion, I was delighted to get insightful questions that covered a huge range of perspectives. Topics ranged from what we need to do to improve the relationship between police and the community to whether I support connecting light rail to North Denver (I absolutely do).\n\nThank you to everyone who helped make this morning’s breakfast such a great opportunity to have important and frank conversations. I look forward to  our continued work to make Denver better for everyone.	10153245427448489

110757973488	I just voted with 223 of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle against a Republican leadership bill that would continue to jeopardize long-term funding for the Department of Homeland Security. We cannot continue with another man made crisis. While House Republican leadership considers whether they will introduce a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, thousands of dedicated public safety workers don’t know whether their next paycheck will come, and important grants for Colorado first responders remain frozen.\n\nThe time is up, let’s pass a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security.

I look forward to the many ways these PeaceCorps volunteers use their experiences to make our world a better place.	10153190357978489
110757973488	Five years ago today, the Supreme Court of the United States declared that corporations have the same rights as people and that their campaign contributions cannot be restricted.\n\nI believe this decision makes a mockery of our basic political principle; one person-one vote. Unregulated, corporate political contributions do not enable political speech; they drown out the voices of millions of Americans.\n\nI look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stop the flood of secret money in politics and to return the fundamental right of political speech to the people for which it was intended.	10153103018408489

110757973488	Today marks another important step towards full equality: the Supreme Court declined to take up appeals from gay marriage opponents in five different states. This means that those five states – and others including Colorado – should soon overturn marriage bans. The Colorado Supreme Court should promptly accept this decision and let all loving couples choose to marry freely. And the day is soon coming that everyone in the nation will enjoy this basic right.	10152820959213489
110757973488	One year ago today, House Republican leadership shut down the government in an attempt to force through their agenda to repeal healthcare reform. It cost our economy $24 billion and 120,000 jobs, halted business loans, disrupted job training for returning veterans, prevented patients from entering NIH clinical trials, and furloughed two-thirds of the staff at the Centers for Disease Control. I’m relieved Republican leaders did not repeat such irresponsible behavior this year, and I’m now working on a bipartisan project to modernize medical research, but Congress must never do this kind of direct damage to the country.	10152806765378489

53481427529	This week we have seen students in Jefferson County voicing their concerns about proposed changes to their U.S. History curriculum being considered by the County School Board. While I don't sanction missing school, I applaud these students for taking such an active interest in not only their personal education, but the education of their peers and those who will attend school in Jefferson County for years to come. \n\nTheir activism is a far greater and more relevant example of civic education than much of what occurs in the classroom. Our nation and our state have proud histories of small groups of people standing up for what they think is right and making a real difference. \n\nI hope that the Jefferson County School board will listen to these students' concerns and that their actions will inspire other students and parents to take an interest in their curriculum to help improve educational opportunities for all.	10152551973202530
53481427529	Today I voted against the President's proposal to train and arm Syrian rebels. After extensive study and briefings, I lack the confidence that the people we train and arm will help keep us safe, and I fear that in some cases they might even cooperate with our enemies including ISIL and in other ways act to undermine American and humanitarian interests.\n\nWe recently engaged in a similar but far larger eight-year, $25 billion effort to train and equip Iraq’s military, and yet many of the weapons and supplies that Americans paid for have now wound up in the hands of ISIL. The Iraqi army that we invested in building has lost control of large portions of Iraq. Why should we think that the same strategy, made even harder in this case by occurring during a crisis and involving various rebels without a regular command structure, will succeed?\n\nI will continue to encourage the President and my colleagues to come up with a better plan to keep America safe and deal with the threat that ISIL presents.	10152539611427530

53481427529	Today the House of Representative approved a bill I introduced, the Lake Hill Administrative Site Affordable Housing Act (HR 2337). This bill conveys 40 acres of the Lake Hill property in the White River \nNational Forest to Summit County, Colorado so that the county can partner with developers to build affordable housing. High rent has\ndriven many hardworking employees in Summit County to live further and grow, affordable housing is becoming increasingly important. This bill is an important step towards helping the community use the Lake Hill property in a way that improves the quality of life in Summit County. H.R. 2337 is a win-win because it will add affordable housing opportunities while providing funding for U.S. Forest Service to improve administrative facilities.	10151833699587530
53481427529	Is your college tuition too high? Are you worried about your kids being able to afford college? Federal policy leads to higher and higher college costs by stifling innovative approaches to learning. I'm doing my best to fix that and reduce the cost of college. Yesterday the House Committee on Education and the Workforce passed a bill that I am sponsoring with Rep. Matt Salmon (R-AZ) to allow colleges and universities the flexibility to provide a degree that is based on a student’s knowledge and skills instead of seat time. Currently, colleges and universities must adhere to traditional, rigid structures, based on the Carnegie unit, or credit hour, which limit the schedules on which students can enroll and when students can receive financial aid. There is no reason to elongate the higher education process simply to meet arbitrary benchmarks; if students can learn the same knowledge quicker then it's also cheaper! When a student has mastered the material necessary to earn a degree, then they should get the degree. Competency-based education is a crucial tool to speed up to completion, making higher education more affordable for students.\n\nI’m also excited that the Committee passed the Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act, a bill that includes many components of my Know Before You Owe Act. It is critical that students must have complete information about their college financing options – including understanding that private student loans often have higher interest rates and less favorable repayment options. This bill will help students in Colorado and across the country make more informed decisions about their college choices.	10152387986327530
53481427529	The President made history today by issuing an executive order to prevent federal contractors from firing employees just because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Along with several of my colleagues, I had been urging to the President to do just that for some time, and I am so pleased that this Pride Month he took this important action to support #LGBT equality.\n\nThis means that twenty percent the American workforce, everyone who works for a company that holds a federal contract, can no longer be fired just because of who they love or who they are. That's a huge deal and an important step towards a fairer, juster, and more efficient country. People should be judged by their bosses on the quality of their work, not who they love.\n\nHowever important this step is, across the nation there remain too many Americans who are faced with the unfortunate reality of hate and injustice as they pursue a career. It is time for the Congress to stand up to prejudice and pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (#enda)now to protect all Americans from workplace discrimination! The votes are there, the need is there, all we are waiting for is the courage of the Speaker to be there.	10152332342547530
53481427529	Together we have made history in the battle for common sense #marijuana law reforms and for the first time passed an amendment on the House floor that is the start of the end of national prohibition.\n\nMy amendment with Dana Rohrabacher and others to stop the Department of Justice from using funds to prevent states from implementing their own State laws that "authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana" passed by a bipartisan 219-189 vote.\n\nThe last time that we brought a similar amendment to the floor in 2012 we lost 163-262, which demonstrates the tremendous change of popular opinion on this issue in the last two years alone.\n\nThis appropriations bill has several stops before it becomes laws, and will likely never become law on its own, but what happened in the wee hours of the morning this morning is nevertheless EXTREMELY important. A majority of the House of Representatives voted to essentially disengage the federal government from moving against states that allow the sale of medical marijuana. That's a huge deal and now that a majority for reform exists, the issue will finally start to move at the national level to catch up with where states like #colorado already are.	10152293742632530

53481427529	Last night, the Senate completed the first step in passing  the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would prevent Americans from being fired just because they are gay, lesbian, or transgender, with a cloture vote of 61-30. The last time ENDA was voted on in the Senate in 1996, it failed—by only one vote. Our nation has made great strides in protecting equality in the workplace with 21 states including Colorado already extending workplace protections, but there is still much to be done. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act has over 190 co-sponsors in the House, both Democrats and Republicans. Yet Speaker Boehner has said that he will not bring this important legislation to the floor. While I applaud my colleagues in the Senate for their bipartisan effort, we must continue this momentum and bring ENDA to a vote in the House. Employment discrimination is wrong, inefficient, and hurts the economy. Just as it’s wrong to fire someone based on their race or gender, it is wrong to fire them based on who they love. Tell the House and Speaker Boehner to #PassENDA now.	10151852690922530

53481427529	After 16 days, the House FINALLY voted on a bill to not only reopen the government immediately, but also to increase the debt ceiling before tomorrow's looming default deadline. It's about time.\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal employees can finally get back to work and government agencies, like FEMA and the National Park Service, can fully function and serve the people.\n\nWhen Congress pats itself on the back for solving a problem entirely of its own making, you know something is very wrong with the picture.\n\nIt is simply unacceptable that it took 16 full days of uncertainty to come to an agreement that was basically laid out on day one. I hope this senseless government shutdown teaches the more reckless elements that we should responsibly work together to improve the lives of Coloradans and all Americans without resorting to punching ourselves in the face.\n\nI am proud to say the bill we passed today also raises the cap on emergency relief transportation funding so Colorado is able to repair road damage caused by last month's horrendous flooding.\n\nAll of the above is good news. The bad news is that this bill is just a short-term extension and we will be facing another government closure and debt default in just three months. I will encourage and engage in meaningful negotiations to restore sustained fiscal integrity to the federal government and balance our budget rather than continuing to govern crisis to crisis.\n\nThe Hippocratic Oath that all doctors take is "do no harm." Maybe the United States Congress should incorporate that into the oath of office.	10151807098742530

53481427529	Although I strongly opposed the Republican FARRM bill, I was pleased to see that the bipartisan amendment that I offered with Representatives Blumenauer and Massie was included in the final bill that passed the House of Representatives today. This commonsense amendment will allow colleges and universities like Colorado State University to grow and cultivate industrial hemp for academic and agricultural research purposes in states where industrial hemp growth and cultivation is already legal. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that this language becomes law. \n\nhttps://polis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=342302	10151615402067530

191428784201721	Today in the House we passed the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act (H.R. 235), which makes permanent the ban on taxing internet access.

191428784201721	There was an article in the Glenwood Post Independent this week did not accurately report my remarks and position on Obamacare. Despite saying the same thing on the issue that I’ve consistently said many times before—that Obamacare isn’t working, and it needs to be repealed and replaced—the reporter, who is a good guy, heard my comments differently. I don’t believe there was any malicious intent here, but sometimes no matter how clearly you say things or how many times you say them, people hear or interpret them differently. That said, my position on Obamacare is very clear: it needs to be repealed and replaced (and I have backed that position up with my votes). The law has failed to achieve the basic goals of accessibility and affordability, and I’m working with my colleagues in the House on replacement solutions to achieve those ends. I’ve stated the same position countless times over the past several years as I did in the meetings in Glenwood this week.	944982485513010

191428784201721	While the President congratulated himself on a recovering American economy tonight, the economic challenges that the people of Colorado’s 3rd District continue to face are not cause for celebration. The labor participation rate remains at a 36 year low, with tens-of-millions of working age Americans unable to find the work they need to makes ends meet, and the middle class is shrinking every year. Accounting for those that have stopped looking for work because of a lack of opportunity, many of the 29 counties in Colorado’s 3rd District are suffering from double digit unemployment. Opportunities for growth have been blocked by overreaching and punitive federal regulations that have restricted access to public land, closed small businesses and prevented many more from opening their doors.\n\nTax increases, as the President is pushing once again, won’t solve these continued economic challenges or grow the middle class, nor will they address broad problems within the tax code or shrink the national debt. The President is even going so far as to propose taxing college savings plans that have been exempt from taxation in the past so he can fund his plan to pay for community college—where is the sense in that?\n\nInstead of pushing for more divisive tax increases, the President could take a look at the many pieces of legislation passed with bipartisan support in the last Congress as a starting point to move forward on areas of common interest. Among those bills are efforts we passed out of the 3rd District to protect private water rights, address forest health and encourage responsible all-of-the-above domestic energy production.\n\nIt’s time for a new approach and fresh ideas to empower people and strengthen Main Street.\n\nTo get there, we need a fairer, flatter and simpler tax code, decreased federal regulations and red tape, a long-term plan for responsible all-of-the-above domestic energy development, affordable and accessible healthcare for all Americans, and federal budgeting that ends deficit spending and begins to pay down the staggering national debt. Economic power should be in the hands of hardworking Americans not controlled by a centralized Washington bureaucracy.  \n\nI believe that we have an opportunity to find common ground to strengthen the middle class and grow the tax base by incentivizing the type of innovation and investment that ignites private sector growth and fuels job creation and higher wages. For that to happen, the President will need to work with the House and Senate that the American people sent to Washington. Executive overreach is being checked, and Congress will continue to aggressively fight back if the President continues down this go-nowhere path.\n\nWe will be working in Congress to address the challenges facing our nation and restore opportunity for students, families and all Americans striving for the American Dream. I sincerely hope that the President will put politics aside and actively work with us to solve America’s challenges, rather than sit on the sidelines with a veto pen.	920160497995209
191428784201721	Tonight, the President will give the 93rd State of the Union address.

45059452286	Time and time again, President Obama has abused the trust of Congress and the American people. On issues ranging from healthcare regulations to illegal immigration, he has said one thing and done another. This approach has poisoned his relationship with both parties in Congress and made it extraordinarily difficult to work on many issues. He has maintained this self-centered attitude with trade negotiations. That's why the Congress has to step in and roll back these abuses of negotiating power and shine a harsh light on his trade proposals.   \n\nOf the multiple pieces of trade legislation considered this week, Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) was the most egregious. This bloated, wasteful, and unsuccessful program is a budget-busting handout designed to placate union activists. Chicago-style politics like this has no place in any open and straightforward trade negotiations, and that's why I opposed TAA.\n\nI support free trade. One of every five jobs in America depends on trade and 96% of the customers and consumers of the world are located outside of the United States. In Colorado alone, over 700,000 jobs are related to trade and we export over $22 billion. It is very important that I clear up some misperceptions that have grown up around this topic: voting for Trade Promotion Authority does not automatically mean that I support the Trans Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement.  Also, Trade Promotion Authority allows Congress and the American people an open and transparent opportunity to review the TPP.\n\nHonesty and integrity is important to this process. That is why I supported the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act to ensure that any future Trans Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement won't include any provisions dealing with immigration, global warming, or climate change. This bill also makes sure that trade rules are properly enforced and bolsters our trade relationships with allies like Israel.\n\nRight now, that process is not open and transparent. Just this week, I reviewed portions of the TPP. I was kept in a secure room in a basement and was allowed to see the document only in secret. They wouldn’t even let me take notes! Trade Promotion Authority changes this process for the better. That’s why this bill is so important. It ensures that Congress will have an up-or-down vote on the trade agreements being negotiated by the Obama Administration. Trade Promotion Authority brings Congress and the American people into the discussions and ensures that everything is done in the light of day. It empowers Members of Congress as advisors and negotiators with the right to attend trade negotiations and receive consultations from the US Trade Representative. Most importantly, it will require that the full text of any potential trade deal be publically available to the American people at least 60 days before the completion of any deal.\n\nTrade Promotion Authority is constitutional because it allows Congress to retain its authority to approve or reject trade agreements. If we don’t pass TPA, we will cede this authority to President Obama. I want to be crystal clear with people, this bill does not grant any new authority to President Obama, period. In fact, it makes it more difficult for him to negotiate and implement secret plans and programs with other nations. \n\nThe population growth and the economic trends of the next few decades are all projected to take place in the Pacific region. China is aggressively and effectively negotiating in the region. If the United States is not in the driver’s seat creating conditions for Free Trade, China will be in charge of making the rules and rigging the game in one of the most important regions of the world. The TPA excludes China.  \n\nWe must ask ourselves this simple question, is China going to make the rules of our global economy, or will the United States continue to lead, as we always have?	10153399274512287

45059452286	Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of partnering with Debbie Chaves and Colorado Family Action in hosting a small group discussion on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. \n\nThis legislation, which passed the House and that I cosponsored, bans abortions after 20 weeks (five months) of pregnancy, allows exceptions for when the mother's life is threatened, or rape or incest occur, and provides compassionate care for mother and child.\n\nThe scientific and moral issues in this case are clear. Babies feel pain at the five month mark and medical developments are moving up the point of viability. The United States is one of only seven nations on Earth that allow elective abortions five months into the pregnancy. As science advances, we are living in an age of life. Recent polling shows that 60% of the public supports H.R. 35. I have a 100% pro-life record and will continue to be one of the leading champions and advocates for life in the entire Congress.\n\nThank you to Sarah Zagorski of Colorado Citizens for Life, Mike Norton of Alliance Defending Freedom, Jessica Haverkate of Colorado Family Action, and all of the faith leaders and concerned citizens who joined us to discuss this vitally important issue.\n\nThe Senate should begin debating the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in the next few weeks. I would encourage you to personally contact Senators Michael Bennet and Cory Gardner and strongly urge them to support the bill in the Senate.	10153391887192287

45059452286	This week, I supported H.R. 2578, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act of 2016. \n\nThe House has worked diligently to provide the most efficient investments possible to these agencies. Many amendments were added strengthening the Second Amendment rights of Americans, toughening anti-drug measures, and assisting veterans with mental health issues. Our prudent investments will allow America to continue to serve as a global leader in the fields of counterterrorism, law enforcement, space exploration, scientific research, and cybersecurity.\n\nI also offered an amendment designed to prohibit the ATF from using funding to utilize license plate readers to collect information on individuals attending gun shows. Under this program, mere attendance at a gun show would have been enough to have one’s attendance recorded in a massive DEA database whose primary purpose is asset forfeiture, a controversial practice of seizing motorists’ possessions if police suspect they are criminal proceeds. Many of the seizures taking place without any evidence of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nThis amendment was supported by the National Rifle Association, the Gun Owners of America, and the American Civil Liberties Union. Unfortunately, Democrats used a parliamentarian gimmick to prohibit consideration of the amendment. \n\n More information on the bill here: http://appropriations.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=394203	10153378061682287

45059452286	Today, I voted in favor of the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). I added or supported seven more amendments to the bill on the House Floor. \n\nSupporting our men and women in uniform is vitally important to the safety and security of the United States. It was profoundly disappointing to see so many Democrats turn away from our brave warriors and vote against this bill. This is a good and important bill. I’ve been working on it for months now, and have added provisions at subcommittee, full committee, and on the floor. We address critical issues in military space, missile defense and almost every area of national security policy. I addressed a range of issues impacting Colorado Springs and our military bases here. I also added a provision to establish a partnership with Israel to develop tunnel detection technology, because we are facing tunnel threats on our southern border as well as the threat of terrorists using tunnels around the world. The bottom line is that this is a good bill and we must continue to make sure that our national security is our top priority.\n\nCongressman Lamborn's Floor Amendments to the NDAA:\n\nAmendment 5 (with Reps. Brooks, Palmer, Blackburn, Fleming, Smith, Bridenstine, Gosar, Lummis, King, Brat, Palazzo, Ratcliffe, Babin, Duncan, Duncan, Collins, Barletta, Jones, Olson, Perry, Bilirakis, Graves, McClintock, Neugebauer, Aderholt, Weber, Loudermilk, Flores, Franks, Gohmert, and Kelly): Strikes section 538, relating to a sense of the House of Representatives regarding Secretary of Defense review of section 504 of title 10, United States Code, regarding enlisting certain illegal aliens in the Armed Forces.\n\nAmendment 26: Adds language to the underlying Iran Sense of Congress regarding the sale of S-300’s and the importance of terrorism related sanctions.\n\nAmendment 27: Limits funding for implementing the New START treaty. \n\nAmendment 54 (with Reps. Fleming, Stefanik, and Jones): Requires a report and certification by the Secretary of Defense that an Army active duty end strength below 490,000 soldiers will be adequate to meet the U.S. national military strategy. \n\nAmendment 101: Adds a limitation on military-to-military exchanges and contacts with Iran.\n\nAmendment 107: Adds a requirement for a report on Qatar’s efforts to combat terrorism.\n\nAmendment 108: Expresses a Sense of Congress in support of Jordan. \n\nPlease click here to watch some of the amendment Floor debate:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frXyGjyKzFw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9LhK54wQ8E\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DspDsmvrCI	10153308755917287

45059452286	Today, I supported H.R. 1191, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. This bill requires a review by the House and Senate of any nuclear agreement with Iran before President Obama can waive or suspend sanctions previously imposed by Congress.\n\nPresident Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have stumbled through months of negotiations that don't appear to have limited Iran's march toward a nuclear weapon. By mandating Congressional oversight and involvement, H.R. 1191 ensures that this nuclear deal will receive the closest possible scrutiny and will open the door to a more active participatory role for the Congress. Although is only a baby step in the right direction, it does make some progress that is worth supporting. When we are dealing with something that could fundamentally change the balance of power in the Middle East, we cannot afford to rush through any agreement without proper Congressional oversight and due diligence. \n \nPassage of this legislation is a major victory for the American people and for the safety and security of this nation and our allies, but it is only the first step. If a deal is reached Congress must work together to insure that it is in fact a good deal. And, if not, Congress must do its role and disapprove of such a deal.\n \nMore Information (courtesy of the House Republican Conference):\n\nCongressional Review:  Requires the President to submit to Congress, within five days of concluding a comprehensive agreement with Iran: (1) the text of the agreement and all related materials; (2) a verification assessment on Iranian compliance; and (3) a certification that the agreement meets U.S. non-proliferation objectives and does not jeopardize U.S. national security, including not allowing Iran to pursue nuclear-related military activities.\n \nNo Suspension of Congressional Sanctions during Review Period:  Prohibits the President from waiving statutory sanctions while Congress reviews the agreement. If the agreement and all related documents are submitted prior to July 10, 2015, Congress has up to 52 days to review the deal and may vote on the agreement in the first 30 days; the President then has 12 days to veto the bill, followed by 10 days for Congress to override such a veto. If the deal is submitted between July 10 and September 7, 2015, Congress has an additional 30 days of review, for a total of up to 82 days.\n \nJoint Resolution of Disapproval:  Gives Congress the opportunity to enact a joint resolution of disapproval (over a presidential veto) within the review period.  Enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval would prevent the President from waiving or suspending the Congressional sanctions.\n \nOversight and Compliance:  Requires the President to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran is complying with the agreement. If Iran violates the terms of the deal, the legislation provides an expedited process for Congress to rapidly restore sanctions.\n \nReporting:  Includes new reporting requirements on Iran’s direct and indirect support for terrorism, human rights violations, and ballistic missile testing.	10153306261862287
45059452286	On Monday, May 18th, from 8:30am to 4:00pm at the Citizens Service Center (1675 Garden of the Gods Road Ste 1107 Room 1020 Colorado Springs, Colorado 80907), the VA will be hosting an event titled, "An Overview of VA Resources for Veterans: What Faith-based, Nonprofit, Community, and Neighborhood Organizations Need to Know"\n\nThis event is an opportunity to learn about the wide array of benefits, programs and services the VA offers to Veterans, their families, Survivors, caregivers, and other beneficiaries. Speakers from the VA, as well as other stakeholders, will discuss various topics, including the Fully Developed Claims process, access to medical and mental health treatment, legal, educational, and community resources available to Veterans.\n\nA primary goal of this event is to facilitate on-going, collaborative working relationships among all VA administrations and staff offices, Veteran-centric offices in other federal agencies, and faith-based, nonprofit and community leaders and organizations.	10153305954032287
45059452286	Today, I voted for H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This legislation bans abortions after 20 weeks (five months) of pregnancy, allows exceptions for when the mother's life is threatened, or rape or incest occur, and provides compassionate care for mother and child. #TheyFeelPain\n\nThe scientific and moral issues in this case are clear. Babies feel pain at the five month mark and medical developments are moving up the point of viability. The United States is one of only seven nations on Earth that allow elective abortions five months into the pregnancy. As science advances, we are living in an age of life. Recent polling shows that 60% of the public supports H.R. 35. I have a 100% pro-life record and will continue to be one of the leading champions and advocates for life in the entire Congress. It is a privilege to continue that today with my co-sponsorship and vote for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\n\nPlease click here to watch my Floor Speech in support of the bill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGHb4ZfzeXc	10153304241262287
45059452286	Last week, it was so fun to take part in the Grand Re-Opening of the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park. A soggy day did not dampen the enthusiasm of over 500 attendees who were tremendously excited to see a new and improved landmark that has been a vibrant tourist attraction for 86 years. The 2013 fire burned over 3,000 acres and destroyed over 90 percent of the park's attractions. I want to commend and thank everyone involved in the rebuilding effort. In the face of such adversity, you have come together and rebuilt, ensuring that Royal Gorge Bridge and Park will remain a crown jewel attraction for future generations.\n\nFor more information on new attractions and activities: http://royalgorgebridge.com/	10153302001302287

366142384492	I’m here today to ask my esteemed colleagues to stand with me in declaring: Let our DREAMers serve.\n\nLet the young men and women who were brought here as children, through no fault of their own, serve their country.\n\nLet them serve the country that educated them.\n\nLet them serve the country they love.\n\nTheir ability to serve benefits us all. It provides an expanded pool of willing and capable applicants, helping to uphold and even increase the rigorous standards to enlist in our military.\n\nThe army recently tripled its pool of immigrant applicants, and DREAMers should be a part of that pool.\n\nTo those who claim that this is amnesty, I have a simple message: As a Marine Corps combat veteran I can assure you Parris Island ain’t amnesty!\n\nAs my late father, a career soldier, told me, serving your nation in uniform is the highest expression of American citizenship.\n\nFrom German immigrants serving in the Continental Army at Valley Forge to the over 100,000 people who have been naturalized through the military since 2002, immigrants have always been a part of our fighting forces.\n\nIf DREAMers want to put their life on the line for this country, we should give them the opportunity and honor their willingness to serve.\n\nI urge my colleagues to vote NO on the Brook’s amendment, which would strip this provision from the NDAA.	10153312833654493

366142384492	Last night and over the weekend I spoke at rallies and vigils in honor of the Ethiopian Christians murdered by ISIS in Libya. I have one of the largest Ethiopian exile populations in the country in my district, and the gruesome killings of their fellow Ethiopians has impacted the community greatly. It doesn't matter what faith you practice, or where you come from, we all must be united to defeat ISIS. \n\nRead more about the vigil in Denver on Saturday here: http://www.denverpost.com/environment/ci_27990079/denvers-ethiopian-community-mourns-countrymen-killed-by-islamic	10153278540129493
366142384492	The vicious murder of Ethiopian Christians by ISIS turns my stomach and boils my blood. I want to extend my deepest sympathies to the families of the victims. ISIS and its allies need to be wiped from the face of the planet. The brutal killings are a reminder of the evil that lurks in this world and the need to remain steadfast in our fight to defeat ISIS.	10153259255554493

366142384492	President Obama is flat wrong about Prime Minister Netanyahu’s address to the People’s House today. I am looking forward to hearing from our great friend and dearest ally. With the President negotiating a bad deal with Ayatollah Khamenei of Iran, who has vowed to wipe Israel off the map, it is essential we the people hear from our friend and ally who will feel the impacts of that deal more than anyone. \n\nOur discourse flourishes in the sunlight of full and open debate, and our political system is made up of co-equal branches of government. The US Congress is the first branch of that government, and today we assert the privileges inherent in our constitutional status.	10153139823164493
366142384492	The White House is angry that supposedly proper procedure was not followed in inviting Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to address a Joint Session of Congress. It's odd that the White House would have its nose out of joint when it comes to diplomatic protocols, but doesn't bat an eye at failing to follow the Constitution.	10153056895709493
366142384492	Unsurprisingly, we heard more plans for government spending and promises of "free stuff" from President Obama tonight, but not enough serious plans to help grow the middle class and cut the national debt that threatens future generations. I'm hoping the President sees the value of working with the new Republican Congress to move this country forward, and not bog it down in more debt.\n\nAmericans expect us to do more than disagree. They sent us to our nation's capital to solve problems. On that note, I was happy to hear the President say he is moving towards negotiating free trade agreements that will help expand markets for our products abroad. In Colorado, 48% of our exports went to countries involved in the Trans Pacific Partnership in 2012 and we need to make it easier for Colorado products to compete there. That's good for Colorado workers and businesses, and good for our nation.	10153043459729493

366142384492	I am profoundly disappointed that neither the President, Vice President, nor the Secretary of State joined the millions of people and dozens of world leaders in France marching for freedom in the face of terrorist attacks.

366142384492	The attack in Paris is a savage reminder that there are terrorists who are at war with us. Today’s attack was a brutal assault on our ideals of free speech and democracy.  We must never waver in the face of such threats and we need to acknowledge terrorist attacks for what they are, an intent to destroy us and the values for which free and democratic countries stand. Those who refuse to recognize the danger these terrorists pose and who are unwilling to take reasonable steps to minimize this threat, which include maintaining facilities such as the one at Guantanamo, only make it more difficult to ultimately protect our citizens.	10153015285689493

Barb, a 7th Degree Black Belt, was one of four members of the U.S. Olympic Taekwondo Team that competed in the 2000 Olympic Games held in Sydney, Australia.  I got to interact with her Academy of Life and Leadership Taekwondo students (bottom left photo), as well as some from the CTA Thornton team (middle photo.)

86174496459	Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a short-term plan to allow for continued construction of the Aurora VA medical center. I'm pleased this deal will allow construction to continue through the busy summer months and prevent further delay in delivering this facility to our veterans.  But I am concerned we are once again kicking the can down the road.  Congress demanded a plan from the VA to complete the project, and while I may not agree with everything in the plan, the VA delivered. \n\nCongress must stop abdicating its responsibility and negotiate a long term solution to complete this medical center.  I will continue working with the Colorado delegation to urge House and Senate leadership to immediately begin negotiating with the VA so Congress can pass a final bill as soon as possible to authorize and fund completion of this world-class medical facility our veterans deserve.	10153336484216460
86174496459	There are arguments for and against Trade Promotion Authority.  I trust President Obama and his economic vision for our country.  He’s turned around an economy that was losing 700,000 jobs per month to managing an economy that has added over 12.5 million jobs for 63 straight months.  The stock market has almost tripled from its lowest point during the great recession. And additionally, I support his effort in reaching a strong and fair trade agreement that will increase environmental, labor, and IP protection standards worldwide, helping to define the future economy of the Pacific Asia region while keeping China in check.\n\nHowever, U.S. trade agreements in the past have not always panned out as promised.  Folks who oppose TPA are rightfully worried about the impact of future trade agreements with respect to labor, environmental standards, and access to affordable medicines.  Although I do not share all of their concerns, I do understand their skepticism. Furthermore in 2011, I voted for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) to support training and education for American workers. I plan to vote for this program again since it has shown to be effective and will not make any cuts to Medicare.\n\nLast year I committed to opposing TPA.  Admittedly it was a different bill then than it is now, however I take my commitments seriously and I will not go back on my word. Consequently, I will oppose the bill for Trade Promotion Authority.	10153336116751460

86174496459	Today I voted against H.R. 2028, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016.  While I appreciate resources provided for important water projects under the bill, the legislation cuts $266 million from research for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) programs and includes several controversial policy riders. These drastic cuts undermine important programs and jeopardize America's competitiveness and economic growth. \n                                                                                                                    \nI cosponsored an amendment to redirect over $25 million to support EERE research like that being done at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden. The important research and development taking place at NREL will change the way we fuel our future and our economy.  H.R. 2028 also failed to fully appropriate Facilities & Infrastructure funding which keeps the lights on at NREL and funds energy integration research being done at the Energy Systems Integration Facility.\n\nWe need to work toward energy independence with clean and efficient technologies to secure America's energy future, power economic growth, create good-paying jobs, and reduce carbon pollution. I will continue to support research and development of more efficient energy use and renewable power sources today to build a cleaner and more sustainable tomorrow.	10153224432336460

86174496459	I didn’t think the Republican budget could get any worse but it has.  After weeks of closed-door negotiations, the Republicans have emerged with a Budget Conference Report that includes $5 trillion in cuts to fundamental programs important to Coloradans and Americans. Programs such as Medicare will no longer exist in its current form along with other programs to help hardworking families buy a house, pay for college, and save for retirement.  The Republicans in the House and Senate have opted to ram through a budget which jeopardizes our kids and grandchildren’s future and chips away at a bright future for our country. With the economy growing stronger every day, we need a budget that invests in our future and continues the positive momentum in Colorado and our nation.	10153223033506460
86174496459	Today, Congressman Denny Heck and I reintroduced the Marijuana Businesses Access to Banking Act of 2015. Legitimate businesses are being shut out of the banking system and forced to operate on a cash-only basis because of outdated federal regulations. This is an issue of public safety.  Not only are the proprietors at risk, but the employees and customers are also at risk of serious and violent crimes.  It is estimated that 40 percent of the marijuana-related businesses in Colorado are unbanked. This means hundreds of millions of dollars in cash are moving around the streets of Colorado. There are now some 213 million Americans who live in the 23 states plus the District of Columbia where the voters have allowed for some use of marijuana.\n\nThis legislation has support from both Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this commonsense legislation forward.	10153220290561460
86174496459	Congratulations to this year’s nine Lakewood Sustainability Award Recipients: Runners Roost, ReFrame Creative Reuse Center, Jefferson County Open School Community Garden, The Center at Warren Tech, and several Defender of the Planet Youth Award winners who are doing incredible things to share environmental knowledge with their peers and change sustainability practices at their schools.

Following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake, 4,000 people are confirmed dead, thousands more are injured, and damage to Nepal’s infrastructure is estimated in the billions. \n\nOver the weekend, the United States Ambassador to Nepal Peter Bodde issued a disaster declaration releasing $1 million in immediate assistance. Today, Secretary of State John Kerry announced an additional $9 million.\n\nNepal is still in the early stages of disaster response, and they will need continued support from the United States and the rest of the international community.\n\nIf you are searching for a loved one, both Google and Facebook have activated search functions for finding if someone was in the disaster area, and if they have been located:\n\nhttp://google.org/personfinder/2015-nepal-earthquake/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/safetycheck/nepalearthquake?pnref=story	10153214530911460

Because of Hubble, we know at the center of nearly every galaxy there is a black hole billions of times more massive than our sun. Hubble helped us understand the process by which planets are born, and with Hubble we discovered the first extrasolar organic matter. We now know the Universe is 13.7 billion years old and theorized it has only recently begun accelerating. \n\nThe farther we look out into the stars the more we understand about our profound but humbling place in the universe.

These men volunteered their time, skills and often their own personal aircraft to do their part for the war effort and help keep the United States safe.\n\nThank you, Colorado Wing-Civil Air Patrol, for your past and continued service.	10153057637766460
86174496459	As part of my assignment to the Science, Space and Technology Committee, I will be serving on the Space and Energy subcommittees. I’m excited to craft policy for these two issues important for Colorado.	10153033836256460
86174496459	I’m pleased to see the President’s budget today. I think his priorities align with what I’ve been working on for several years now and that is a focus on supporting hard working families to get ahead by growing salaries and wages, expanding tax credits for working parents to help afford child care and college tuition, and ensuring a comfortable retirement.  I support the President’s vision of growing the middle class and giving all Colorado families the opportunity to share in our economy’s growth, not just corporate CEO’s and the wealthiest among us.  \n\nHowever, Republicans have yet to fully fund the government through 2015, leading us down the path of a partial government shutdown in less than a month and placing our national security in jeopardy.  Therefore, I’m introducing a bill that would provide the President flexibility from releasing his budget if Congress hasn’t fully funded the government through the previous fiscal year.  In order to appropriately respond to any emerging or ongoing threats, we must ensure the Department of Homeland Security has adequate resources to ensure the safety and security of our country.	10153013666601460
6352928631	Congratulations to Kaylee Yacono, whose acrylic on burlap painting, "Modern American Farmer" was installed today at the U.S. Capitol.	10153319795178632
6352928631	Congratulations to Cigna, one of the finalists for the Department of Defense's 2015 Employer Support Freedom Award. Your commitment to and support of the brave men and women who serve our nation is truly commendable. You've gone above and beyond in caring for your employees and their families.	10153215776573632
6352928631	Today I will be at Trinity College to host a Town Hall Meeting on Nuclear Negotiations with Iran. \n\nThese last few weeks have seen remarkable developments in the global community. Most notably, P5+1 partners have announced the historic framework agreement with Iran. Having a framework for negotiations with Iran is an imperative step towards accomplishing one of the highest foreign policy priorities of the United States: ensuring Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.\n\nI hope you will join me to discuss this important topic, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and questions.

6352928631	Last night I had the great privilege of sitting down with Jenn Bernstein of Fox CT to discuss my proposal to strengthen Social Security. Watch here: http://youtu.be/0-SHMxqnYRs	10153142785563632
6352928631	It is now clear that it’s time to bring a clean, long-term Department of Homeland Security funding bill to the floor after even their own conference rejected their plan. No political difference of opinion is worth risking the safety of our country. Our TSA agents, Homeland Security officials, and other individuals protecting the American people do not deserve to be held hostage any longer.	10153066118468632
6352928631	Many thanks to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro for her work to introduce the Breast Density & Mammography Reporting Act today. I was honored to present Dr. Nancy Cappello of AreYouDense with the Nancy Pilver Breast Cancer Award last year for their advocacy on this effort and am proud to join as a cosponsor of this act that stands to raise awareness of breast cancer risks and the importance of appropriate screening.	10153013582193632
6352928631	For five years, our elections have been bombarded with unreported and unlimited contributions following Citizens United. That decision and others made by the Supreme Court have pushed many out of the electoral process and severely lowered the ability of everyday Americans to have their voice heard. That’s why I recently lead a task force to brainstorm new approaches and legislation to counter these misguided decisions from the Court last Congress. I am proud to join with former Members of the Task Force on Election Reform this year as they introduce several important bills to reverse the impact of Citizens United and know that these measures are proof that not only does the Democratic Caucus have the desire to get money out of politics – we have a plan. I commend my colleagues for their work to strengthen participation in our electoral process and remain committed to eliminating the corrosive impact of money in politics.	10152983912253632
6352928631	Each New Year brings a time to remember the life and honor the work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, our nation comes together in celebration of his legacy and recommits itself to continuing his mission of equality for every American.	10152979636213632
6352928631	Last night moved us closer to fixing our failing immigration system. Now Congress needs to get the job done. We cannot continue to ignore the rising moral and economic costs of inaction and must work together to finish the job and build a fair, effective and commonsense immigration system.	10152820193718632
6352928631	Now more than ever, our nation must stand in unity against a common threat. Thirteen years after 9/11, let us pause and reflect on those we have lost and the sacrifices of those who served and continue to serve our nation.	10152643369018632
6352928631	When Women Succeed, America succeeds. On Women’s Equality Day, let’s continue efforts - like those led by Representative Rosa DeLauro - to bring equality to the workplace.	10152600372278632
6352928631	A year ago today the Supreme Court weakened protections for voters. We must act now to fix and strengthen the Voting Rights Act.	10152462466568632
6352928631	Today I continued my efforts on legislation to require the nation's military healthcare program, TRICARE, to ensure access to behavioral treatments for military families who have children with developmental disabilities. We must honor our military families and ensure access to the care and services they deserve.	10152351667218632
6352928631	Today the White House announced that more than 7 million nationwide have signed up for private health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Connecticut nearly doubled its overall goal with close to 200,000 enrolled in the ACA. This is a great start. I’m pleased by the progress we have made and know we must continue to improve this important legislation and strengthen our healthcare system. For the nation to move forward, Congress must come together for the American people.	10152266615678632
6352928631	It’s unacceptable to leave our veterans behind. The House must renew unemployment insurance to help 200,000 veterans and millions more receive this vital benefit.	10152210152478632
6352928631	Today the President brought his fight for an increased minimum wage to Connecticut. I commend his efforts for our working families. From providing fairer pay and strengthening job training to helping students gain the education they deserve, the President is working to move our nation forward. I thank Governor Malloy for his leadership on an issue that impacts so many in our state and look forward to continuing my work with the Connecticut delegation in Washington.	10152207762663632
6352928631	The strength of our nation rests on opportunity. I applaud President Obama for his call in the State of the Union: that opportunity should never be out of reach because of where you’re from or how much money you have.	10152128526073632
6352928631	Congratulations to Miles Rapoport on being named the new president of Common Cause. From his time in Connecticut to his work with Demos, Miles has fought to lessen inequality and improve our electoral system.	10152098208873632
6352928631	One of the most intelligent and innovative policy strategists I've ever met, Congressman George Miller drove the nation forward in education, labor and health issues over the last four decades. I wish George and his family all the best, thank him for his friendship and congratulate him for everything he has done on behalf of our nation.	10152096126473632
6352928631	Today the Senate moved Congress in the right direction by advancing a bill that would provide relief to 1.3 million Americans impacted by the recent loss of unemployment insurance. Looking ahead, House Leadership cannot hold the American people hostage as this measure advances. In the depths of this cold winter, we must vote to extend benefits that are morally right and economically sound to those who need our help.	10152083908023632
6352928631	Historic confirmation today in the Senate. Congratulations to Dr. Janet Yellen, an economic leader and first Chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.	10152081982328632
6352928631	Pleased to see the Senate Committee confirm Connecticut's Linda Schwartz to be the Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for Policy and Planning yesterday. Now it's the full Senates turn to confirm an individual who knows what it takes to improve the lives of our veterans.	10151971161053632
6352928631	Thank you to all our veterans and those who continue to serve our nation	10151947031283632
6352928631	Tonight, Congress finally came to grips with what the American people have demanded and did its job. The government is funded and our debts are paid...for the time being. Let us hope that hostage politics are over and rational minds prevail.	10151877924188632
330408799230	Over Memorial Day weekend, it was my honor to participate in events in Windham, Enfield, Suffield, and Vernon to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom.	10153315533664231
330408799230	Congratulations to former Connecticut Senator and Governor Lowell Weicker on today’s dedication of the Lowell P. Weicker Building on the Main Campus of the National Institutes of Health in Washington. Then-Senator Weicker’s tireless advocacy for the NIH, especially for HIV/AIDS treatment, was rooted in his commitment to improving public health. Senator Weicker was fearless in his support to fund AZT, helping to make the drug available to AIDS patients and saving countless lives.	10153263173539231
330408799230	I visited Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, the Mill at Killingly Apartments in Danielson, and the Inter Royal Mill site in Plainfield this week to view construction and redevelopment efforts that have received federal support from the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Housing. Eastern Connecticut’s rural towns need access to affordable financing options to complete projects like these, and I worked to maintain eligibility for Connecticut towns to qualify for USDA’s Rural Development program during Farm Bill negotiations last year.	10153200515594231
330408799230	I was honored to present the Congressional Gold Medal to Connecticut WWII Civil Air Patrol Veterans recently in Windsor Locks. http://www.prlog.org/12438418-us-congress-awards-gold-medals-to-connecticut-residents.html	10153166009839231
330408799230	Filled out my bracket for the women’s NCAA tournament—didn’t need to spend much time deliberating on which team will win it all! I’ll be rooting for Coach Geno’s UConn Huskies to bring their 10th national title back home to Storrs, the capitol of college basketball.	10153149858774231
330408799230	At the Speaker’s Annual Friends of Ireland Luncheon today, President Obama and The Prime Minister of Ireland – Taoiseach Enda Kenny both spoke about the influence of Irish culture and history in America. I had a chance to sit with the government delegation from Northern Ireland and continue our discussion on fostering trade links between Connecticut and Northern Ireland, begun during my trip to Belfast last month.	10153144182289231
330408799230	On Friday I visited Westbrook High School students in teacher Brian Dailey’s Comparative History Class to discuss the movie “Lincoln,” and the resource guide I recently issued. The movie wrongly depicted Connecticut representatives as voting against the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, when in fact, all four Connecticut representatives voted in favor of the amendment. I enjoyed our discussion and was very impressed by the students I met.	10153127317499231
330408799230	On Saturday, I was glad to participate in the keel laying ceremony for the USS Colorado, our nation’s newest Virginia Class submarine. U.S. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus joined the ceremony, which marks an important milestone in the ship’s construction.	10153125487624231
330408799230	"The ultimate test of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and moments of convenience, but where he stands in moments of challenge and moments of controversy." -Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., March 1965\nToday we remember the life, legacy, and ongoing work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He devoted his life to furthering the cause of equality and justice for all Americans--a struggle that continues today, drawing inspiration from his example.	10153012725114231
330408799230	It was a pleasure to speak with students at Woodstock Academy last week about my work as a Congressman and to see young students’ interest in the political and legislative process. One of the Woodstock students wrote a report of the visit:\nhttp://www.woodstockacademy.org/page/News-Detail?pk=764042&fromId=177199	10152939199499231
330408799230	I visited the Allen Hill Farm last week, a Christmas tree farm in Brooklyn that’s been in the same family for five generations. They’ve been very busy during the holiday season, and I even got a chance to try their homemade cider!	10152939197684231
330408799230	Best wishes for a merry Christmas! From my family to yours, have a happy and healthy holiday season!	10152927785544231
330408799230	I visited LEGO offices in Enfield recently to tour the newly-expanded Brick House space. After speaking with managers and employees about their growing business, we stopped by the Model Room to see some of the amazing LEGO sculptures. This “Connecticut” sign was one of the highlights!	10152912587959231
330408799230	TTM Technologies celebrated 50 years in business in Stafford this year, and I was honored to join the celebration they hosted last week. TTM, a global company that manufactures printed circuit boards, recently rebuilt the bell tower that originally topped their building, which dates to 1881. The original was removed in 1948, and it is now reconstructed atop the historic former mill.	10152912585704231
330408799230	I was honored to participate in Veterans Day events in Willimantic, Westbrook, Niantic, Mansfield, and Enfield this week. Thank you to all who have served.	10152833431154231

330408799230	This week I joined conservation activists and volunteers, along with local and state officials, for the ribbon cutting at Coogan Farm in Mystic.\nThe Campaign to Save Coogan Farm raised $4.1 million and bought the land last September, thanks to contributions from 760 individuals and businesses and grants from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. The first new project underway at the historic 370-year-old farm is the Giving Garden, a two-acre garden providing fresh produce to needy families in New London County.	10152673309409231
330408799230	I was honored to participate in the Stafford Historical Society’s recent tribute to the historic Warren Mill, which recently reopened as the headquarters of the American Woolen Co.  After working with ownership, state and local leaders and the talented workforce to help revive this eastern Connecticut landmark, I was pleased to join in this exciting celebration of the mill’s history and future.	10152666778829231
330408799230	Earlier this week, I joined Enfield officials to visit local small businesses and the new Business Information Technology Incubator—a valuable resource for Enfield companies that provides meeting space,  training events, and delivers information technology counseling. We then visited Old Country Banquet & Deli, Teaberry Treasures, Peerless Tool & Die Company, and Minuteman Press to hear from small business owners and employees.	10152653032989231
330408799230	It’s hard to believe summer is almost over! One of the highlights of the August district work period was participating in the Bicentennial celebration of the Battle of Stonington.	10152646510534231
330408799230	Good discussion on Connecticut VA, access to health services with Putnam veterans recently. Hearing directly from veterans helps me and my staff identify potential issues that need to be addressed, as well as individuals who might benefit from casework assistance. If you need assistance with a VA issue, you can call my Norwich office or visit http://courtney.house.gov/us-department-of-veterans-affairs/	10152634272359231
330408799230	Had a great time in Enfield this weekend, joining the July 4th celebration and congratulating some of our area's newest young readers!	10152549697009231
330408799230	I was glad to participate earlier this week in a naturalization ceremony for our newest American citizens. A fitting way to kick off Independence Day weekend by spending time with people who have worked hard to become citizens of our great nation.	10152531385029231
330408799230	In the 70 years since the GI Bill was signed into law, the program has opened doors of opportunity for millions of veterans. With the Post-9/11 GI Bill, we are preserving the promise of higher education for our men and women in uniform. This year, the number of veterans who have used the Post-9/11 GI Bill to attend college exceeded one million. Investing in the success of our military veterans is an investment in our country's next generation of leaders.	10152499291474231

6274109770	Today marks #EqualPayDay: Today provides a reminder of the persistent inequities that women face in the workforce. With women bringing home an increasingly bigger share of family income, smaller paychecks hurt their spouses and children, as well as the entire economy.\n\nPaying women the same as their male counterparts would mean more money for gas, more food on the table, more money in the college fund and more spending to support our local economy.	10153230487579771
6274109770	Today marks #EqualPayDay: the day when women finally make the same amount that their male counterparts made the previous year. Women working full-time, year-round make an average of only  78 cents for every dollar earned by a man. \n\nI believe the single biggest economic issue facing American families today is that too many jobs do not pay enough to live on. #EqualPay is a crucial part of the solution to this problem. Paying women the same as their male counterparts would mean more money for gas, more food on the table, more money in the college fund and more spending to support our local economy.	10153230482659771
6274109770	Since the start of the new Congress, I have worked on critical pieces of legislation including #jobtraining, #equalpay, #paidsickleave, support for education, affordable #healthcare, and improved nutrition standards. What ties all of these issues together is my fundamental focus on serving the middle-class.\n\nDespite a growing economy and rising employment, families are still struggling. Too many people are in jobs that just do not pay them enough to make ends meet, let alone get ahead in this economy. I am working on a legislative agenda based in middle-class economics, and I won't stop until we relieve the economic pressures on working men and women today.	10153181172129771
6274109770	Over the past several months I have joined with leaders in the labor, environmental and business community to talk about the damage Fast Track Authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have on Connecticut families.\n\nCommonly called #TPP, this trade deal is an agreement with 11 other nations that is unprecedented in its scope. It has been negotiated in a secretive manner, with little input from members of Congress who work on the issues at stake—environment, worker rights, food safety and intellectual property. Fast track authority would enable the bill to be rushed through Congress without any ability for it to be changed.\n\nLet’s be clear – this deal makes it easier for big corporations to send middle-class jobs overseas where labor is cheaper.\n\nThe proposed trade agreement would have a devastating impact on American jobs and wages, and I will not support a bad trade deal for the American people, especially one that limits public scrutiny.	10153176005659771
6274109770	Happy St. Patrick’s Day. Wherever you go and whatever you do, may the luck of the Irish be there with you!	10153159089359771
6274109770	Last week, I re-introduced the National Infrastructure Development Bank Act, a bill I have long supported.  Creating such a bank will be a central part of how we grow our economy in a way that works for businesses, families, and the middle class.  \n \nA National Infrastructure Bank will help unlock funding for vital transportation, environmental, energy, and telecommunications upgrades. It will look at each project on its merits, and fund those that will deliver the greatest economic, environmental, and social benefits at the lowest cost to our citizens.\n\nWe must invest in our nation by building better infrastructure systems, creating good middle-class jobs and providing an economic spark to our economy.	10153072320074771
321618789771	I'm about to kick off today's Facebook Q&A. I look forward to hearing from you!	10152846300324772
6274109770	42 years ago, the #SupremeCourt delivered a landmark decision protecting women's health and reproductive rights. While it was a truly historic moment – the fight is far from over.\n\nTime and time again, Republicans in Congress have introduced legislation aimed at undermining this constitutional right.  I believe this is wrong, and I will never back down from protecting a women's right to make her own personal health decisions with her clergy, her family and her doctor. #rowvwade	10153027341689771
6274109770	For years I have been fighting for a comprehensive agenda to address the economic issues facing women and their families. Last night I was pleased to hear the President talk about the profound impact those policies would have on Americans struggling to get by. Paid sick days, paid #familyleave, and #equalpay should be a given for all workers. \n\nThe President laid out a bold vision in his #SOTU for how we can grow our economy and ensure the success of America’s middle-class families.	10153024827204771
6274109770	I am looking forward to President Obama's State of the Union speech tonight, and am urging the Republican Majority in Congress to support legislation that puts in place common sense policies that make American workplaces more healthy, fair and family friendly. #SOTU	10153023329599771
6274109770	I am so pleased to see that President Obama has announced that he is directing federal agencies to give employees up to six weeks of #paidleave after the birth or adoption of a child, a benefit that I believe should be extended to all American workers.\n\nI applaud this measure, and appreciate the President’s endorsement of the Healthy Families Act, which I first introduced in 2005.  The Healthy Families Act would allow workers across the United States to earn up to 7 paid sick days a year and would create a $2 billion incentive fund to help states pay for family leave programs.  This is a critical step toward meeting the health and financial needs of working families.\n\nThis is not a partisan issue -- this is a family issue, an economic issue.	10153023327019771
6274109770	Wishing you and your family a very Happy Thanksgiving.	10152866111019771
6274109770	Happy Veterans Day. Thank you to all those men and women who have served to protect our country, and our freedoms.	10152834531159771
6274109770	Thank you to the people of Connecticut's Third Congressional District. Your trust, support and most of all your friendship means so much to me.	10152820988299771
6274109770	Tomorrow is #ElectionDay, and voters will head to the polls to decide – do we move forward on the critical issues that create jobs and restore the middle-class, or do we say, everyone is on their own. \n \nI believe we need leadership that will work to restore the conditions of long-term prosperity and create good, middle-class jobs. I believe we must make government work for people.\n\nTomorrow is our chance to do just that. Polls across Connecticut open at 6:00am and close at 8:00pm.  Please #vote!	10152816972224771
6274109770	Proud to kick-off rallies across the District this weekend full of so many volunteers working to encourage people to vote in Stratford, Milford, the Valley, Wallingford, Hamden, West Haven, New Haven and in every town across Connecticut. Let's #GOTV.	10152815843374771
6274109770	The issues we are discussing in this election are larger than any one candidate or political party – they are about the vision for the future, and how we move Connecticut and our country forward.\n\nI believe we must have an economic agenda for working women and men. I believe we should make college more affordable, raise the minimum wage, and ensure healthcare is accessible and affordable for everyone. Hard working families deserve better child care, paid sick days, family leave, and equal pay for equal work for women.\n\nThis is what I will continue to fight for, and hope you will join me in voting with these values on Tuesday, November 4th.	10152807191214771
6274109770	As I talk to people across Connecticut, I hear clearly that hard working families are still trying to make ends meet in this economy. Nothing is more important than our economic growth and job creation here at home. I believe we need American jobs, jobs that cannot be outsourced.\n\nLet's make the investments that create jobs, grow the economy, and help the middle-class. On Tuesday, November 4th, let's vote with this in mind and get back to family centered-economics.	10152807184244771
6274109770	Wonderful to see my friend Nathan at the Orange Country Fair, and talk with folks across the district this weekend.	10152710443219771

6274109770	On the Fourth of July, America comes together to celebrate the history and democracy that our great nation is founded upon. #IndependenceDay is a time to honor the patriots who fought for, and individuals who continue to protect our freedom.	10152522268369771
6274109770	Today’s decision by the #SupremeCourt is a serious step backwards for women’s health and will negatively affect not just women, but their families.\n\nHealth care services for women should not be up for debate. The idea that a corporation’s rights should be placed above the rights of women is outrageous, and wrong.	10152519656259771

292076514228382	Honored to participate in Flag Day ceremonies in Waterbury and Meriden this weekend.	582707698498594
292076514228382	I voted against Fast Track because it does not prevent currency manipulation, and does not do enough to support American workers, or preserve environmental, public health, and consumer protections. Trade policy should add American jobs and raise, not lower, American wages.\n\nMy priority remains advancing polices that create jobs, support workers, and raise wages in Connecticut. Trade initiatives should be developed in ways that do not put American workers at a competitive disadvantage around the world. We cannot afford to replicate the past free trade framework that expedited the offshoring of American jobs and put downward pressure on wages for working men and women. I will continue to advocate for U.S. trade policies that level the playing field for American workers and incentivize investing in jobs here at home.	582070831895614
292076514228382	This weekend, I attended Catherine's Butterfly Party in Newtown. The community was able to honor Catherine Hubbard's memory by adopting pets and supporting the development of the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary.	580953985340632

292076514228382	Proud to be #WearingOrange today with my colleagues and staff to honor the 30,000 loved ones we lose every year to gun violence. On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, and every day, we must commit ourselves to stop this epidemic. Did you wear orange today?	579489468820417
292076514228382	Great day in the northwest corner today! Toured Thorncrest Farm and Milk House Chocolates, a family-owned dairy farm in Goshen that produces their own artisanal chocolates. After, I stopped by the Cornwall Consolidated School and spoke with an 8th grade class that recently sent me letters with their opinions on things happening in Congress. In the afternoon, I met with local leaders to discuss opportunities for federal funding for rural communities.	577195445716486
292076514228382	Today, we remember the men and women who paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom. We commit to honor their memory, to care for their families, and to be worthy of their sacrifice. Let us not forget the special pain of those families whose loved ones are missing in action. They deserve closure and dignity as well.\n\nOn this day of solemn remembrance, we reflect on the nobility of those who died to secure our freedom, and thank all who have served and who are serving our great nation. You deserve our eternal gratitude.	576333039136060

292076514228382	This morning, I visited a Connecticut Department of Labor apprenticeship program at Plumbers & Pipefitters Local 777 in Meriden. Apprenticeship programs are critical in preparing the next generation of workers for in demand, good-paying jobs. I had a great time on the tour—and even got to solder some metal!	572518949517469
292076514228382	Great conversations and beautiful weather at my Congress On Your Corner in Thomaston this afternoon.  Thanks for stopping by!	572085076227523
292076514228382	Having an excellent day in New Milford and Danbury.

292076514228382	Made a few great stops today to kick off Small Business Week. First, I toured Farmington Displays Inc, a third generation family-owned business in Farmington that designs and manufactures custom displays. Later, I visited the newly opened Dulces Cupcake Cafe in New Britain and picked up some tasty treats!	570849856351045

292076514228382	Today, I toured the Ball & Socket Factory in Cheshire, which is currently under renovation as a new arts space. I’m working hard in Congress to encourage and incentivize redevelopment and investment in brownfields and former industrial sites, like the Ball & Socket Factory. That’s why I just introduced a bipartisan bill in Congress to help jump-start community revitalization and create jobs.	569024503200247
292076514228382	From robots to yes, even stress tests, I had lots of fun at Simbury's first ever Innovation Fair!	568784173224280

292076514228382	Today, I visited Boehringer Ingelheim, which employs 2,700 people in Connecticut. I toured their new pilot plant, a research facility that will bring medication to market faster and help save lives. I also heard directly from workers about the importance of strong, predictable federal research funding. It's one reason why I voted against the harmful House Republican budget, which would gut federal biomedical research funding. While we need to work towards a smarter, leaner government, drastically cutting these critical and life-saving investments moves us in the wrong direction.	563224740446890
156024857781159	This week more than ever, we’re reminded of the importance of those serving our country. It was with great pride that I recognized our Service Academy Nominees today. I know these young men and women will continue to make Delaware proud.	955106391206331
156024857781159	Remembering my friend Beau today.	953523424697961
156024857781159	Tracey and I are heartbroken. It's one of those times when you imagine if you try hard enough, the news somehow won't be true. There are no words deep enough to express our sense of loss, and there are certainly no words meaningful enough to express our sympathy to Hallie and the children, to Joe, Jill, Hunter, Ashley, Valerie, and all the family. Beau had a warm and generous spirit. He was a truly giving person, and he appreciated the good in others in the way we all should. He leaves a legacy of service, and also a great personal legacy that calls on each of us to be more gentle in our judgments and more gracious with our thanks. He was one of the best of the good guys.	953323161384654

563532937006022	Next Tuesday, I will introduce my amendment to ensure that no funds in the housing appropriations bill go to government housing assistance for illegal aliens. We should not use your hard-earned money to prioritize and reward those who break our laws.	1155948284431148
156024857781159	Today, I joined Senators Carper and Coons in speaking with students from across Delaware at our annual Congressional Youth Conference. I had a great time listening to their ideas and answering some very thoughtful questions. I’m glad we got to speak with so many bright, young Delawareans about the future, and I look forward to seeing what they accomplish in the years to come!	947038582013112
156024857781159	Thanks to Capital One and Communities in Schools of Delaware for letting me stop by this week’s mentoring session.  It didn't take long to see that your work is helping these students find the right path.  Thank you!	934455653271405

156024857781159	Yesterday, I visited Bill Perkins and the amazing staff at one of Delaware’s many “Code Purple” emergency shelters. These shelters provide homeless Delawareans with a warm place to stay when the temperature is dangerously low. It’s going to be extremely cold over the next couple of days, and it’s important that we spread the word and stay vigilant to help those most in need. I encourage you to visit www.delaware211.org or call 2-1-1 if you or someone you know is in need of shelter.	906613366055634
156024857781159	Yesterday, I joined U.S. Secretary of Veteran Affairs Bob McDonald and Senator Coons at the Annual Veterans Summit hosted by Senator Carper. It was a great opportunity to discuss how we can better serve veterans and their families. I would like to thank Delaware’s veterans and their families for their tremendous sacrifices and service to our country. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to honor our commitments to veterans and members of the Armed Forces.	905034252880212
156024857781159	Glad I had the opportunity yesterday to visit with these three Delawareans interning at the National Museum of American History. Wishing them the best of luck for the rest of their time in DC!	886782548038716
156024857781159	Honored to host Cigna employee, and fellow YMCA member, Dan Eason as my guest to the President’s State of the Union tonight.  Dan and I, as well as hundreds of folks in Delaware, saw firsthand what can happen when we come together in Congress to solve our nation’s problems. Legislation we passed last Congress saved 500 jobs, including Dan’s, at Cigna’s Delaware facility (http://1.usa.gov/1J5LYCz). I hope in the President’s speech tonight we’ll hear more about working together to save jobs and continue growing the economy.	882552291795075
156024857781159	Today, as we reflect on the life and legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I am reminded of something he once said, “Everybody can be great...because anybody can serve.” The best way we can honor Dr. King’s legacy and continue his work is by serving our community, giving back, and working together to make our country a better place.	881822211868083
156024857781159	Yesterday I was sworn in for a third term as your member of Congress. I took the oath of office on behalf of the people I represent -- all of you. I feel privileged to serve our great state, and I was honored that so many Delawareans made the trip for the occasion. It’s great to see familiar faces in DC, and my office is always happy to set up Capitol and White House tours if you’re in town for a visit.	874638735919764
156024857781159	Over the next few days, many of us will be spending time with loved ones, sharing memories, and creating new ones.  As we gather together, please take a moment to remember those serving in our nation's armed forces who cannot come home to be with their families.  Their selfless sacrifice makes our holiday celebrations, and our entire way of life, possible.  Thank you for your service!	864117220305249
156024857781159	Legislation I introduced earlier this year to help the 166th-Airlift-Wing-Delaware-Air-National-Guard modernize its aircraft has been included in the National Defense Authorization Act.

66367876671	MILLER MOBILE OFFICE DAYS TOMORROW FOR \nHOLMES AND WALTON COUNTIES\n\nCongressman Jeff Miller (R-FL-01) today reminded constituents of additional office hours as part of his successful mobile office program. In order to better serve the needs of constituents who are not close to the Congressman’s Pensacola or Ft. Walton offices, special “mobile office” days have been established. Expanding on the idea first used for “veteran’s assistance days”, members of his staff will be manning the office answering questions about problems with federal agencies or issues affecting the First Congressional District.\n\n“This is just another way we can better serve our growing population in Northwest Florida,” Miller said. “We tried the mobile office concept earlier, and we had such an outstanding turnout that we decided to expand the concept and add more dates and locations to the program.”\n\nThe dates and times of the mobile office days are listed below.\n\nWednesday, January 28, 2015\n\n10:00 am - 11:30 am – Holmes County Chamber of Commerce\n106 E.

66367876671	There’s a very simple reason why Americans pause each November to honor the service and sacrifice of those who have worn our Nation’s uniform: our veterans have earned it. If it wasn’t for these heroes, who have fought the forces of tyranny in every corner of world and continue to do so to this day, our Nation would be a very different, unrecognizable place. The brave men and women who have stepped forth to serve America have left an indelible mark on history, securing our Nation’s independence, protecting millions around the globe from the forces of tyranny and defeating our enemies wherever they may lurk. The courage, heroism and ingenuity of our veterans provide more than just strength for our military, they provide strength and motivation for our entire country. That’s why veterans deserve our utmost gratitude and support today and every day of the year.	10152846506946672

As a cosponsor of H.Res. 231, which would establish a Select Committee on POW and MIA Affairs in the U.S. House of Representatives, I remain committed to working with my colleagues to bring our Nation's missing heroes back to the home they sacrificed so much to defend.

66367876671	When a servicemember lays down his or her life in defense of the people and ideals they value most, it is the ultimate act of faith and sacrifice. They will never see the finished product of their work, and they will never reap the rewards of their selfless dedication to their Nation. But in dying for that cause, they do so with the faith that our Nation will thrive for centuries to come. If nothing else, Memorial Day is an opportunity to reflect upon that – to remember that the sacrifice of a few is what has propelled our Nation toward greatness since its inception. While Memorial Day is a natural time to be aware of this, it is not the only time. The valor of those who died protecting our freedoms is something that is always worthy of our deepest admiration.	10152451267016672

563532937006022	Today we celebrate Memorial Day, a day of solemn remembrance for all who have died in defense of our great nation. \n\nThough this day of remembrance is solemn, let us not only say prayers for the fallen but let us celebrate their lives and give heartfelt thanks. While this one day has been designated a day of national awareness and reverence, we should honor these men and women every day for providing the liberties and freedoms we cherish.  \n\nWhat was once called Decoration Day, Memorial Day traces its beginning back to just after the Civil War.  A proclamation by General John A. Logan established the first Memorial Day Observance in May of 1868. Mourners placed flowers on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery. \n\nSince that time, we honor all those who died in every conflict since the Civil War; the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm and the more recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. \n\nSo today, let us give thanks and remember. Let us visit the memorials of fallen heroes and make it a point to aid and comfort widows, widowers, and orphans of the fallen. Also let us not forget the veterans among us who have served honorably and often carry the seen and unseen scars of battle.  \n\nToday at 3pm, I will be observing - like all of you - a moment of silence to pay my respects to our heroes who are not with us, for those who have served, and for those who are currently serving in harm’s way. \n\nMay God bless them and may God bless America.	1149738221718821

Our armed forces faced extreme danger to eliminating the senior ISIL leader, Abu Sayyaf. \n \nThe news of this event comes in light of ISIS’s recent advance to Ramadi and underscores the importance of this mission and others that are aimed at stopping this monstrous organization spread across the world. There are no safe havens anywhere in the world when it comes to evil.	1145859422106701

563532937006022	Tonight, I hosted a discussion and heard from folks who are working with our immigration system the correct way. They are waiting in line, respecting the rule of law and doing what is necessary to become a U.S. Citizen. They should be commended. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. The folks that I talked to tonight are respecting the rule of law and that makes President Obama's illegal amnesty that much more egregious. The President's attempts of amnesty insult those who are trying to become citizens through the correct process. They respect the laws on the books, while the President does not. We need an immigration system that rewards folks who did it the correct way. Our current system is not without fault and I am happy to work with my colleagues on immigration solutions that make it easier for those who want to enter our country legally. Incentivizing illegal behavior is not the way to go.	1110671655625478

464253846966014	Five years ago today, President Obama signed his signature health care legislation into law. Since day one, #ObamaCare has been a profound failure for patients, physicians, and taxpayers. Despite the President's promises, millions of Americans lost the health care coverage and doctors that they preferred, insurance premiums have risen dramatically, and government bureaucracy has intruded on the doctor-patient relationship.\n\nObamaCare is so structurally flawed that it cannot ever be fixed; the only way to completely relieve Americans from this destructive legislation is to completely repeal the law.	873521479372580

464253846966014	The news that the personal information of millions of government employees – including those in sensitive national security positions – has been compromised due to a cyberattack constitutes a massive disaster for American security.    \n\nThe amount of information compromised is staggering, and includes information about private American citizens who never served in a government position.  This is because is information includes detailed forms – known as SF-86s – that are required to be filled out in order to obtain a security clearance.  The form asks detailed questions about the applicant’s personal history, including information about family, friends and neighbors.  The interception of this information (mostly likely, it appears, by China) provides grist for the mill for blackmail, retaliation and espionage.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation and will be holding a public hearing on this matter tomorrow morning at 10 AM.	914289021962492

464253846966014	One of the most pernicious aspects of modern American politics has been the growth of a permanent governing class in Washington that deems itself exempt from living under the same rules as the rest of the American people.  This attitude is inconsistent with the nation's founding ethos and is just plain wrong.\n\nObamaCare mandated that only ObamaCare exchange-based plans could be made available to Congress; Congress responded, not by directing members to sign up for individual insurance exchange plans, but by joining the DC Health Link small business exchange. Congress has 535 members and more than 15,000 employees, yet both the House and Senate submitted applications to the DC small business exchange stating that Congress is a small business that employed less than 45 employees!  \n\nRead more about the investigation into this possible fraud in this week's newsletter: http://bit.ly/1doCXdg.	891882294203165
464253846966014	President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated 150 years ago today.  He is the greatest President in American history not named Washington.\n\nThough he served just one term in the U.S. House and failed to win election to the U.S. Senate in 1858, Lincoln possessed a thorough understanding of, and dedication to, our founding principles that guided his presidency through the nation's stormiest days.  When it comes to defending equality before the law, Lincoln is the gold standard.  When it comes to realizing the American Dream, Lincoln is the quintessential example.  When it comes to articulating the nation's guiding principles in a cogent and succinct manner, Lincoln is unrivaled.\n\nGod bless the memory of Abraham Lincoln.	884469721611089
464253846966014	President Obama has removed Cuba from the administration’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. This decision is a boon to the Castro dictatorship and is in keeping with the President's 'dancing with dictators' approach to foreign affairs.  Not only has Cuba sponsored terrorist activity around the globe, the Cuban government continues to harbor Joanne Chesimard, who is on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists.  \n\nThis decision was based on ideology, not facts. Since the Cuban regime has not changed, Congress needs to ensure that all sanctions related to the terror designation remain in place.	884322498292478
464253846966014	President Obama has said that criticism of the Iran nuclear framework "needs to stop," but I believe it is important to highlight the framework’s deficiencies for the American people.  It bestows international legitimacy on Iran’s nuclear program, provides the Iranian regime a huge infusion of cash that will allow Iran to foment terrorism abroad, and incentivizes other Middle Eastern nations to engage in a dangerous nuclear arms race in what is already an extremely volatile region.  \n\nThis cannot be permitted.  \n\nI will be leading a Special Order on the House floor at approximately 8 PM this evening to discuss this critical national security issue. You can watch live on C-SPAN or at http://houselive.gov/.	883844235006971

464253846966014	“We know that [the Iranians] don’t need to have an underground, fortified facility like Fordow in order to have a peaceful nuclear program.  They certainly don’t need a heavy-water reactor at Arak in order to have a peaceful nuclear program.  They don’t need some of the advanced centrifuges that they currently possess in order to have a limited, peaceful nuclear program.”\n\n --Barack Obama, December 7, 2013, Remarks to the Saban Forum\n\nUnder the terms of the framework announced last week, Iran retains all of these assets.  The U.S. simply caved to Iranian demands.  \n\nOh, and about that “peaceful” nuclear program: Iran sits on hundreds of years’ worth of oil and gas reserves and they have no need for any nuclear program but for the desire of the Ayatollah to obtain nuclear weapons.  By allowing Iran to maintain both an underground bunker facility as well as a heavy water reactor (which is a source for plutonium), this deal legitimizes Iran’s nuclear program and paves the way for Iran to develop the bomb.	880307898693938
464253846966014	Did you know that a recent report has revealed that nearly 30% of detainees release from Guantanamo Bay return to jihad?\n\nPresident Obama continues to put our nation’s security at risk by releasing terrorists from Guantanamo Bay. The return of detainees to terror is the dangerous, but foreseeable, outcome of the administration’s policy.  \n\nCongress must take action to protect the homeland and prevent recidivism by holding detainee-receiving nations accountable. That is why today I introduced the the Guantanamo Bay Recidivism Prevention Act. \n\nIf a foreign nation accepts a released detainee, along with the responsibilities of monitoring that detainee, and that detainee returns to terror activities, my legislation will cut off foreign aid.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton has introduced the Senate companion and it is my hope that Congress will pass this bill to help prevent recidivism.	874921169232611

464253846966014	The acquisition of nuclear weapons by a state dedicated to a jihadist ideology is not acceptable.  Iran should not be permitted to have any nuclear energy, yet the deal being pressed by the Obama administration would pave the way for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.  \n\nI applaud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for making the case against this deal before a joint meeting of Congress today.  Israel is a staunch ally of the United States and we share a mutual interest in preventing Iran from expanding its influence and exporting jihad throughout the Middle East.\n \nCongress needs to reject this deal and impose tough sanctions on Iran.  Iran will not abandon its nuclear program unless the costs of keeping it outweigh the benefit that Iran would get from acquiring a nuclear arsenal.	862858650438863
464253846966014	Today the purportedly 'independent' Federal Communications Commission did President Obama's bidding and muscled through a massive power grab that will subject the internet to government regulation.  It is no wonder that the 322 page regulatory morass was kept secret from the public until the members of the FCC cast their votes: regulating the internet as a public utility will trigger a 16.1% tax on broadband usage.  \n\nThe actions of these unelected bureaucrats will harm future innovation and will reduce competition in the marketplace. #NetNeutrality	860553627336032
464253846966014	Most Americans support the creation of quality new jobs and infrastructure.  President Obama has included himself as a supporter of jobs and infrastructure, yet his veto of the Keystone XL pipeline demonstrates that this was just hollow rhetoric.\n\nObama's veto is political theater designed to curry favor with left-wing activists.  It is affirmatively harmful to the thousands of (mostly blue-collar) workers who would be put to work by the project's completion.  The Congress should override Obama's veto.	860132060711522
464253846966014	In the U.S. Code, the third Monday in February is set aside to commemorate the birthday of George Washington, yet this has evolved into an unofficial “Presidents’ Day.”\n\nThis is too bad.  Washington was one-of-a-kind and deserves the special recognition that the federal statutes afford him.\n\nIn modern America, Washington is at the same time ubiquitous and under-appreciated.  On the one hand, his name is honored by the federal District of Columbia, numerous universities, and a state in the Pacific Northwest.  His likeness adorns our currency and the monument to him in the nation’s capital is by law the tallest structure in the federal district.\n\nOn the other hand, Washington’s legacy seems to have little influence on modern political debates.  Any Republican worth his salt will invoke the principles of Lincoln or Reagan with regularity; Democrats look to Wilson, FDR and LBJ for intellectual support in pursuing their agenda.  Yet, one would search in vain to find very many political leaders citing George Washington as an authority on the issues of the day.\n\nThis is much more a poor reflection on us than it is on Washington. \n\nWashington’s sterling political character is without peer in American history.  Commanding a victorious revolutionary army during a time in which winning generals were expected to assume power for themselves, Washington instead surrendered his sword to the civilian Congress and retired to his Mount Vernon home.  How many triumphant generals throughout history would have made such a selfless decision?\n\nWashington's willingness to refuse power was essential to the creation of a republican system of government based on law and in which no individual is indispensable.\n\nHe understood that constitutional government was preferable to the monarchies that governed Europe, and he dedicated himself to supporting and defending the Constitution.  In his Farewell Address, a true tour de force, Washington stressed the importance of preserving America’s constitutional arrangements: \n\n“It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into different depositaries, and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern; some of them in our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit, which the use can at any time yield.”   \n\nTo study Washington's example is to understand his greatness and to agree that what was often said about him in his day is true: first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.	855463357845059

When a President exceeds his authority and usurps the constitutional power of Congress, the proper response is for Congress to use the power of the purse to check the executive branch.\n\nI think it is also important to force every member of Congress to go on record about the negative consequences of Obama’s edict.  To this end, I have been working with my colleagues to offer amendments that target specific aspects of Obama’s executive amnesty, such as:\n\n1. Amendment to protect American workers.  Issuing work permits to illegal immigrants, a key aspect of Obama’s executive action, will harm U.S. workers because illegal immigrants are exempt from ObamaCare’s employer mandate, which means businesses can hire them at a substantial discount (roughly $3,000 per employee) relative to an American.  This is not acceptable.  \n\n2. Amendment to protect legal immigrants.  When Obama issued his mini-amnesty decree in 2012 for those who claim to have illegally entered the United States as minors, the DHS devoted a lot of resources to administer the program, so much so that the wait times for legal immigrants skyrocketed.  These wait times kept families apart, especially for those Americans seeking to bring a foreign spouse to the U.S.  This is not acceptable.  No legal immigrant who is abiding by the law should be disadvantaged due to Obama’s executive decree benefitting illegal immigrants.\n\n3. Amendment to protect the public safety.  Memoranda issued in conjunction with Obama’s executive amnesty announcement by DHS set out enforcement priorities regarding removal of individuals illegally in the country.  Incredibly, DHS policy is to treat some convicted sex offenders and child molesters as a “second tier priority” for removal.  If someone is in the country illegally and gets convicted of a sex offense, especially an offense against children, how can DHS do anything other than immediately send him back to his home country?  This recklessly puts the public safety at risk.       \n\nThis is an important constitutional moment.  The people's house needs to support and defend the Constitution by standing up for the rule of law and the separation of powers.	837561902968538
464253846966014	A lot of folks dislike John Boehner.  People see the country chafing under the thumb of an aggressively left-wing president, yet view Boehner as someone more concerned with his tan and placating K St. interests than in advancing a conservative agenda and stopping Barack Obama.   \n\nI get it.  \n\nAfter all, from the CRomnibus to various bailouts and spending bills, I have consistently opposed Boehner's policies on the floor of the House -- often times placing myself in a lonely minority within my own party.  This hasn’t exactly earned me a warm place in the hearts of the GOP leadership.\n\nNevertheless, I declined to participate in a coup plot against Boehner that failed today by 11 votes.  The plot was ill-conceived, ill-executed and designed to fail.  In my judgment, there was no chance that Boehner would be "fired" but the foreseeable failure of the coup will in fact serve to further marginalize conservatives within the House GOP at a time when we most need conservative energy in the House and Senate to check the Obama administration.    \n\nWhen the GOP Conference held elections for leadership nominations in November, not a single Republican stood up to challenge Boehner as the GOP nominee for Speaker.  He was nominated by acclamation.  I owe nothing to John Boehner as an individual, but I do owe a due regard to the collective judgment of my Republican colleagues for the nominee they selected.  Had we nominated someone like Trey Gowdy during our November conference elections, I would expect my more liberal colleagues to show a similar regard for him on the House floor.\n \nIf the goal is to have a more principled, conservative speaker, I also question the wisdom of engaging in a haphazard floor fight.  Boehner had an 11 vote cushion, but even if that cushion magically disappeared, the chance that a second ballot would lead to the emergence of a more conservative speaker was simply nonexistent.  The strategy depended on the arrival of an elusive white knight on the second ballot because there was no viable alternative at the outset.   \n \nNow, Louie Gohmert and Ted Yoho are both fine men, but they have as much a chance to be elected speaker of the House as I do replacing Derek Jeter as the shortstop for the New York Yankees. Gohmert only received 3 votes while Yoho received 2. \n\nI like Daniel Webster but he announced his candidacy an hour before the vote and never contacted me at all.  I had no idea what he planned to do; all I could do is look at his record, which includes a lifetime FreedomWorks score of 63%, which is lower than Boehner. My lifetime score is 93%. \n\nThe conservative alternatives who would have a chance to garner majority support against Boehner are Paul Ryan, Jim Jordan, Trey Gowdy and Jeb Hensarling -- all not only declined to run but publicly endorsed Boehner.  Even assuming Boehner might have stopped fighting on a second or subsequent ballot, the likely beneficiaries of the coup would not have been these conservatives who had no interest in running but rather ambitious members who are less conservative than Boehner – members that few Americans have ever heard of but who possess a following among the GOP Conference and could potentially be in power far longer than the aging Boehner.  \n\nSome have suggested that members are "scared" to oppose Boehner because we are worried about losing our plum committee assignments.  Well, I do not have plum committee assignments in the first place -- I do not sit and have no desire to be on any "A" committees that are coveted by some members for their prestige and fundraising possibilities.    Furthermore, I was never contacted by, nor discussed the vote with, any member of leadership.  I was promised nothing and was not threatened with anything.\n\nAt the end of the day, the coup attempt fell woefully short because conservatives failed to mobilize an alternative for our November GOP Conference leadership election.  Engaging in the political equivalent of Pickett's Charge will not erase this failure.	833656916692370
464253846966014	Merry Christmas to you and your family!\n\nThe holidays are wonderful time to take a moment and reflect on the many blessings that we share as Americans. While you are celebrating at home today, please keep in mind the thousands of men and woman serving our nation abroad. We must never forget that it is their sacrifice that makes it possible for us to enjoy a free and peaceful holiday season.	823397364384992
464253846966014	American Alan Gross - imprisoned by the Castro regime for 5 years - has just arrived on U.S. soil.\n\nAlan Gross was unjustly imprisoned by the Castro dictatorship and his return is long overdue.  I am happy for him and his family.  I am dismayed that, in exchange for the release of Gross, the Obama administration agreed to release imprisoned Cuban spies who conspired to kill Americans, as such an action legitimizes the Castro regime's coercive tactics.  This prisoner swap sends a signal to rogue regimes and actors that taking an American hostage can be leveraged into scoring policy concessions.  This makes America less safe and emboldens the dictatorship in Cuba.   \n\nReports suggest that the Obama administration will also unilaterally relax sanctions on Cuba, even though 11 million Cubans still chafe under Castro's tyranny.  The goal of U.S. policy should be to liberate these hostages from the oppressive Castro regime, not to reward the regime with relaxed sanctions.	818573178200744
188572961157305	While the House passed several good and necessary tax relief and IRS accountability and transparency bills this week, the fact is that our entire code is overdue for a complete overhaul. I supported these targeted bills but remain focused on advancing comprehensive reform that simplifies the code, and trades loopholes enjoyed by special interests for lower rates across the board. \n \nI have co-sponsored the Tax Code Termination Act, which abolishes the entire current tax code ten years from enactment if Congress doesn't initiate comprehensive reform. Actions speak louder than words and this bill would force Congress to stop talking about tax reform and start working on your behalf.	1043591688988757
464253846966014	Honored to announced that Chairman-elect of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Republicans, Congressman Jason Chaffetz, has named me Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security for the 114th Congress\n\nThe federal government's core responsibility is to protect the security of our nation and the American people. Yet, from the release of terrorist detainees by the Defense Department to habitual failures of the Department of Homeland Security regarding border security, the bureaucracy has fallen short of what the American people expect. I am thankful to Chairman-elect Chaffetz for tapping me to lead this subcommittee, and I look forward to working with him and the rest of the committee's members to hold our national security agencies accountable on behalf of the American people.	818069581584437

188572961157305	The employer mandate placed a stumbling block in front of businesses that wanted to expand and hire, and resulted in lost wages and fewer working hours for existing employees. The President’s decision to delay this portion of his own bill demonstrates that even he now acknowledges what Americans have warned from the start: Obamacare is unworkable, unaffordable and harms our economy. \n\nUnfortunately, no delay except a permanent delay, and no waiver except full repeal, will prevent the Obamacare train wreck from happening.  That is why we must protect individuals, families and businesses – large and small – from Obamacare’s mandates, while remaining focused on clearing the way for patient centered reform that promotes access to the care you need, from the doctors you choose, at a cost you can afford. \n\nThe Obama Administration listened to big businesses. Now it is time to listen to individuals, small businesses and families. After all, if big businesses get a break from Obamacare, don’t you deserve one too?	678869272127669

But for those families who have given their own friends and loved ones in sacrifice for that freedom, it can also be especially bittersweet.  So as we all find a quiet moment amidst the sunshine, the bountiful harvest, and the sound of our children laughing and playing, we should reflect on those who are no longer with us and also those who stood up to serve and are now stationed far from home.

For over forty years, Bill Young has been one of America's strongest advocates.  He has worked tirelessly to better this country and to look out for all Americans - most especially our troops.  He was always a gentleman and to so very many people, a true American hero.  I sought his counsel every chance I could get.  His insight on the issues before us was second to none.  His service to this country, his good nature, his strong character, and his tireless wisdom will be sorely missed by all of us.  My prayers go out to his family and his many, many dear friends."	712397342122678

So to all those who served and continue to serve this great country, we thank you.  We appreciate your service and your sacrifice.  \n\nHappy Constitution Day.	694964417199304

Congress doesn't always get things right, but designating such a day was without question one of the things they did get absolutely right.  And on this day, if you have a moment, please remember to keep our men and women in uniform in those prayers.  It means an awful lot to them and to their families.	626610080701405

183541871674897	Seventy one years ago today, America was under attack at Pearl Harbor.  That day changed the world and changed history forever.

183541871674897	Eleven years ago today, the United States of America was under attack.  Before that day was over, thousands had lost their lives.  Were it not for the selfless acts of heroism by our first responders, who rushed toward the danger as others rushed away from it, the toll would have been far worse.  So on this day, as on all days, please take a moment to keep those first responders in your thoughts and prayers. Please also remember the brave men and women of our Armed Forces and the families who stand behind them.  These individuals VOLUNTEER to put themselves in harm's way so that the rest of us may live in freedom and safety.  We truly owe you everything we have. \n\nThank you for your service.	512054708823610

712496765463007	This week, I had the pleasure of meeting Olivia Olson of Shorecrest Preparatory School in St. Petersburg, as well as Sofia John of Dunedin Highland Middle School. These bright students are in Washington to represent Florida in the National History Day competition, a year-round academic program that encourages students in grades 6-12 to engage in original historical research. Olivia and her partner, Sophie Elwyn, created a documentary called “Poynting the Way: The Leadership and Legacy of Nelson Poynter,” which was inspired by their mutual interest in journalism, while Sofia and her partners, Alexandra & Kristin Shanabrook,  produced a performance titled “The Zimmermann Telegram and President Woodrow Wilson: Broken Alliances, Espionage, and the Catalyst of World War I”. Congratulations to all of these students on a job well done! #NHD2015	934493529929995
712496765463007	Today I voted against Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), or 'fast-track', for two reasons.  First, I have genuine and broad disagreement with the President's view of government and his view of how to grow our economy and create jobs.  Thus, I am very concerned about the priorities the President may pursue in a multinational agreement and, respectfully, the impact the President's decisions would have on American workers and American job creators. \n\nSecond, I believe the process for TPA approval was considered too quickly and did not provide enough time for the American people, for the community I represent, to fully consider the proposal and have a thorough discussion regarding whether we as a country are prepared to enter into a new and historic trading partnership with Pacific nations.  The best decisions are made when everyone has an opportunity to understand the issues, consider the impact of significant policy decisions, and engage with their elected officials on what each of us believe is the right direction for the future of the country. \n\nExpanded trade, responsibly and fairly implemented, can create jobs and economic growth for Americans of all communities and all walks of life.  But sometimes the best of ideas, pursued at the wrong time, make for questionable policy making.  While expanded trade will undoubtedly be a part of our American future together, today's Trade Promotion Authority bill was the wrong decision at the wrong time.	931657520213596
712496765463007	It was a pleasure meeting with some Pinellas County students yesterday visiting DC with SCUBAnauts International (SNI).

I have no doubt these students will be our nation’s next experts in the marine sciences.  Thank you for visiting, and enjoy the rest of your time in DC!	931277556918259

712496765463007	Today I helped announce the St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport has been awarded a $5.745 million in FAA funds for its Apron Hardstand Project. The project includes the demolition, removal, and replacement of the existing pavement surfaces used to park commercial aircraft. \n\nThe St. Pete.-Clearwater International Airport is an economic engine and tremendous asset to  Pinellas County, helping local businesses while providing a gateway for families and tourists looking to visit the a area. In fact, passenger service at the airport continues to grow, reaching record levels. This federal grant will help ensure the airport is prepared to safely meet the demand for increased service in the coming years.	923130877732927
712496765463007	I am pleased to have announced on this Memorial Day that I've introduced the Student Veterans Housing Support Act, legislation designed to improve housing opportunities for veterans pursuing education after serving their country.\n\nThe measure, H.R. 2465, makes improvements to the monthly housing stipend payable under the Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nCurrently, veteran students face lapses in their educational housing allowances when school is out and temporary employment to make up the difference is hard to come by on such an inconsistent basis.  Veterans, particularly our combat veterans returning from war, face enough obstacles as they transition back into civilian life.  For those trying to earn their degree, unstable housing allowances make it even harder.\n\nIn simple terms, this bill gives veterans the financial support they need to remain in school by extending their monthly housing stipend to cover semester breaks, including the summer months and the time immediately before and after a semester.  It’s a simple move that ensures veterans receive the support they deserve in return for all they have sacrificed.\n\nI am also happy the Student Veterans Housing Support Act is already being applauded by those in higher education.\n\nSt. Petersburg College President Bill Law said the legislation would remove roadblocks for the more than 2,100 veterans, active military members and military dependents at St. Petersburg College. He noted earning a degree is a life-changing event, and was pleased with our efforts to assist our veterans in their educational pursuits.	922675764445105

712496765463007	This week I was able to secure House appropriations language providing $10 million for a new Gulf of Mexico fisheries research program to be managed by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The NMFS Southeast Regional Office is located in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe funding, upon enactment, would be used for a new third-party data collection effort for Gulf of Mexico fish populations like Red Snapper, dramatically increasing the contribution of data from the recreational, charter boat, and commercial sectors.\n\nThis is significant as many in the fishing community, from recreational, to charter, to commercial, have questioned the government’s stock assessment. This will give each of them a seat at the table. Third-party data collection will continue to improve the information available to the government and improve the data behind decisions related to fishery closures. It will improve our knowledge of fisheries stocks and if the research shows a larger fish population than the government suggests, this will open the door for a longer fishing season for species like Red Snapper. And a longer Snapper season is an economic and quality of life win throughout our community, positively impacting everyone from local scientists committed to the protection of fish populations, to recreational anglers, to charter operators, to businesses that are dependent on fishing tourism like hotel and restaurant operators.\n\nThe measure was met with widespread support from all sectors of our fishing community, the research community, and from economic development and business leaders. As Frank Chivas, the owner of Baystar Restaurant Group said, “this is a huge step forward for better and faster data, which allows better management, which gives all fishermen access to more fish.”\n\nThe $10 million is included in the Fiscal Year 2016 House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Bill. The bill was approved by the subcommittee Thursday.	918624718183543

712496765463007	In 1962, President John F. Kennedy marked May 15th as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as Police Week.  \n\nTo help honor our local officers during Police Week we reached out to several Pinellas County elementary schools and asked the students to write cards or letters that we could then deliver to local law enforcement agencies.  \n\nThis afternoon, I’ll be delivering the hundreds of letters we collected.  But each day this week, I will also share a few of the cards with you.\n\nAnd thank you again to all those who serve and protect our communities!	917029291676419

181810465190906	During my community one-on-one session in Ruskin today at the HCC Southshore campus, student leaders advocated for Pell grants, work-study and affordable textbooks. I am on their side in the budget battles ahead as a college education is vital to future success in life.

181810465190906	Republican hypocrisy is on full display this week as they bring up two tax bills in Congress that increase the deficit by nearly $100 Billion.  Congress has a “Pay As You Go” rule that requires tax expenditures and new initiatives to be paid for.  Republicans simply “waived the rules” and are hoping that no one is paying attention.  Sorry, but almost $100 Billion added to the deficit is hard to miss!	841150869256859
181810465190906	Yesterday I had the great honor to recognize the extraordinary contributions of Lew Williams and Gwen Reese by presenting each with a Congressional Record.

181810465190906	Today I sent a letter to U.S. Health & Human Services Secretary urging rigorous federal oversight of FL’s egregious, systematic failures to provide adequate health services to children enrolled in Medicaid.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Egmont Key Alliance, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and Florida State Parks gave me an outstanding view of the Tampa Harbor dredging and sand placement on the Key. The sand will stabilize the historic resources, provide improved habitat for wildlife and save money as the sand doesn't have to be deposited offshore. Keeps Port Tampa Bay traffic moving through a freshly dredged channel as well. For more info:  http://www.saveegmontkey.com	809800245725255
181810465190906	#NoMoreBailouts Buried in the 1,600 pages of the House Republican spending bill is a provision that would put American taxpayers back on the hook for the risky behavior of Wall Street. The provision would repeal an important section of the Wall Street Reform law entitled, ‘PROHIBITION AGAINST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BAILOUTS OF SWAPS ENTITIES.’ This special interest power grab at the end of the dysfunctional 113th Congress does not meet the smell test and puts America squarely in the same spot that led to the meltdown of America’s economy. Instead, I sided with American middle-class families, small businesses and all those who do not want to put America’s economy and its recovery at risk.	807568462615100

469477579757018	Watching the Memorial Day Concert at the Capitol with my family on PBS.  They are giving a great salute to all our Vietnam Veterans.  Those Veterans are the brave souls who never received  the heroes welcome they were due. God Bless all our Veterans and thank you, especially my three brothers who served during that war that painfully taught us so much about ourselves.	897697073601731
469477579757018	On this Memorial Day, let us remember those who have given the ultimate sacrifice. America was founded on the principles of the liberties given to us by God. Among these liberties are the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the freedom to participate in our government, without fear of unjust persecution.\n\nWe have a duty to honor our lost heroes by protecting the freedoms for which they courageously fought—because freedom isn’t free. While today is a day to remember those who died protecting and defending our freedom, every day is a day to thank a Veteran for his or her service. Let us never take them or their sacrifices for granted. #MemorialDay	896381007066671

469477579757018	I had the pleasure today to speak to the great people at MetLife in Tampa. MetLife employs more than 1,700 associates at its Highwoods Campus in Tampa and helps people plan for their future by protecting what matters most: their families and ambitions. MetLife is far more reliable than the federal government in managing risks and protecting families. \n\nIn order to better protect MetLife and similar companies from government strongholds, I introduced H.R. 1550, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2015. This legislation will increase government transparency and help protect financial institutions from being unfairly disallowed to mitigate identified risks within their companies.\n\nThank you to everyone who participated and provided a healthy dialogue in today's informative meeting.	891732367531535

In honor of all the citrus farmers and producers in the 15th District of Florida and throughout the entire State, I want to thank you all for the passion and hard work you endlessly put into keeping the Florida Citrus industry and legacy alive.

469477579757018	Today is one of the most daunting days of the year for a majority of Floridians: #TaxDay. This year, Floridians are filing federal income taxes using a complex tax code that is over 70,000 pages long. Our current tax code is too complicated, slows growth and creates a drag on our economy. A 2012 report from the IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service estimated it took a total 6.1 billion hours for all taxpayers to handle their taxes.\n \nWe must simplify our tax code, period. Today I will join my colleagues in the House of Representatives in passing a number of common sense bills that will rein in #IRSabuse and protect the rights of tax taxpayers’.	881611191876986

469477579757018	Today, I helped pass bipartisan reforms to Medicare that will strengthen this important program for current and future recipients, without raising taxes. Since 2003, Congress has spent nearly $170 billion on 17 short-term patches to the flawed Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) physician reimbursement formula. This legislation replaces the SGR with a system that brings stability to hospitals and doctors that treat Medicare recipients. It also ensures that seniors will continue to have access to their healthcare providers.\n \nThese reforms are critical for health care providers in our community, and I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this legislation before the current SGR patch expires in five days.	872077042830401

Lakeland now holds the largest collection of Frank Lloyd Wright structures in the world.” Go Mocs.	865390070165765

117697790448	I just cast my vote to stop IRS waste and abuse. Our Financial Services Appropriations Bill, which the Committee approved this afternoon, cuts IRS funding by $838 million (a nearly 10 percent cut from FY 2015 levels) and prohibits any IRS funds from being used to implement Obamacare or target groups for their political beliefs. \n\nBy cutting waste and setting priorities, our bill saves taxpayers $1.3 billion while funding important programs that help support America's small businesses. Our bill also fully funds the Disaster Loan Administration program, which provides critical assistance to small businesses in Florida.	10153364884130449

117697790448	Just cast my vote for House passage of an appropriations bill to freeze Congressional salaries for the seventh straight year. Our bill, which funds the legislative branch, keeps in place the 14 percent in cuts to the House's total budget that we've enacted since the GOP took control in 2011.

117697790448	In seven years, President Obama has never proposed a balanced budget. For four straight years, Senate Democrats never passed a budget at all. Today, the Senate passed the balanced budget we approved in the House last week. This is the first time in 14 years that the House and Senate have passed a joint, balanced budget.	10153254885335449
117697790448	I just voted for House passage of a budget plan that balances, protects our children from massive debt, makes the tax code fairer and simpler, saves Medicare, helps grow our economy and create jobs, and provides temporary relief from crippling defense cuts.\n\nHowever, I remain deeply concerned about the impact of sequestration and defense cuts on our national security. The cuts of the last several years have already left our military weaker and less capable of meeting the challenges we face around the world. If we can’t fulfill our most important obligation, keeping our nation safe, then nothing else in this budget really matters. \n\nI’m glad we reached an agreement to prevent another round of deep cuts in 2016, but we know this puts us on track to be right here again next year. The President and Congress, Republicans and Democrats, are all culpable for these defense cuts and the devastating consequences they pose for our national security. We have an obligation to work together and find a long-term solution that restores needed defense funding and ensures our military has the tools and resources it needs to protect our nation.	10153245643770449

117697790448	The Castro regime has failed to demonstrate any fundamental or meaningful change in its policies to warrant its removal from the State Sponsors of Terror list. I am disappointed, but unfortunately not shocked, that the Obama Administration is again choosing opportunistic politics over sound national security policy and compliance with the law. Normalizing diplomacy rewards the Castro regime’s lack of progress and gives the Communist party the means to persist by legitimizing its legacy of mistreatment of the Cuban people. It’s difficult to understand why some U.S. politicians and journalists, who so revere the freedoms they’re afforded by our country, can support sustaining a regime that blatantly denies its citizens the same. I support those Cubans who toiled and died for the right to once again be free. Sanctions should only be lifted when the Cuban government schedules free and fair elections; legalizes the freedom of speech and operations of independent labor unions, political parties, civil society and the press; and frees all of its political prisoners.	10153207363265449
117697790448	Tax week fact: According to a Taxpayer Advocate Service analysis of IRS data, "Individuals and businesses spend about 6.1 \nbillion hours a year complying with the filing requirements of the Internal Revenue Code - and that figure does not include the millions of additional hours that taxpayers must spend when they are required to respond to IRS notices or audits." Time for a fairer, simpler tax code.	10153204004055449

117697790448	Thank you to the Glades Electrical Cooperative for inviting me to speak at Saturday's annual meeting about the impact of over-regulation on energy costs and the need for all-of-the-above energy solutions, including more American energy production.	10153158521615449
117697790448	Important update for veterans: Last year's VA health care reform law included a provision I cosponsored to allow veterans to see private doctors if they live more than 40 miles away from the nearest VA facility. Since that program began, the VA has measured distance "as the crow flies," significantly limiting the number of veterans who have been able to take advantage of the new Veterans Choice program. Today, the VA announced that it will determine eligibility based on driving distance, rather than straight line distance. \n\nThis common sense change is expected to double the number of eligible veterans, and will benefit many veterans in rural areas of Florida's 17th district. If you have any questions about the Veterans Choice program, or need assistance with your VA benefits, please contact my office.	10153156559445449
117697790448	The ATF can’t get its story straight about whether their ammo ban was a ‘publishing error’ or a serious proposal that they shelved due to public backlash, but the White House has been consistent – the President supported the ban, and his Administration will continue working toward unilateral gun control. Whether it’s the ATF, the EPA, or any other agency, Congress cannot allow unelected bureaucrats to take away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.\n\nWe need to keep the pressure on the ATF and the entire Obama Administration. The House should start by taking up my "Protecting Second Amendment Rights Act," which would prevent any federal agency from using ammunition bans as a backdoor to undermine the Second Amendment.	10153125478945449
117697790448	I'll be on Hannity Radio today at 4:30 PM discussing the Obama Administration's proposed ammo ban and my bill to block it. Tune in!	10153121024585449
117697790448	So what's the truth? They mistakenly published a proposal to ban ammo? Was the proposal itself a mistake or just the releasing of it? This is why Congress must pass my "Protecting Second Amendment Rights Act" to prevent ATF or any other agency from "mistakenly" taking away your rights. https://mobile.twitter.com/ATFHQ/status/574029776224186368	10153120963660449

117697790448	I strongly oppose the Obama Administration's proposal to ban the manufacturing and sale of 5.56 mm/.223 caliber M855 “green tip” ammo commonly used for hunting and target shooting. Banning one of the most popular types of ammunition for the most popular rifle in America would rob law-abiding sportsmen and hunters of their 2nd Amendment rights. I have co-signed a letter with many of my House colleagues to ATF questioning this ban and will continue fighting for your 2nd Amendment rights. What do you think of the Obama Administration's proposal?	10153097625565449
117697790448	Does anyone honestly believe that the internet would function better, promote more entrepreneurship, and generation more innovation and growth under the tight control of the federal government? The FCC’s new #NetNeutrality rules represent a blatant power grab, and one dissenting commissioner was right to call the plan “a solution that won’t work to a problem that doesn’t exist.” This fight is not over; we will continue our efforts to protect the freedom of the internet that has worked so well since its inception.	10153095263495449

317735028342371	Proud to greet President Obama to the district with Ft. Pierce Mayor Linda Hudson and thank him for including funding for important Everglades projects in Florida. To raise awareness for the ongoing crisis facing the St. Lucie River and #IndianRiverLagoon, I presented him with a bottle of toxic water collected from local #fl18 waterways. I will continue to work with our leaders to find solutions to end the harmful discharges from Lake Okeechobee affecting our estuary once and for all.	731272326988637
317735028342371	Had a great meeting to discuss important #fl18 waterway issues with Brigadier General C. David Turner, commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, South Atlantic Division.

317735028342371	I was glad to vote for the Drinking Water Protection Act today in the House, which passed with bipartisan support. It would require the EPA to address the risk of blue-green algae in drinking water. I hope its passage will help address the impacts these blooms can have far too frequently in our region.	714578965324640
317735028342371	I am happy to announce that after my office's request, Lake Okeechobee discharges will temporarily stop into the St. Lucie River so that the state of Florida and Martin County can conduct important water quality studies.

112179098816942	Regarding the Framework announced today -\n\nI greet any deal with Iran with great skepticism given its deceptive history and ongoing destabilizing and dangerous activities in the Middle East and around the world. \n\nI remain deeply concerned as to how a number of issues have been addressed in the framework and may be addressed in a final agreement. These include Fordow being allowed to remain open and operating, continued enrichment at Arak, the disposition of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile, whether a verification regime allows anytime, anywhere inspections of all known or suspect sites, the full resolution of the military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program, and the timing of and requirements for any sanctions relief. \n\nI look forward to a full and frank discussion with the Administration on these issues and the questions the framework leaves open, specifically including  the necessary role Congress must play going forward.	938202029547974

112179098816942	Facebook friends, I hope you’ll indulge a long post from me on trade.\n\nFew people know that I grew up in the working class steel town of Bethlehem, PA. I saw firsthand the havoc wreaked on our community when Bethlehem Steel shut down its factory as cheap foreign steel flooded the market. That’s part of the reason that I voted against Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) today. \n\nI get that trade deals can help American corporations succeed abroad. But I cannot support fast-tracking a deal that does little to help low and middle income Americans compete here at home.\n\nFrom a foreign policy perspective, I also agree that the United States cannot afford to create a vacuum of leadership in East Asia. Without American leadership, we risk letting China steer this region in a very different direction, a direction where environmental health is ignored, human rights are trampled, intellectual property is stolen, and workers are unjustly abused.\n\nYet it is impossible to ignore that since enacting fast-track in 1973, corporate profits have soared, worker productivity has more than doubled, and yet Americans’ incomes have barely budged. That’s not right. And if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is not done right, we will be left with another unenforceable agreement that locks in weak standards and a system that fails to spread the benefits of trade to all Americans. \n\nFast-tracking TPP leaves us with no hope of improving it, and that’s why I voted no.  \n \nIt is also important to note that the rules agreed to in the House and the Senate require that Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) passes before TPA can move forward. TAA is the only program that helps the workers most devastated by trade deals like TPP retool and get on their feet. \n \nToday, in a huge vote of 299-126, an overwhelming number Republicans and Democrats voted against TAA. Unfortunately, Republicans voted against TAA because they oppose giving displaced workers any help when their jobs move overseas. Democrats voted against TAA because it doesn’t go far enough to protect workers and ensure that every day Americans and not just corporations benefit from trade deals. \n\nIn the coming days, there will be a debate over TAA and what happens next. \n \nThe worst possible outcome, however, would be that Congress passes Trade Promotion Authority and fast-tracks TPP without any help for those most devastated by it.	974651539236356

112179098816942	Florida ranks 49th in the country for the number of low-income working parents who lack health coverage.

They do, however, qualify for federal Medicaid expansion coverage should our state legislature reach a compromise over implementation. \n\nNationwide about 18 percent of Americans stuck in the coverage gap live in our state. \n\nAre you one of the 800,000 Floridians stuck in the dreaded health coverage gap?\n\nPlease share your story with me. \n\n.	965038433531000
112179098816942	Pleased to let you know that yesterday, the House of Representatives passed my bipartisan bill with Congressman Mark Meadows (R-NC) to target Hezbollah's sophisticated global financial network with sanctions. As a terrorist organization, Hezbollah is second only to Al-Qaeda in the number of Americans it has killed. \n\nHezbollah also continues to transport Iranian weapons to Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad, continues to threaten the security of Israel, and continues to plot terrorist attacks against innocents around the world. \n\nhttp://teddeutch.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398424	959572654077578

112179098816942	Some good and bad news from our nation's highest court today.\n\nThe good news is that the Supreme Court upheld Florida's ban on judges soliciting donations for their election campaigns. Chief Justice Roberts even wrote that this law helps protect us from "the mere possibility that judges’ decisions might be motivated by the desire to repay" their donors. \n\nIn other words, Chief Justice Roberts recognized the value of laws that keep big money from influencing the decisions of our judges. \n\nThe bad news? Chief Justice Roberts still denies the value of laws that keep big money from influencing the decisions of leaders elected by and for the people.\n\nThis decision is yet another reminder that we must pass the Democracy for All Amendment (Udall-Deutch) and amend our Constitution if we want stronger campaign finance laws that hold elected officials accountable.	952542268113950
112179098816942	Today is Yom Haatzmaut, the 67th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel. I am proud to say that it was also 67 years ago, only minutes after David Ben-Gurion announced Israel’s declaration of independence, that the United States recognized the nascent state. Since 1948, our two countries have shared an unshakeable bond.\n\nAs President Bill Clinton once said, "We are proud of the strong bond we have forged with Israel, based on our shared values and ideals. That unique relationship will endure just as Israel has endured."\n\nIndeed, this anniversary marks 67 years in which the only Jewish state in the world has defended itself against attacks from hostile state armies and terrorist organizations. Yet this anniversary also represents 67 years of modernization, innovation, growth, and advancement. As it faces new attacks in the 21st century, most recently taking shape as economic boycotts and delegitimization campaigns, Israel will continue to endure.	949472938420883
112179098816942	This year on Yom HaShoah, we mark seventy years since World War II finally came to an end. Tragically, that end only came after the Nazis' plan to annihilate European Jewry succeeded in sending six million Jews to their deaths.  On Yom HaShoah, we join in memory of those who perished in the Holocaust while recommitting ourselves to advancing justice and meeting the needs of those who survived its unthinkable atrocities.  I pledge to every Holocaust survivor, their families and our community that embraces them that I will do everything I can to ensure their legacy is remembered for generations to come. \n\nOn Holocaust Remembrance Day, let us honor the memory of those we lost by living up to the words “Never Again” and doing everything in our power to conquer hatred, defeat bigotry, and promote respect for the basic human dignity of all.  And let those words guide our actions when addressing any threat to annihilate the Jewish people or the Jewish state.	945863345448509

112179098816942	Today I was pleased to vote for a bipartisan deal to permanently repeal the misguided Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) policy that jeopardizes doctors participating in Medicare, and to permanently extend assistance to low-income seniors struggling to pay their Medicare premiums. \n\nIn addition to building certainty in our Medicare system, this legislation also protects health care for low-income kids and funding for the federal health centers in Florida’s 21st district that in 2013 alone served over 70,000 patients living below or near the federal poverty level.  \n\nToday’s deal is the product of the kind of bipartisan compromise that has become all too rare in Washington, in which neither Democrats nor Republicans get everything they want but come together to move our country forward. I can only imagine how much more we could achieve for the American people if we came together in the spirit of compromise on more issues, from infrastructure investment to immigration reform.	934510793250431

112179098816942	Bob Levinson has been missing for 2,922 days. Eight years after his disappearance, Bob is now the longest held US civilian in history. I joined with my South Florida colleagues Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Mario Diaz-Balart to introduce a House resolution that would ramp up the pressure on Iran to help bring Bob home to his family.\n\nPRESS  RELEASE: On 8th Anniversary of Disappearance, Lawmakers to Ramp up Pressure on Iran to Cooperate in Levinson Case\n\n(Washington, DC) In conjunction with the 8th anniversary of the disappearance of Robert Levinson, Reps. Ted Deutch (D-FL), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) will introduce a resolution calling on Iran to increase its efforts to assist in bringing Bob Levinson home. Levinson, a retired FBI agent and private investigator, went missing from Iran’s Kish Island on March 9, 2007.\n\nHe has now been held for 2,922 days, making him the longest held United States civilian in history. \n\nEvidence that Levinson was still alive and being held captive surfaced in 2010 and again in 2011 when the Levinson family received a video and series of photos of Mr. Levinson, indicating that he was being held somewhere in southwest Asia. \n\n“As the United States and our partners sit across the table from Iran attempting to negotiate an end to its illicit nuclear program, they must continue to raise Bob’s case directly with Iranian leadership. President Rouhani himself pledged Iran’s cooperation in this case, and it is time to fulfill that pledge and bring Bob home to his wife, children and grandchildren,” said Congressman Ted Deutch, who represents the Levinson family in Coral Springs, Florida.\n\n###	924441847590659

112179098816942	Over the past 42 years that abortion has been legal in the United States, our nation has made huge strides towards gender equality. Women are the breadwinners in over 40 percent of U.S. households with children. Women are earning half of all medical, law, and doctorate degrees awarded by our universities. Women are serving in elected office in greater numbers than ever before.\n\nI will always stand up against legislation that threatens to turn back the clock on this progress, and undermine the autonomy that women have over their own bodies, their own families, and their futures.\n\nInstead of attacking the constitutionally-protected reproductive rights of women, we should be working on a real women's agenda in Congress that includes guaranteed paid maternity and family leave for working parents, affordable child care, and equal pay for equal work.	899982493369928

With that said, limiting the funding available to passenger rail projects will not only make All Aboard more expensive to build, it may impose an unintended restriction on important federal investments in transportation infrastructure like Amtrak, Positive Train Control, and other transit services.	459942767497419
138220153003017	Enjoyed speaking to the Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce today to discuss issues impacting South Florida.

138220153003017	A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to travel to Kenya and Malawi with a few of my colleagues and CARE to see first-hand how U.S. foreign assistance investments directly improve the lives of women and girls in Sub-Saharan Africa. Among the good work being done is the provision of education and medicine to HIV-positive mothers and children. I look forward to using what I saw and learned on this moving and enlightening trip to inform my work on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Democratic Women’s Working Group.	459513917540304

138220153003017	I am pleased to have joined my colleagues and women’s advocacy groups earlier today to introduce the fourth pillar of the Women’s Economic Agenda, retirement security. \n\nOur mothers, our grandmothers, our sisters, and our daughters work hard to take care of their families, and they should be taken care of when they get older. That is why retirement security is a part of our economic agenda for women and families. Because when #WomenSucceed, America Succeeds. #MissionPossible	446686088823087
138220153003017	Honored to speak at a local AIPAC – The American Israel Public Affairs Committee meeting today to discuss the importance of strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship as well as preventing a nuclear Iran. In March, I sent a letter to the President with 366 of my colleagues expressing the important role that Congress has played and must continue to play in order to ensure that Iran is not allowed to obtain a nuclear weapons capability. I am pleased to see that the Senate passed legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support that establishes Congressional review of any final nuclear deal with Iran to strengthen our voice in this critical process, and I look forward to it coming before the House next week.	444952348996461

138220153003017	This morning I joined fellow women's health advocates in calling on Governor Scott to veto Florida’s recently passed bill that would make it harder for women to have a safe and legal abortion and urging Congress to pass the Women's Health Protection Act that would invalidate state laws that chip away at women’s reproductive rights. For more information on my bill that would help overturn these restrictive measures, click here: http://1.usa.gov/1GN4yMp	444401029051593
138220153003017	As the mother of a U.S. Marine veteran, I am deeply troubled by the House’s woefully inadequate funding bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs that according to VA Secretary McDonald equates to 70,000 fewer veterans receiving VA medical care.

As the representative of one of the largest Holocaust survivor populations in our nation and the mother of three children, Anne's enduring legacy of hope and perseverance in the face of darkness is one I carry with me every day of my life. We must never forget her and so many millions of our brothers, sisters, and loved ones.	10153414960054122

88904724121	Thank you to everyone who attended my Small Business Workshop today! This was my sixth workshop which is designed to be a "one-stop shop" for prospective and existing small business owners to find the tools they need to start or grow their businesses. Small businesses are  the backbone of our economy in South Florida. I'm particularly proud of all the graduates of my Early Learning Business Institute who have worked so hard in "CEO School"  to improve their business skills so our children can thrive. And many thanks to the South Florida Business Journal's publisher Melanie Dickinson, who presented me with the Influential Business Woman Award!	10153378324984122
88904724121	Wrapped up an amazing, moving, eye-opening, troubling trip to Sub-Saharan Africa with a visit to the Leo Toto Center in Kibera, Nairobi Center, Kenya. They are doing life-saving work educating, counseling and providing vital medicine to HIV-positive mothers and their HIV-positive children. We were able to see and learn about the dramatic improvement in these families' lives. The desperate poverty and high rate of HIV in Kenya, which is 6% of a population of 44 million is an international crisis which I'm proud the United States is helping to relieve. We also visited the Coptic Hospital where the Hope Center is dramatically improving the health of women and children living with HIV. The Bishop and his clergy are among the most compassionate people I've met. @CARE has done truly remarkable work to make a difference in the lives of women and girls. I will take what I learned here back to the U.S. so it can inform my work on the State Foreign Operations Appropriations Committee. #learningtours	10153368731139122
88904724121	Today's Fifth Circuit decision to maintain an injunction on the President's executive immigration actions aimed at keeping families together, is a step backwards that will continue to hurt families all across the nation and Florida. The President's actions fall well within previous executive actions on immigration by presidents of both parties. President Obama's actions would provide compassion and much-needed clarity to millions of our neighbors, family and friends. Instead, the decision of two judges in one circuit continues to pull families apart and allow a broken system to remain that way. I will continue to fight for common sense immigration reforms that keep families together and make us safer as a nation.	10153363897924122
88904724121	Incredible visit with @CARE through their #learningtours to Nsala Village, Lilongwe District in #Malawi today.  We learned about the Feed the Future program and how it helps mothers learn about the importance of the six food groups and how to feed nutritious food to their children so they can thrive! As a member of the State Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, I am the sponsor of the 1,000 Days resolution which stresses the need to focus on the first 1,000 days of a child's life to give them every chance to get the best possible start.	10153361338839122

I was also honored to hear from officials at ICE who help make this program the best it can be. Thank you to my colleague Ted Poe for his work on the HERO Act, and I urge the House to bring up for a clean vote the JVTA bill that will make this invaluable program permanent.	10153330168589122

88904724121	I wish the State of Israel a sincere mazel tov on her 67th anniversary. The United States and Israel have shared a special bond since before Israel’s independence. Our shared histories of fighting for independence based on democratic values are just part of what makes this relationship strong and unshakable.\n\nAs the first Jewish woman elected to Congress from Florida, my support for Israel is a core part of my personal and professional life. As a member of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, I will continue to advocate for the United States diplomatic and military commitments to Israel. In a hostile world and dangerous region, our nations must and will continue to have a strong and strategic relationship rooted in our core values of democracy, human rights and justice. \n\nAs we do each year, we commemorated Yom Hashoah with a special ceremony in the Capitol honoring victims and survivors of the Holocaust, reminding us of the vital role Israel plays for the Jewish community and for the world. Mazel tov again to the people of Israel on your Independence Day, and may we continue to go from strength to strength.	10153282941194122

88904724121	Today is Equal Pay Day – the date that marks how much longer into this year a woman must work, on average, until her earnings match what a man earned the previous year for doing the exact same job. Women make on average 78 cents for every dollar earned by men, amounting to a yearly gap of $10,876 between full-time working men and women. $10,876 could purchase: 86 more weeks of food; or more than 3,200 additional gallons of gas; or 12 more months of rent. Our working families need and deserve Equal Pay now!	10153258344499122

148299805224565	Do you have any snow photos from the 2014-2015 winter season that you would like to share?\n\nRead below to learn more:\n\n--------------------------------\nStrange Weather, Stranger Behavior\n\nMassachusetts is no stranger to snow, but the amount we’ve had in the past month is plenty strange. My hometown of Worcester has broken snowfall records. As I write this, Worcester is the snowiest city in the nation with 115 inches (compared to the norm of 56 inches). Four of the five snowiest months in Worcester’s history have occurred since 2005. These major storm events are becoming more and more common. Clearly, something strange is in the air.\n \nIn true New England spirit, we’re not letting the snow get us down. Instead, we’re using it as an excuse to let loose. Students in Cambridge are having fun climbing the five-story Alps of MIT, one man used this as a chance to popularize the sport of Snow Swimming, a bunch of folks decide to jump out of windows, and the rest of us can sit back and enjoy a rousing (but frosty) edition of “Here Comes the Sun” or just take the opportunity to ski around town.\n \nAt the same time, some are embracing the snow by playing fast and loose with the facts. Looking for any excuse to confuse the public on climate change, some are citing this cold weather as undeniable proof that the climate isn't changing - that we’ve somehow hit the pause button on global warming. This results in the comically oversimplified view that climate change means no cold weather anywhere, even in the winter in New England.\n \nThe truth here might be stranger than fiction, because global warming can sometimes lead to more snow, not less. This year’s extreme snows provide a persuasive example, as scientists have explained. These storms were amplified by the warm atmosphere and exceptionally warm ocean waters. It starts with basic physics: warmer air can hold more moisture, and more moisture means heavier precipitation. There’s even more to it than that, though, as recent research shows that the strange split between the hot, dry West coast and the cold, snowy East is a product of a weakened jet stream, which scientists say is a byproduct of the warming Arctic.\n \nIn short, climate change leads to all kinds of strange weather extremes - from heatwaves and drought to super typhoons to record-breaking snowfall.\n \nIf we don’t control our emissions, it’s true that some places would eventually become too warm for snow. Meanwhile, that warmer (but still seasonally cold) air will be capable of stockpiling more and more moisture before dumping it on us in massive storms like the ones we’ve experienced this year.\n \nWhile that means more fun in the snow, that fun comes at a steep price. Not only do these big storms knock down power lines and shut down workplaces (which hurts individual income and company productivity) but they also take a major toll on city budgets. For example, Worcester has spent $5.34 million on snow removal, with January’s snow alone costing the city $1.5 million. This week, City Manager Edward Augusts Jr. requested that the City Council authorize the City to spend $1.6 million over the $4 million budgeted for snow removal. Lawrence budgeted $150,000 for snow and ice removal, while early estimates before the Valentine’s storm suggested the cost of cleanup will reach $1 million. On the whole, January’s snow could cost the region up to $1 billion.\n \nThis major tangible cost to city and state budgets makes the GOP’s climate denial particularly strange. As a party that routinely touts the gospel of fiscal responsibility, how do they justify ignoring the ever-rising costs of climate change? Similarly, as the party that’s big on national security, isn’t it strange that they’re ignoring what the Pentagon considers a major national security risk?\n \nAll of this strange weather has given plenty of folks an opportunity to demonstrate strange behavior. I’d say that the GOP’s climate change denial fits into that category, but given their oil and gas campaign contributions, perhaps this denial is not so strange.\n\n---------------------------\n\nDo you have a photo of the recent snowstorms that will convince the GOP that climate change is real? If you do, show me the snow!\n\nSend an original photograph with your name, the date the photo was taken and where it was taken to mcgovernpics@gmail.com.\n\nThe photo must be from the MA 2nd Congressional District.\n\nAll photos must be submitted by Sunday, March 22.\n\nEligible photos will be posted on a "Show Me The Snow" facebook album beginning March 23.	807110256010180

119538428117878	This week, the House strongly confirmed its commitment to support key American values by denying U.S. exports to the Cuban military, and ensuring that the property claims of Americans are respected.\n\nThe House issued two strong rebukes of President’s Obama’s absurd policy toward Cuba which turns a blind eye to U.S. law and channels resources to the Cuban people’s oppressors.  The Farr Amendment to CJS, which would have allowed direct exports to the Cuban military, was rejected by a vote of 153-273, and the Barbara Lee amendment to THUD, which would have allowed the use of confiscated properties for new flights and the docking of marine vessels, was rejected by a vote of 176-247.  The House unequivocally voted to stand with the Cuban people and uphold the core American principles of liberty and the rule of law.\n\nOn December 17, 2014, President Obama stated, ‘I believe that more resources should be able to reach the Cuban people.’  Certainly supporting the Cuban people does not include channeling goods to the oppressive Cuban military and intelligence services, nor does it include facilitating the unlawful use of stolen properties that were illegally confiscated from Americans.  President Obama purports to ‘help’ the Cuban people through policies that actually empower and fund the Cuban military and intelligence services that oppress them, and while facilitating the trafficking of stolen property.\n\nRegrettably, President Obama has turned a blind eye to U.S. law and longstanding U.S. policy which prohibits tourism dollars to the Castro regime and expressly protects Americans’ property rights.  The House today strongly expressed its support of U.S. law, its full intention to continue to uphold core American values, and ensuring the respect of both human rights and property rights.\n\nhttp://mariodiazbalart.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/historic-bipartisan-votes-in-house-reject-president-obama-s-policy-of	848732451865135

203456549678362	A few more thoughts on Rep. Geisinger's passing...\n\nWhen I was elected to the Georgia Legislature in 1984, there were only 26 Republicans. It was very difficult and frustrating to try to get anything positive accomplished. Harry Geisinger was actually part of an even smaller class of Republicans years before me. I can only imagine how tough it was on him, but- to show you his influence- Speaker Tom Murphy still referred to him years after he'd left the House, calling him "Geese"-inger. Even though he was gone from the Legislature, the threat he posed to Democrats was still relevant.\n\nMost modern day Republicans can't appreciate how tough it was in those days to stand up for conservative values and small government. We've got a lot of work ahead of us, but we've come a long way, and a lot of that progress is thanks to Harry Geisinger.\n\nFor the media to sum up his legacy as a horse-racing proponent dismisses his true political significance. Nonetheless, I'm sure he was watching Victor Espinoza ride to victory yesterday.	984783474878995
203456549678362	Rep. Harry Geisinger was a true trailblazer. He was fighting the small government fight before it was popular and before many of us were even born. Our state, our country and the world have lost a great man.	984309258259750

We look forward to hearing firsthand the thoughts and concerns of the Israeli people. Israel is our greatest ally in the Middle East, and we must stand with them in this time of great challenges.	10153033768200421
148299805224565	Strange Weather, Stranger Behavior\n\nMassachusetts is no stranger to snow, but the amount we’ve had in the past month is plenty strange. My hometown of Worcester has broken snowfall records. As I write this, Worcester is the snowiest city in the nation with 115 inches (compared to the norm of 56 inches). Four of the five snowiest months in Worcester’s history have occurred since 2005. These major storm events are becoming more and more common. Clearly, something strange is in the air.\n \nIn true New England spirit, we’re not letting the snow get us down. Instead, we’re using it as an excuse to let loose. Students in Cambridge are having fun climbing the five-story Alps of MIT, one man used this as a chance to popularize the sport of Snow Swimming, a bunch of folks decide to jump out of windows, and the rest of us can sit back and enjoy a rousing (but frosty) edition of “Here Comes the Sun” or just take the opportunity to ski around town.\n \nAt the same time, some are embracing the snow by playing fast and loose with the facts. Looking for any excuse to confuse the public on climate change, some are citing this cold weather as undeniable proof that the climate isn't changing - that we’ve somehow hit the pause button on global warming. This results in the comically oversimplified view that climate change means no cold weather anywhere, even in the winter in New England.\n \nThe truth here might be stranger than fiction, because global warming can sometimes lead to more snow, not less. This year’s extreme snows provide a persuasive example, as scientists have explained. These storms were amplified by the warm atmosphere and exceptionally warm ocean waters. It starts with basic physics: warmer air can hold more moisture, and more moisture means heavier precipitation. There’s even more to it than that, though, as recent research shows that the strange split between the hot, dry West coast and the cold, snowy East is a product of a weakened jet stream, which scientists say is a byproduct of the warming Arctic.\n \nIn short, climate change leads to all kinds of strange weather extremes - from heatwaves and drought to super typhoons to record-breaking snowfall.\n \nIf we don’t control our emissions, it’s true that some places would eventually become too warm for snow. Meanwhile, that warmer (but still seasonally cold) air will be capable of stockpiling more and more moisture before dumping it on us in massive storms like the ones we’ve experienced this year.\n \nWhile that means more fun in the snow, that fun comes at a steep price. Not only do these big storms knock down power lines and shut down workplaces (which hurts individual income and company productivity) but they also take a major toll on city budgets. For example, Worcester has spent $5.34 million on snow removal, with January’s snow alone costing the city $1.5 million. This week, City Manager Edward Augusts Jr. requested that the City Council authorize the City to spend $1.6 million over the $4 million budgeted for snow removal. Lawrence budgeted $150,000 for snow and ice removal, while early estimates before the Valentine’s storm suggested the cost of cleanup will reach $1 million. On the whole, January’s snow could cost the region up to $1 billion.\n \nThis major tangible cost to city and state budgets makes the GOP’s climate denial particularly strange. As a party that routinely touts the gospel of fiscal responsibility, how do they justify ignoring the ever-rising costs of climate change? Similarly, as the party that’s big on national security, isn’t it strange that they’re ignoring what the Pentagon considers a major national security risk?\n \nAll of this strange weather has given plenty of folks an opportunity to demonstrate strange behavior. I’d say that the GOP’s climate change denial fits into that category, but given their oil and gas campaign contributions, perhaps this denial is not so strange.\n\n---------------------------\n\nDo you have a photo of the recent snowstorms that will convince the GOP that climate change is real? If you do, show me the snow!\n\nSend an original photograph with your name, the date the photo was taken and where it was taken to mcgovernpics@gmail.com.\n\nThe photo must be from the MA 2nd Congressional District.\n\nAll photos must be submitted by Sunday, March 22.\n\nEligible photos will be posted on a "Show Me The Snow" facebook album beginning March 23.	807013799353159
366739521606	Today was a win for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (#SHEP) as House approved the conference report to H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (#WRRDA).

82737208404	It was with a heavy heart and great sadness that I learned of the passing of Mr. Joseph "Beau" Biden III, a devoted father, a loving husband, a son who made his parents so proud, a brave and faithful veteran of the war in Iraq, and a public servant who was beloved by the people of Delaware. My heart reaches out in prayer to his wife Hallie, his children, Natalie and Hunter, his mother and father, Jill and Joe, and to his brother and sister.\n\nHe was so young and so full of promise; it is almost unthinkable that he is no longer here. Yet I hope the Biden family can find some comfort in knowing that his example and his goodness touched the lives of so many. He leaves a legacy of honor and dignity that many more who live much longer never achieve.  Beau Biden will be deeply missed.	10153274676623405
82737208404	Wishing each and every mother a happy Mother's Day. Thank you for all that you do.	10153208327633405
82737208404	47 years ago this evening, Walter Sheridan pulled me aside and said, “John, we just got word that Dr. King has been shot in Memphis.”	10153128203228405
82737208404	Fifty years ago tonight, President Johnson delivered to the nation one of the most meaningful and powerful speeches any American president ever delivered before a joint session of Congress. That night, he poured out his soul, his heart, in proposing the Voting Rights Act, and then before the closing of the speech he said, “And we shall overcome.” I was sitting next to Dr. King watching the speech on television, and when President Johnson said those words I looked over at Dr. King and watched a single tear roll down his cheek. We knew then that it was just a matter of time —the Voting Rights Act would be passed.	10153081432338405
82737208404	Be hopeful. Be optimistic. Do not become bitter or hostile. Love is a better way.	10153050965323405
82737208404	Today, the FCC took historic action to protect a free and open Internet for generations yet unborn. It would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of hundreds and thousands of activists, leaders, and ordinary citizens who made their voice heard. All too often, those in power measure progress in dollars and cents, but today's decision by the FCC weighs the human costs.	10153041342823405
82737208404	I’m pleased to support the Protecting the Integrity of Medicare Act (PIMA). This bill contains many bipartisan, common-sense policies that will help protect and strengthen Medicare. One of these improvements is the Medicare Employer Relief Act. I was proud to introduce this legislation with my friend and colleague, Rep. Dave Reichert.  \n\nOur bill is simple. It saves time and money. This legislation relieves employers from outdated Medicare paperwork and fines. As a result, it will help make employer-sponsored health insurance work better for everyone. And many Americans, who are covered by employer sponsored health insurance, will benefit from these common-sense changes.	10153040992063405
82737208404	Thank you for all of the kind birthday wishes. I have to say, 75 feels very good.	10153030286338405
82737208404	I am deeply disappointed that the House GOP will vote today for the 56th time to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act. There is so much more to be done, we cannot waste time playing political games.	10152989221663405
82737208404	If we had the technology, if we had the internet during the movement, we could have done more, much more, to bring people together from all around the country, to organize and work together to build the beloved community. That is why it is so important for us to protect the Internet. Every voice matters, and we cannot let the interests of profit silence the voices of those pursuing human dignity. I have long supported strong Net Neutrality protections, and I am deeply grateful that President Obama has called on the FCC to pass rules that will protect the internet for generations yet unborn.	10152979170588405

82737208404	President Barack Obama made an appeal to Congress tonight in an uplifting and inspiring speech.  I am glad that he took the time to describe some of the successes of his administration, which are not discussed often enough.  There is no question that when he took over our economy was teetering on the brink of depression.  Today it is also clear that he has guided this nation out of grave difficulty toward a more stable, steady economic course.  But this President is not satisfied with that success.  He is still pushing Congress, coming up with policy ideas, and extending his hand in partnership hoping to make the kind of progress that will touch every American, not just a few.	10152962046043405
172032960420	I’ll be sharing my thoughts on the President’s State of the Union Address tomorrow morning LIVE on C-SPAN. LIKE and SHARE and be sure to watch at 7:10am.	10153032067165421

82737208404	Right now, on the Floor of the House, we are going down the same unfortunate road again. The bill is a deliberate and systematic attempt to undermine the Affordable Care Act. It would roll back protections for Americans who work at or near forty hours a week. Before the Affordable Care Act, it was easier to discriminate against the sick, the elderly, and those who have lost their job through no fault of their own. But those days are over. We will not go back.	10152936055418405
82737208404	I am deeply troubled by the bombing in Colorado. It reminds me of another period. These stories cannot be swept under the rug #NAACPBombing	10152931512908405
82737208404	What happened in Paris is a threat to free speech, not just in Europe, but all around the world. Nothing justifies the murder of journalists or cartoonists.	10152929161378405
82737208404	Sen. Edward Brooke (R-MA) was the first African American elected to the Senate since the Reconstruction, and he was one of a kind.  He was never partisan or wedded to party interests.  He was a champion for whatever he believed was right.  He was instrumental in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and added an important open-housing requirement to the act.  He also crafted the Brooke Amendment a year later which capped the financial responsibility of public housing applicants to no more than 25 percent of a poor person’s income.\n \nSen. Brooke’s charismatic presence, his intellect, integrity, and his impeccable manners, helped him rise above the limitations of race and party politics in a quest for a just and free society.  He became the gold standard for politicians who followed his rise to power.  Sen. Brooke made a lasting contribution to our society because he was a persistent and consistent voice for social justice, a champion for those who are left out and left behind.  He will be deeply missed.	10152908835293405
82737208404	Mario Cuomo was one of the bright lights of the Democratic Party. His voice will be deeply missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.	10152898086148405
82737208404	Wishing everyone a happy and safe New Year. Let us join together in resolving to do all that we can to make this world a little more just and a little more peaceful.	10152893266653405
82737208404	When we see something that's not right, not fair, or not just, we have a moral obligation to speak up and speak out to do something about it.	10152883847618405

82737208404	I mourn for the loss of these two young police officers. I mourn for their families, and I mourn for the citizens of New York. These two young men were executed. I pray for them, their families, and our nation. Nothing justifies the murder of a police officer. These are the people we call on when we are in trouble and when we need help.	10152868865528405
82737208404	There is no place for violence in a civilized society. We must work together to create a world at peace with itself.	10152851407948405

82737208404	On this Thanksgiving Day, let us be thankful for all that we have, for those who we love and for those who love us. Let us remember all that we have to give and commit ourselves to being generous in spirit, not just today but each and every day, never ignoring the plight of those left out and left behind.	10152812635843405
82737208404	I know this is hard. I know this is difficult. Do not succumb to the temptations of violence. There is a more powerful way. Only love can overcome hate. Only nonviolence can overcome violence. #FergusonDecision	10152807000318405
172032960420	This morning it was widely reported that our economy shrank last quarter by 0.7%. After more than six years of President Obama’s higher taxes and out-of-control regulatory schemes, we have an economy that remains weak and plagued with uncertainty. And all his administration is proposing is more of the same – more taxes and more government-made barriers to growth and opportunity. This new normal is unacceptable. \n\nThat is why we need the President to work with this Congress that has put forth a balanced budget and pro-growth policies that will spur desperately needed growth.	10153348756840421
172032960420	Today's jobs report reflects a disturbing trend of an alarmingly small workforce participation rate and economic stagnation. The balanced budget that the House recently passed would hold government accountable, encourage real job growth and a thriving workforce. The President ought to realize that working families are the answer, not bigger government.	10153200721960421
172032960420	The president and his team are out touting their latest next step in ongoing negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. We ought to be wary of any deal or “framework” that merely puts Iran’s nuclear program on hiatus – particularly when Iran continues a public posture of outright hostility toward our strongest ally in the Middle East, Israel and US interests in the region. The administration seems irresponsibly eager to lift sanctions and is putting an unhealthy level of trust in Iran to abide by inspections and enforcement. Congress must be given a chance to review any final agreement.	10153198429915421
172032960420	The House Budget Committee has passed the FY 2016 budget resolution, A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America - The committee’s approval of our balanced budget proposal follows months of honest discussion and debate in consultation with our colleagues in the House to put forth a package of positive solutions. We look forward to bringing our budget to the Floor next week for consideration by the full House of Representatives.	10153165178505421
172032960420	The House Budget Committee has announced that we will be holding our Members' Day hearing on February 25th. This is an opportunity for members of the entire House of Representatives to share, in an open forum, their thoughts and ideas for our FY 2016 budget proposal. Building our budget must be a collaborative effort, and I look forward to hearing all of the creative ideas my colleagues have about how to address our nation's fiscal and economic challenges.	10153082064400421
172032960420	We lost Alan Nunnelee, a dear friend and Congressman from Mississippi, today - and America lost a hero. Our thoughts and prayers are with Tori and family. God Bless.	10153071433065421
172032960420	The House passed two measures this week, H.R. 50 and H.R. 527, to increase transparency at regulatory agencies so that they are forced to consider the impact their directives have on states and small businesses across the country. \n\nJob creators and hard-working families have experienced the slowest recovery from an economic downturn in modern history due in no small part to an overactive regulatory regime at the federal level. It is imperative that we ramp up accountability across the board and shine a light on the number of unfunded mandates that are handed down from Washington in order to recognize and hopefully mitigate the damage that’s being done. It’s an important part of creating an economic environment conducive to growth and opportunity.	10153068338910421
172032960420	President Obama will deliver his State of the Union address tonight. Our hope is that the President will indicate some willingness to work together with Congress to find innovative solutions for our economic and fiscal challenges. What do you want to hear from the President in his address to the nation?	10153031274500421
172032960420	As the lead cosponsor of H.R. 25, the FairTax Bill, I’m excited that this year we have the most members cosponsoring the bill than ever before on the first day of a new Congress. My friend and Georgia colleague Congressman Woodall should be commended for his leadership on this issue. We must continue to propose innovative solutions to create a tax code that is simpler and fairer for American families and businesses.	10153008320900421
172032960420	Yesterday evening, the House passed -- with overwhelming bipartisan support -- a bill to encourage the hiring of more American veterans. The Hire More Heroes Act lifts burdensome Obamacare regulations that are currently standing in the way of our veterans finding jobs. We ought to do what we can to assist our service members as they return to civilian life. This is an important part of a larger effort to support economic growth and opportunity while working towards our goal of a full repeal of Obamacare.	10153003331750421
172032960420	Reminder to catch me on C-SPAN “Newsmakers” TODAY at 10am and 6pm where we discuss the role the House Budget Committee will play in crafting solutions for the fiscal and economic challenges facing our nation.	10152937656425421
172032960420	TUNE IN to C-SPAN “Newsmakers” this Sunday. In an interview that will air at 10am and 6pm, I join Greta Brawner of C-SPAN, Damian Paletta of the Wall Street Journal and Andrew Taylor of the Associated Press in a discussion about the fiscal and economic challenges facing the nation. We focus on the role the House Budget Committee will play in helping craft solutions to move the country forward in the new year. LIKE, SHARE, and set your DVR now so you don’t miss it!	10152932815640421
172032960420	President Obama's announcement today of changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba is the latest example of this administration's disturbing tendency to try and curry favor with brutal, oppressive regimes who don't share our values or commitment to individual freedom while alienating our allies who do. It's neither diplomatically shrewd nor in the best interests of those within these nations who desire to live in a free and open society.\n\nWhile we raise these concerns and look to get more answers about the Administration's actions, we welcome and are thankful for the news that Alan Gross has been returned to his family.	10152926784530421
172032960420	Yesterday I joined Consul General of the Republic of Korea, Seong-jin Kim and Korea’s Minister of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, Park Sungchoon to lay a wreath for our Korean War Veterans. We owe our humble gratitude to those who have fought to defend our country. Please visit Johns Creek Veterans Memorial to give thanks and honor our veterans.	10152919177700421
172032960420	With great reverence I joined Wreaths Across America to honor our Georgia military families today. We are forever grateful for their commitment to our nation, especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom.	10152917607190421
172032960420	Today the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report on the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program. The release of this report will put American lives at risk. There is absolutely no question that we need robust and honest oversight of our intelligence community and the actions they take to protect and defend the American people. However, the manner in which this report has apparently been compiled and now released clearly doesn’t meet that standard.	10152908681720421
172032960420	Wishing you a happy Thanksgiving filled with food, family and fellowship! May you have much to be thankful for today and always. Let's also take this time to remember those in our community who need our thoughts and prayers this holiday season and those brave men and women who are protecting and defending our great nation.	10152881488400421
172032960420	Had a great discussion with students from Cambridge High School this morning. I’m so impressed by their thoughtful questions!	10152875853110421
172032960420	Sec. Hagel – whose resignation as Secretary of Defense was announced this morning – should be commended for his lifetime of service to our nation. What’s needed now as ever is an honest debate over the Obama Administration’s floundering foreign policy. Left unaddressed, it will only foment more unrest and instability around the world and put in jeopardy America’s security and our national interests.	10152875551325421
172032960420	All who seek peace and an end to violence in the Middle East must condemn the terrorist attacks that killed four innocent civilians – including three Americans – in Jerusalem today. The horrific contrast between the peaceful act of prayer of the victims and the brutality of the violence against them underscores the heinous nature of this attack. The victims, their families, and our Israeli friends and allies are in our thoughts and prayers.	10152863373915421
172032960420	So thankful to have had the opportunity to join Mayor Bodker, Consul General of the Republic of Korea, Seong-jin Kim and our veterans at the dedication of the Johns Creek Veterans Memorial Walk. I hope that if you have the opportunity, you will go enjoy the memorial and honor the selfless and courageous veterans who keep our country safe and free.	10152854085855421
172032960420	It was an honor to visit with seniors and WWII veterans at Elmcroft of Roswell. If you have a chance to visit with a WWII veteran, take time to chat and thank them for their service!	10152840619310421

172573036140374	On this day 71 years ago, Allied Forces led by brave Americans stormed the beaches of Normandy in defense of liberty. Their remarkable service and sacrifice protected the freedom of untold numbers across the world, and we're forever grateful.	973647306032939

172573036140374	Today, I supported two House-passed pieces of legislation that move us closer to efficient, accountable, and long-term solutions for America. H.R. 2250, the “Legislative Branch Appropriations Act,” is the third Appropriations Bill passed by the House this year, and holds the line on the spending reductions and accountability measures we've worked to implement. H.R. 2353, the “Highway and Transportation Funding Act,” will prevent disruption in projects across the country and provide a path for crafting a long-term solution to America's infrastructure needs. One step at a time, you and I are making Washington more accountable and more effective.	964629466934723
172573036140374	Providing for America’s national defense is Congress’ most important responsibility, which is why today I supported H.R. 1735, the “National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).” NDAA ensures our military and intelligence community will have the tools they need to do their jobs and that the mechanisms are in place for them to succeed.  With your help, America’s new Congress continues to make progress towards a more efficient and accountable government, and I ask you to please contact your U.S. Senators and urge them to partner with us and send this important legislation to the President for signature.	961684173895919
172573036140374	Today, I voted in favor of H.R. 1191, the “Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act,” which ensures Congressional oversight of any nuclear agreement made with Iran, as well as prevents the President from unilaterally lifting sanctions. On an issue as critical as this, we cannot allow the voice of the American people to be excluded from the process - and with overwhelming support in both the House and Senate - I’m eager to see this legislation now move to the President’s desk for signature.	960791603985176
172573036140374	Thanks again to the more than 1,200 folks who came out for Service Academy Day on Saturday, and all those who worked to make it such a success.  With the remarkable young people we have in the Seventh District and throughout the State of Georgia, I’m confident America’s best days are ahead.	958727480858255
172573036140374	Wishing my mother and all mothers throughout the 7th District a wonderful Mother’s Day! You hold a special place in our hearts!	957092011021802
172573036140374	This week I was fortunate to visit with great students and staff at several schools across the Seventh District. I always look forward to these opportunities, but during Teacher Appreciation Week, it was especially inspiring to witness the level of dedication provided by our educators. Thank you for hosting me this week, and thank you for all you do for our community.	956989621032041
172573036140374	It's National Small Business Week, and while we take the opportunity to celebrate America’s entrepreneurs and job-creators during this time, it is clear the positive impact they have on our community goes far beyond just one week out of the year. Thank you to all who are willing to put your ideas into action and make the Seventh District such a great place to live, work, and play.	954987721232231
172573036140374	The progress in Washington continued today as we successfully passed the first joint ten-year balanced budget resolution since 2001. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), this agreement contains over $5 trillion in savings and $400 billion in additional economic growth over the next 10 years. Our work is only just beginning, but I’m excited to see America’s new Congress returning to the process our Founders intended, and restoring results over rhetoric.	952050341525969
172573036140374	Today, I managed the rule for debate on 2 Appropriations bills – H.R. 2028 – FY2016 Energy & Water Appropriations, and H.R. 2029 – FY2016 Military Construction & Veterans Affairs Appropriations.  In recent years, this important process was stifled by Harry Reid’s refusal to allow the Senate to act, but with a new Republican majority and willing partner in the Senate, we in the House began the Appropriations process earlier than has been done in over 40 years.  America’s new Congress is committed to results, and one step at a time, you and I are moving Washington closer to a more effective and accountable government.	951310964933240
172573036140374	The first 100 days of America’s new Congress have been busy, but we have moved the ball forward on many of  the issues that matter to American families.  Congress passed the first real entitlement reform in decades to help shore up Medicare for our seniors, and in the House we passed multiple bills accomplishing goals like restoring the middle-class work week eroded by Obamacare, promoting American energy production, caring for our veterans, preventing further IRS misconduct, and reforming our tax code.  The list goes on, and there is much yet to do, but one step at the time, you and I are moving America closer to a more efficient, effective and accountable government.	943914722339531
172573036140374	Happy Passover to all those celebrating!  May it be a wonderful time for you.	936130143117989
172573036140374	Easter is a time of renewal, and for many of us, the celebration of a promise fulfilled. I hope it is a joyous day for you all.	936018899795780
172573036140374	On this Good Friday, many of us will reflect on our faith and the sacrifice made for our renewal.  I hope it is a blessed time for you and your family.	936013853129618
172573036140374	The United States and Israel share a bond much greater than politics, and I hope you’ll tune in this morning at 11AM to hear Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu address a joint meeting of Congress.  You can stream the speech live here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhqT1oT5xn0	915547701842900
172573036140374	With another round of winter weather making its way through the area, the deadline for 7th District high school students to submit artwork for the Congressional Art Competition has been extended to this Friday, February 27, at 10 a.m.  If you have any questions, please call my office at 770-232-3005.	912332168831120
172573036140374	By vetoing the Keystone XL pipeline authorization today, President Obama said “no” to the American people; as well as to the jobs, energy security, and reduction in daily living costs that the bill would provide.  Republicans and Democrats alike came together and found a way to say “yes,” but sadly the President chose not to join us.  America’s new Congress is committed to getting things done on behalf of the American people, and while I do not know whether the Senate has enough votes to override the President’s misguided veto, I hope that it will try in the near future.	911894235541580
172573036140374	Effective and accountable government starts right here at home when the community is involved in the process.  Thanks to the Kiwanis Club of Duluth & Norcross, and Rocket IT for taking the time to visit with me this week on the issues that matter to you.	909575522440118
172573036140374	Due to the winter weather and school closings this week, the deadline for 7th District high school students to submit artwork for the Congressional Art Competition has been extended to 5 PM on Wednesday, February 25.  If you have any questions, please contact my office at 770-232-3005.	909228095808194
172573036140374	While the winter weather has made it an interesting week, I hope you’ll still be able to join me tomorrow (Thursday) night at 7 p.m. in the Gwinnett Justice & Administration Center for a Town Hall Meeting.  Hope to see you there.	908648239199513
172573036140374	Bit by bit, you and I are moving America in the direction of more efficient, effective, and accountable government.  This week the House passed H.R. 527 and H.R. 50, which will help hard-working small business owners serve our communities without being hassled by the federal government. Bolster the efforts by calling your Senators and ask them to encourage McConnell to bring these bills to the floor.	901578883239782
172573036140374	On February 3, 1913, Delaware ratified the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, granting Congress the ability to tax income. For 102 years, Washington has used this power to manipulate the behavior of the American people. The FairTax would return that power to the people.	900759019988435
172573036140374	Regulatory uncertainty is damaging to all industries, and today the House took action to correct one of these issues.  H.R. 351 requires that the Dept. of Energy provide a timely ‘yes or no’ response to all applications for the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG).  The demand for energy abroad creates jobs here at home, and this bill will help prevent slow-moving bureaucracy from standing in the way of these American jobs.	897405590323778
131177916946914	The United States is the most influential country in the global economy.  In order for the U.S. to maintain that position, it is necessary that we continue to expand our trade partnerships throughout the world.   Free trade opens new markets to America’s agricultural and industrial producers and allows our economy to expand, which means more jobs right here at home in Georgia’s Eighth Congressional District.  Our country is home to the best and the brightest workforce, and in order to negotiate the best agreements for the American worker, Congress must have a seat at the table.  Trade Promotion Authority includes stringent measures for offering checks and balances to the President throughout the trade negotiation process, and empowers Congress to make decisions on each agreement.\n\nI know there has been a lot of back and forth on this issue, so I want to take the time to discuss what TPA is and what it is not.  Congress has granted TPA to every president since 1974. TPA itself is not a trade agreement.  However, the legislation will allow Congress a seat at the negotiating table when discussing trade agreements, effectively allowing Members of Congress to represent their districts’ trade interests. For the first time, it requires the President to make any trade agreement (like TPP) public for 60 days before it can be submitted to Congress for a vote. TPA has been available to the public and has never been secret. In fact, you can read it here: https://goo.gl/R90CPV\n\nTPP is a trade agreement that is currently being negotiated. We did not vote on TPP this week.  Yesterday, I had officials from USTR in my office to discuss TPP with me so I could ask questions face to face.  I read through portions of the current version of TPP- it is 800 pages long- and I will continue to review it as it is negotiated. I understand some are concerned about its classified status, and I agree. Bills of this magnitude should be transparent. The final version of TPP will be publicly available.  I was not in Congress when Obamacare was rammed through without anyone having read it's 2,000 pages. This is why I joined a task force to create a health care alternative that is open for debate and amendments from both sides of the aisle and that legislation is only 195 pages long. You can read it here: http://goo.gl/CrLuBO\n\nWe are a country of checks and balances. Our Constitution clearly lays that out.  Trade agreements should be no different. Trade is important to our state and to our district –89% of our state’s exporters are not big business companies; they are small- and medium-sized companies with less than 500 workers.  Expanded markets are great for Georgia’s farmers and manufacturers. While our state is one of the top agriculture states in America, our scope reaches beyond our shores.	931311653600199
131177916946914	There are many things I admire and respect about Senator Isakson- among these are his leadership and his tireless work on behalf of the State of Georgia and our nation. Today, I admire his courage and strength to approach his diagnosis as he does everything else, with unwavering resolve and devotion. I look forward to continuing to work with the Senator and have no doubt that he will remain a strong leader in our state. Please join me in offering prayers and encouragement to Senator Isakson and his family.	930462453685119
131177916946914	It's Jackson and Ben's last day as interns in my Washington office- thankful for their work on behalf of the Eighth District, and I wish these two outstanding young men the best of luck!	926953180702713
131177916946914	It was great to see the 5th graders from Ben Hill Elementary School in Washington (and even exchange a few high-fives)!	926311710766860
131177916946914	Great turn-out at our Local Government Grants Fair and Workshop! Over the years, I've consistently heard from our counties and local officials that funding for things like infrastructure, sewer, roads, and emergency response equipment is a top need, but the grant application process can often be daunting, complicated, and competitive. This workshop was created to bring together key representatives and information from federal and state agencies to hopefully simplify the grant process. Did you miss our workshop or still have questions? Call my Tifton Office for assistance: (229) 396-5175	922487467815951
131177916946914	Today, the Administration launched its latest regulatory overreach by broadening the definition of "Waters of the US" to include waters in ditches, floodplains, man-made ponds, and streams. Not only does this rule deviate sharply from the Clean Water Act's original intent, but it also hurts farmers and ranchers and the jobs the agriculture industry provides. This is why I voted for the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act to stop this imprudent and over-reaching EPA regulatory onslaught and, instead, require them to return to the drawing board and work with states and local stakeholders to develop the best set of recommendations.	922022474529117
131177916946914	It's Stamp Out Hunger Day! If you have a little extra in your pantry to contribute, you can leave canned goods in your mailbox today for pick up!

131177916946914	Last night, I supported the conference agreement to the House and Senate versions of the federal government's budget. It was 2001 when the House and Senate last jointly produced a budget that balances, which is a common sense step to getting our fiscal house in order. However, the big win today was for national defense. The House and the Senate came together to ensure that our military is adequately funded, which is important for the state of Georgia as our bases and assets play a large role in our country’s defense. I remained committed to working on behalf of our nation’s warfighters to ensure they have the resources they need to be well trained, equipped, and care for. As we continue our fight against terrorism abroad, our readiness back home becomes that much more important. This legislation also cuts spending by $5.3 trillion, repeals ObamaCare while allowing for more patient-centered reforms, and improves the efficiency, oversight, and accountability of the federal government.	911386488926049
131177916946914	Was glad I could join some of my GA colleagues on the Capitol Steps to greet these Camp Sunshine attendees. I hope y'all enjoyed your time in Washington!	911385185592846
131177916946914	Always great to see the folks from Georgia Farm Bureau! Today, they were kind enough to present me with the Friend of Farm Bureau award for my support in Congress of their work on behalf of agriculture in our state. I'm proud to represent Georgia's Eighth District Farmers on the House Agriculture Committee!	910797438984954
131177916946914	Enjoyed discussing Georgia military priorities with Major General Levy with the US Air Force, Lieutenant General Faulkner with the US Marine Corps, and Brigadier General Jarrard, Adjutant General of the GA National Guard. Our state’s military bases and assets, including Robins and Moody Air Force Bases, play a significant role in our nation’s defense. #GAmil	910359172362114
505646972800006	Had a blast with Mount Vernon Elementary School in Gainesville, Georgia.  Talked #American history to the enthusiastic crowd.

131177916946914	I'd like to take the time to recognize three outstanding young men from the Eighth District who have been accepted into US Military Service Academies: Jason Hightower of Mary Persons High School and Brett Decker and Michael Taylor of Veterans High School.  Jason and Brett will be attending the Air Force Academy while Michael is headed to the Naval Academy. Their acceptance is a testament to their hard work and strength of character. It is an honor to represent these young Georgians who desire to serve in our nation's military and lead our country to a brighter future. Please join me in congratulating Jason, Brett, and Michael!	910299055701459
131177916946914	Enjoyed my visit with the AP Government students at Warner Robins High School today. I was happy to discuss my role in Congress on the House Armed Services and Agriculture Committees- hopefully, I was able to provide a little context for what they have been learning!	909778059086892
131177916946914	Congratulations to the Eighth District participants of the 2015 Congressional Art Competition! Thank you to those who were able to join me at our awards reception at Thomasville Center for the Arts to see all of the impressive entries.

131177916946914	As a former 4-H member, it was great to see so many young future leaders up here in Washington this week.

131177916946914	Today is #TaxDay. Ensuring that hard working American citizens see less money taken from their paychecks should be one of our top priorities. It is time we work towards a fairer, simpler tax code for Georgian families and for our businesses working hard to create jobs.	903058636425501

131177916946914	Always a pleasure to speak with the ABAC Collegiate Young Farmers Club!  Since Georgia is one of the top agricultural states in our country, it was great to see so many driven college students right here in the Eighth District who are interested in the agriculture industry.	895694530495245
131177916946914	One of the greatest duties we have as Members of Congress is to provide for our nation’s defense. To accomplish this, we must ensure our military is adequately funded. The primary reason I voted for the FY2016 House Republican Budget is because it will fund our defense above the President’s request and, therefore, provide our military relief from the sequester this year. While I am in favor of a long-term agreement to remove the threat of sequestration, this budget is big step towards improving the readiness of our Armed Forces and providing for our troops. The Republican budget funds national defense by $613 billion through a combination of base spending and Overseas Contingency Operation funding.  It does this while also balancing the federal deficit in 10 years without raising taxes. \n\nAs the only Georgia Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, I will fight to guarantee our nation’s warfighters have the resources they need to be well trained, equipped, and compensated. As we continue our fight against terrorism abroad, our readiness back home becomes that much more important.	891974964200535
131177916946914	On this day, we remember Selma's role in the civil rights movement and those who participated, like my respected friend and colleague from Georgia, Rep. John Lewis. #Selma50	880133492051349

131177916946914	The two pictures below show the rise in terrorist groups from 21 groups in 2004 to 41 groups in 2014. I’d like to point out that ISIL was operating back in 2004. I believe the President’s foreign policy has contributed to the instability in the region, creating an environment that terrorists have exploited. When the President referred to ISIL as the “JV” team, he downplayed the risk posed by the ISIL and other radical groups and gave our partner nations in the Middle East little reason to have confidence in our leadership.	871232189608146

505646972800006	Sheriffs Janis Mangum and Randy Shirley from Northeast Georgia joined me and Congressman Dave Reichert for a National Police Week event in Washington on Thursday. We talked about more ways Congress can support local law enforcement officers. \n\nThis week, House #Republicans passed a national Blue Alert system to quickly identify perpetrators of anti-police violence. I recently introduced legislation to allow federal officers to carry their firearms in the event of a government funding lapse, as well as to improve mental health training to protect officers from harm. \n\nMy father was a Georgia State Trooper. Police Week was another opportunity to remember the contributions he and officers around the country have made to our safety and security.	939850952712937
505646972800006	I thought the story of David and Goliath would be a good one for the National Community Pharmacists Association yesterday on Capitol Hill. I reminded members from the Georgia Pharmacy Association, who were there, that David cast multiple stones before Goliath fell. In that spirit, I introduced the MAC Transparency Act in the first days of the 114th Congress. \n\nIt would level the playing field for independent and community pharmacists, often surprised by federal drug programs' sudden price spikes. It would compel those programs to disclose unfair practices that benefit large pharmacies at the expense of smaller ones, the backbone of Northeast Georgia's health care system.	939003456131020

505646972800006	Great to be back at Patterson Pump Company in #Toccoa! \n\nPatterson Pump contacted my office a few months ago, when one of its pumps got stuck in Florida on the way to New Orleans. We were able to get it moving again. \n\nIt is an honor to be able to assist a great company like Patterson, continuing to manufacture and provide jobs in America!\n\nAlso ran into Abigail Vickery, whom I nominated to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. It was great to say hi to her, one of the next generation of America's military leaders.	894739937224039

113303673339	Proud to celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy today in Athens by speaking at the University of Georgia's Annual Freedom Breakfast.	10152131208253340
113303673339	Congressman Scott also visited Hot 107.9 , Majic 107.5 | 97.5  and Praise 102.5 today with SBA Regional Administrator Cassius Butts and Leslie Wiggins of the Atlanta VAMC. Administrator Butts described resources for small business owners that will be offered at the Jobs Fair's Small Business Forum this Friday.	10153201708953340
113303673339	I visited 11Alive's  Atlanta & Company today with VA regional directors to discuss employment and benefits resources that will be available for veterans at my Jobs Fair, one week from today on Friday, April 24, 10am to 3pm, at the GA International Convention Center.	10153193997093340
113303673339	Today I joined U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez at Gwinnett Technical College to announce the recipients of $200 million in competitive awards to 10 states to help Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP) participants find jobs and work toward self-sufficiency. Georgia's pilot project was among the 10 chosen and partners with the GA Technical College System, Department of Economic Development, Local Workforce Investment Areas, and the Department of Family and Children Services. For more information, visit: http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentid=2015/03/0071.xml&contentidonly=true.	10153126319028340
113303673339	I'm greeting the President on the Tarmac at ATL. What question would you ask him as he visits Atlanta today?	10153103067243340
113303673339	TSA, ICE, and other DHS employees at ATL - I appreciate what you do everyday. You have my support to keep you paid. Thanks for your service.	10153080217698340
113303673339	Tea Party Republicans just revolted against Speaker Boehner and voted down a three week stop-gap funding bill for homeland security. If nothing changes, there will be a shutdown. Employees deemed "essential" will have to report to work without pay this weekend. This affects border agents, immigration agents, the Coast Guard, TSA and many others.	10153078524928340
113303673339	Last year, Congress passed the annual budgets for all departments except for the Department of Homeland Security. Republicans are mad at the President over immigration. Rather than having a separate debate about immigration, they are holding up the homeland security budget. Congress should pass a homeland security budget now and move on to immigration later. There is plenty of time to vent their anger about the President once we secure America.	10153077957243340
113303673339	It was good to see many of our hard-working, local labor leaders and members this morning at the IBEW's Atlanta office.	10152891837628340
113303673339	I enjoyed meeting with members of the South Fulton Chamber of Commerce yesterday and providing a legislative update. There are so many good projects and initiatives underway in South Fulton.	10152891781898340
113303673339	Thank you veterans. Our appreciation for your service should not be just one day of the year, but every day.  You allow us to have freedom and prosperity. I will continue to fight for an improved VA system on your behalf. Please contact my office should you ever need assistance.	10152810531223340
113303673339	Yesterday I enjoyed joining Union City Mayor Vince Williams for the major announcement to transform the former Shannon Mall into a major film studio. This project will be a catalyst that will stimulate economic activity throughout the south metro part of Atlanta.	10152776488763340
113303673339	Earlier this week I visited the VA Community Clinics in Carrolton and Austell with Director Leslie Wiggins, of the Atlanta VA Medical Center, and Senator Johnny Isakson. We met with veterans and VA staff and I observed firsthand the VA's continued efforts to improve how medical appointments are scheduled for our veterans.	10152766690418340
113303673339	Several counties have now created a Sunday early voting day for the general election. A statewide Saturday early voting day is already scheduled. What do you think? Should access to the ballot be expanded for a full weekend of early voting?	10152663091533340
113303673339	Last night, the House voted along party lines to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to sue President Obama. There is Washington talk that this is the first step towards the Republicans trying to impeach the President. What do you think? Should the House try to solve some problems rather than trying to create new ones?	10152562088778340
113303673339	The VA Secretary has resigned.  This is only the first step to badly-needed reforms.  We must keep pushing for the best care possible for our veterans.	10152418261318340
113303673339	Congressman Scott must have hit a nerve yesterday since thousands of people have sent well wishes of support for reform at the VA.  This is not a partisan issue, this is an American issue.	10152400020703340
113303673339	After initiating a congressional inquiry, I had the honor yesterday of joining the U.S. Air Force in making a special presentation of 5 medals to a constituent who served  during the Korean War but never received his awards. If you are or someone you know is owed medals from service, please contact my District Office for assistance.	10152318925743340
113303673339	Republican leaders in the House will not allow for votes on popular measures such as raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance and immigration reform.  I have signed discharge petitions to force floor votes on these bills. They would pass with bipartisan support.	10152290971378340
113303673339	Mortgage assistance will be available at the jobs fair. All of the major lenders will attend as well as reps from the Home Safe Georgia program. Bring your loan docs and copies of your resumes tomorrow.	10152279136053340
113303673339	I was on Roland Martin's show this morning discussing judges.  Roland gets it and has been on the story for several months. \n\nThis clip from the Washington Post editorial linked yesterday gives a little summary of the problems concerning the nominees from Georgia:  \n\nObama made Chambliss and Isaakson an offer they couldn’t refuse: If they would stop blocking Pryor, Obama would allow them to pick three nominees to the U.S. district court — positions that come with a lifetime appointment.\n\nTheir first selection was unsurprising: They chose Michael Boggs, an anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights candidate with a spotty record on civil rights issues.\n\nAs a state legislator, Boggs sponsored a bill that created special “Choose Life” license plates, with proceeds going to “Pregnancy Resource Centers” that counsel women against abortions. He also sponsored a bill requiring a parent or guardian to accompany any minor seeking an abortion. He introduced a resolution calling for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage on the basis of “good Christian values.” He refused to support a measure that would remove the Confederate battle emblem from the Georgia state flag.	10152216998908340
113303673339	Praying for those who are still waiting word from their family members stuck on the roads.  Please be safe.  What are you hearing about the roads this morning?  Did you make it home last night?	10152155615853340
113303673339	The State of the Union is tonight.  What should the President say to America?	10152154418163340
104548906262119	Senator Johnny Isakson has served our state honorably for more than 35 years. Despite being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, I have no doubt he will continue to serve our state with the same vigor and distinction he always has. I look forward to continuing to work with Sen. Isakson for years to come.	954879484562386
104548906262119	Great discussion at the Transportation Roundtable put on by Congressman Bill Shuster this morning in Atlanta. Big thanks to Georgia Tech President Bud Peterson and his campus team for hosting us.	954098501307151

104548906262119	My office hosted our annual Senior Fair in Dalton yesterday. Here's a few pictures from the event.	946368205413514

104548906262119	It was an honor to attend the annual Law Enforcement Awards Luncheon in Rome this afternoon, which was put together by the Rome Seven Hills Rotary and the Optimist Club. I'm very grateful for the service and sacrifices our officers make to keep us safe.	937640229619645
104548906262119	Great to see State Rep. Katie Dempsey, Dr. Reverend Bob Skelton and Del Tackett, who was the keynote speaker, at the Rome Leadership Prayer Breakfast this morning.	937582739625394
104548906262119	Good discussion about Georgia military priorities today with USMC Lieutenant General William Faulkner, Adjutant General of Georgia Department of Defense Joe Jarrard, Senator David Perdue, Senator Johnny Isakson, Rep. Austin Scott and Rep. Sanford Bishop. #GAmil	934293563287645
104548906262119	As part of a Congressional delegation, I traveled this week to Tunisia and Ukraine. In Tunis, Tunisia, the delegation laid a wreath to commemorate the innocent lives taken during the recent terrorist attack at the Bardo National Museum. The United States stands with the people of Tunisia. As freedom loving people, we will work together to secure a hopeful and prosperous future, and defeat the despair and bondage that terrorism seeks to impose.\n\nThe delegation’s visit to Ukraine comes after the House passed a bipartisan resolution last week that urges the president to provide lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine. It’s important that the United States stands in solidarity with Ukraine in their quest for a free and democratic future in the face of Russian aggression. This visit was critical in getting real time information concerning the recent developments from Ukrainian leaders.	919989821384686
104548906262119	Obamacare is five years old today. So far, it's cost $42 billion in regulatory expenses, more than $1.5 billion for its failed website and cut the benefits of Medicare Advantage registrants by $1,300. And millions of people across the country have lost the health insurance plan they like and the doctor they trust. The need for real health care reform is greater than ever.	915417241841944
104548906262119	Thanks to everyone who participated in this year's Congressional Art Competition, and thanks to Rockmart Cultural Arts Center for hosting the reception last night. I'm continually impressed by the talented young people of the 14th District!	913900011993667
104548906262119	This week, I voted for the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act and the Secret Science Reform Act, legislation that would help rein in the EPA’s continual overreach. When the EPA uses secret science and one-sided debate to justify unnecessary regulations, it has real life consequences for hard-working Americans across the country. Jobs are lost, utility bills skyrocket and it costs more to feed the family. These common sense reforms will help protect the American people from the consequences of EPA overreach.	913060842077584
104548906262119	Hosted my annual Veterans Benefits Fair today, which helps veterans and their families learn about the benefits they have earned in the service of our country. Glad we could help so many who stopped by!	909918519058483

104548906262119	Enjoyed visiting with members of the Polk Rotary today, and updating them on my work in Congress.	908748642508804
104548906262119	ATF is taking public comments on the Obama administration's proposed ammo-ban plan until March 16. Please speak out against this egregious violation of our Second Amendment rights by sending your comments to APAComments@atf.gov.	902950956421906
104548906262119	I joined my fellow GA House Republicans in opposition to the Obama administration’s new effort to effectively ban common ammunition for America’s most popular rifle, the AR-15. To accomplish this ban, the Obama administration’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives proposed a new “framework” that expands the “armor-piercing” ammunition ban to include ammunition commonly used by sportsmen. \n\nWe sent a letter to Todd Jones, the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, demanding answers for this political and arbitrary proposal. We told him that “the framework appears to be nothing but a brazen attempt to bypass Congress and the American people to enact President Obama’s gun control agenda.” You can read the full letter here: http://dougcollins.house.gov/uploads/GA%20HOUSE%20AMMO%20LETTER2.pdf	902187536498248
104548906262119	I was honored to present medals to World War II Veteran Richard Carbaugh (who just celebrated his 90th birthday) and to Steve Crump on behalf of his father, World War II Veteran Lester Nolan. I'm so thankful for their service and the many sacrifices they made to protect our freedom.	900458700004465
104548906262119	Great conversation at our "Coffee with the Congressman" event in Whitfield County this morning.	900349370015398
104548906262119	As chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee on Appropriations, I had the opportunity to tour the Architect of the Capitol's Cannon House Office Building Renewal Project as well as the Capitol Dome Restoration Project along with Representative Scott Rigell, Congressman Mark Amodei, Rep. Evan Jenkins and Rep. David Young.	895555913828077
104548906262119	Do you support the Keystone pipeline? \n\nTomorrow the House will vote on the Senate's bill approving the Keystone XL pipeline, meaning a Keystone approval bill will finally – for the first time - go to the president. Even though the president threatened to veto this legislation, I truly hope that, once this bill is sitting on his desk, he will not turn his back on all of the Americans who would have the opportunity to work as a result of this pipeline. #TimeToBuild	894070577309944
104548906262119	Enjoyed speaking to the Kiwanis Club of Rome this afternoon at Bella Roma Grill.	893614354022233
392284484191405	Congratulations to this weekend's honorees who earned recognition at the Hawaii Food Manufacturers Association’s 2015 Taste Awards!\n\nRoselani Ice Cream – Governor’s Lifetime Achievement Award\n\nHonolulu Cookie Company – Innovate Hawaii Manufacturer of the Year (large company), Innovative Marketing Award\n\nAloha Tofu Factory – Innovate Hawaii Manufacturer of the Year (small company)\n\nMaui Gold Pineapple Company – Startup Manfacturer of the Year\n\nHawaiian Chip Company's Kilauea Fire Hot Sauce – Produce of the Year\n\nByron Goo, The Tea Chest – Advocate of the Year\n\nHFM Foodservice – Supplier of the Year\n\nMeadow Gold – Community Service Award	857069307712918
392284484191405	In her role as a co-chair of the Congressional Post-9/11 Veterans Caucus, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and fellow cochair and Congressman Scott Perry (R-PA), hosted a special event and screening of the Oscar Award-winning documentary "Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1”.\n\n“The tragically high rate of veterans who are taking their own lives requires our nation's immediate attention and action. Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1, is a moving and compelling film that draws much-needed attention to the difficulties that our veterans continue to face. The film also highlights how critical it is that we have a system of support that will help and assist our veterans who are suffering from mental illness. One of the reasons Rep. Scott Perry and I founded the Congressional Post-9/11 Veterans Caucus was to call attention to these very issues and to work with our partners to bring about solutions.” - TG\n\nThe documentary is about the Veterans Crisis Line in upstate New York and earned an Oscar for Best Documentary Short Subject during the 87th Academy Awards in 2015. The film examines the suicide epidemic among veterans who have served since 2001 and highlights the complex support networks that exist for veterans suffering from a mental illness. The screening is in conjunction with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Awareness Month.	854170054669510
392284484191405	Aloha Oahu and Moloka'i veterans and ohana.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs will have a VA Benefits Counselor on Oahu on June 6 from 9am-12pm at the Oahu Veterans Center, and on Moloka'i on June 20 from 9am-12pm at the Moloka'i Veterans Caring for Veterans Center.

392284484191405	In her Hawaiʻi meetings and visits this week, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard continued to celebrate servicemembers, veterans, and Military Academy students in honor of Memorial Day. This morning at Pearl Harbor, Rep. Gabbard met with team members from Pono Pacific, a Hawaiʻi-based and locally owned SBA company, at the site where they are actively clearing 25 acres of invasive mangrove.  Once the job is complete, the Navy intends to work with cultural groups to restore the Hawaiian Fish Pond, making it the only one of its kind on Oʻahu’s south shore. The congresswoman then attended the Navy’s Change of Command Ceremony at which Admiral Scott H. Swift assumed command of the U.S. Pacific Fleet from Admiral Harry B. Harris, Jr., who then assumed command of the U.S. Pacific Command from Admiral Samuel J. Locklear III.  This evening, Rep. Gabbard congratulated Hawaiʻi students who will be entering the Military Academies this summer and fall at a reception hosted by the Hawaiʻi Military Affairs Council.	850698515016664
392284484191405	On Monday, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard delivered the keynote address at the Lanaʻi Memorial Day Service at Dole Park, honoring fallen servicemembers and all veterans. While on the Private Isle, the congresswoman hosted a townhall meeting and visited the Health Center, Culture and Heritage Center, and Community Hospital.  She enjoyed working with residents on issues relating to economic growth, job opportunities, healthcare, sustainable agriculture, and veterans services.	850696628350186
392284484191405	This week is Hurricane Preparedness Week. The safety of Hawai‘i families is always a top priority – we need to ensure people are prepared and have a plan for hurricane season. \n\nEveryone should create an emergency kit that includes food and supplies, know your evacuation routes, and make a family communications plan. \n\nFor tips and information about hurricanes visit: www.ready.gov/hurricanes or http://www.scd.hawaii.gov/dp_kit.html #HurricanePrep	849946618425187
392284484191405	This morning, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard honored fallen servicemembers and all veterans in a moving Memorial Day speech at a ceremony held at the Waikiki Natatorium War Memorial. She shared personal stories of fellow soldiers who gave their lives in service to their country and recognized local heroes who have passed—either on duty or after laying down the uniform.  The congresswoman also spoke about the great value in paying homage at national treasures such as the Natatorium in Waikiki and other memorials built in tribute to those who have served. In her closing remarks, Rep. Gabbard spoke about honoring service members who have passed, as well as those still living, by fighting to ensure they and their families receive the well-earned benefits and services they were promised.	849242851828897
392284484191405	This evening, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard delivered the keynote address at Island Pacific Academy’s 2015 Commencement Exercise at Lanikuhonua, Ko ʻOlina.  She honored the graduates for their accomplishments, recognized the parents and educators who supported them, spoke about the satisfaction of living a life of serving others before self, and gifted each graduate with a congressional certificate of honor.	848857695200746
392284484191405	"I was honored to speak yesterday at the U.S. Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, D.C. to commemorate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. It is good to reflect on the trailblazers that came before us, and those who made it easier for people from all types of backgrounds to serve. And additionally, how we can do better to be more inclusive in our military, in our government, and across our entire economy. \n \nI would like to thank the Coast Guard for inviting me to speak, as well as the Aloha Boys, and the Black Belt Academy for their contribution to the program yesterday.

230753786936538	Memorial Day is a reminder to the families and friends of those who died in service to our country. On this day, I extend my heartfelt compassion the families and the men and women who continue to serve our nation.	1037098646302044
392284484191405	Yesterday, the City of New York dedicated part of 33rd Street to our beloved Father Damien today. The street, titled Father Damien Way, will commemorate a priest, community leader, and human rights activist.\n\nWhile I was unable to be there in person, Emily Latimer, from my staff, attended the event and presented a commemoration message on my behalf.\n\nFather Damien demonstrated the aloha spirit through his unconditional love and compassion towards Hansens Disease patients on Moloka`i. He selflessly tended tirelessly to their physical ailments, emotional struggles, and spiritual needs with only their future and well-being in mind. His example of servant-leadership serves as a model and inspiration for people everywhere to follow.\n\nThank you to Minister-President Geert Bourgeois, Archbishop Timothy Dolan, and the City of New York for dedicating part of 33rd Street to our beloved Pāpā Kamiano o Molokaʻi. Best wishes for a truly historical and memorable celebration.	844432918976557
392284484191405	Today is the first day of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, when we celebrate all the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders that have enriched America’s history.\n\nThe members of this community have left their mark on politics, the military, science, business, arts, sports, and every other aspect of our nation’s culture. Hawai‘i, a state where the majority of residents are Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders, has produced numerous leaders including U.S. Senators Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka, and Congresswoman Patsy Mink, all of whom worked tirelessly to better the lives of all Americans.	839668899452959

The girls had such excellent questions for me and are surely the next servant-leaders of our community. As I shared with them, sometimes it starts with sending a tweet. Or it might be calling your Member of Congress.

392284484191405	I send my deepest condolences to the family and friends of those service members whose lives were lost last night in this terrible accident.  The Louisiana Army National Guard Soldiers and Marines aboard this helicopter served their country selflessly and with courage: from serving in combat overseas, to participating in humanitarian missions after Hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill, these selfless souls embodied what it means to lead by putting others first. They risked their lives in training and in combat in the service of our country.\n\nCrews are continuing their search of a six-mile area near the crash and I am thankful for all their efforts. This accident is heartbreaking to all of us. To the friends and families of these brave service members, your nation is grateful.	809863305766852

392284484191405	On this historic day, we remember those who marched across Edmund Pettus 50 years ago, to draw the nation's attention to the immoral treatment of African Americans in our own country.  Those brave souls sacrificed their bodies and seared images into the country's conscience that fueled the civil rights movement. \n \nWe remember that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice, but only when we all stand up and speak out against bigotry and discrimination. As a nation, we must honor the memory of those courageous souls who marched on Selma, by continuing their work, and living aloha - treating all people with respect, compassion, and love.  While times have changed, unfortunately we still see examples of bigotry, harassment, and discrimination in our country. Let this important day be a reminder that it is imperative that we understand and uphold the importance of protecting these sacred civil rights and equal treatment for all.	807429942676855

180970951936493	I welcome President Obama to our great state today. I wish him well as he speaks this afternoon at Boise State University, where his 2008 campaign rally was a memorable event for Idaho Democrats.\n \nAfter last night’s State of the Union, I think the president could benefit from listening to Idahoans. He would do well to reflect on how the venue where he speaks today, the Caven-Williams Sports Complex, was built.  He could reflect on the journey of two Idaho families, and many others, who worked hard, played by the rules, became successful and generously shared their success with our community.    \n \nIdaho families work hard and value individual responsibility. Idaho businesses are built on innovation and self-reliance. Idaho governments balance their budgets. During his short visit, I hope the president absorbs some Idaho common sense.	916111321755782
180970951936493	My reaction to President Obama's State of the Union address:\n\nPresident Obama’s speechmaking skills are legendary. But once again, the president seems unfazed by last November's election results that were a complete repudiation of his presidency and his liberal agenda. \n\nHe correctly states that the American economy has turned the page. But the turnaround started when Republicans took over the House four years ago and stopped his agenda.  It happened in spite of him, not because of him. \n\nHe glosses over the fact that the middle class has suffered greatly during his six years in office. The president now proposes tax-and-spend policies he couldn’t get passed in his first two years in office when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. For all his eloquence, he can’t sell his failed left-wing policies to the American people.  \n \nDuring the next two years, President Obama has an opportunity to heed the model of presidents who learned from mid-term defeats and reached across the aisle. Republicans support real tax and regulatory reform, a lasting fix for our broken immigration system and tackling an $18 billion deficit that restrains long-term growth. After the showmanship and pageantry of his speech, I hope the president gets serious about solving America’s problems. We’re ready to work with him.	916002851766629
180970951936493	I can't blame many of my supporters for being upset with my vote for Speaker Boehner. I ask, however, that they consider not just a single vote but my long record as a champion of conservative values who stands up to the establishment. \n\nMr. Boehner, who was assured re-election, sought my help in moving the House in a more conservative direction. I will hold him accountable to that commitment. \n\nFor more, listen to my interview with KBOI 670's Nate Shelman on Tuesday. The interview begins at 35:45 and concludes at 47:05. Here's the link:\n\nhttp://stationcaster.com/player_skinned.php?s=2201&c=10121&f=3819433	906979152668999
180970951936493	Read my full statement on why I voted for Speaker Boehner today: \n\nToday, I made a difficult decision in voting for John Boehner for Speaker of the House.  Many constituents from Idaho contacted me to let me know that I should not support him.  I want them to know that I did not make this decision lightly. I share the view of the majority of my constituents who are deeply frustrated by the way the House has run the last four years.\n  \nI understand that many of my most loyal supporters are angry with my vote.  I ask them to remember that for the last four years I have stood tall for the conservative cause. In December, I opposed the end of year spending bill by opposing both the rule and final passage.  Last year I ran for Majority Leader of the House when no one else was willing to stand up against the establishment in Washington.  And every time over the past four years that the Speaker ignored the views of the Republican majority and the voice of the American people, I opposed him.\n\nIn 2013, I led the effort to oust Speaker Boehner from his leadership post.  At that time, we had sufficient votes to be successful, but at the last minute several members changed their votes to support Boehner.  \n\nThis year was different – even after 25 Republicans opposed the Speaker, we still needed 12 more votes.  The votes were simply not there to defeat the Speaker.  I think it is unwise to marginalize yourself when there is no chance of victory, which was the case today.\n\nBefore I cast my vote for Mr. Boehner, I spoke with him multiple times.  He assured me that he wants to change the way the House is run.  He cited my successful efforts last August in bringing conservatives together to pass two bills that would have secured the border and prevented Obama’s illegal executive actions.  He asked for my help moving the House in a more conservative direction and promised that this would be a model for how he’ll conduct himself as Speaker in the 114th Congress.  \n\nMy vote for Mr. Boehner is not an endorsement of his past leadership.  Just as I have done during my first two terms in office, I will continue to fight for the American people and hold our leadership accountable.	906363749397206
180970951936493	This Christmas I want to thank you all for reading my newsletters throughout the year and for your words of encouragement and support.  I was reading some of my past newsletters and found that I could not really express myself much better about this Christmas season than the words I wrote last Christmas.  So I am sharing those words again with a few updates; I hope you don't mind.\n\nEvery year, on Christmas, we gather with friends and family to celebrate a tradition that spans 2,000 years; inspires millions of Americans and billions of people around the world; and brings out the greatest joys of life – a sense of meaning, a spirit of generosity and kindness, and a conviction we are all connected in ways that we can hardly imagine.\n\nThis week, I will be celebrating Christmas with my wife, Becca, our five children, and our new daughter in law.  Like so many other families across Idaho, my family will gather around the Christmas tree, exchange gifts, reflect on the significance on this amazing day, and reflect on the many blessings we have enjoyed over the past year.  As we get closer to New Year’s Day, we will also set goals for the year ahead and look ahead to the future with a sense of optimism and purpose. \n\nAs Americans, we are blessed to live in a country that honors freedom of religion, so that every American is able to celebrate Christmas or whichever holiday undergirds their faith.  In fact, freedom of religion is one of the founding principles of our country – the very first amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Every person – in America and throughout the world – has a basic human right to practice their faith without fear of government interference.  That right has been cherished throughout American history, and we must never take it for granted. \n\nAs your Representative, I also want to say that I am blessed to have the opportunity to serve you in Congress.  I am humbled by the responsibilities you have given me, and I want you to know that I work every day to be worthy of your trust.  I look forward to representing you in 2015, working with you to defend our Constitution and honor our spiritual heritage. \n\nI wish you and your family a wonderful Christmas and a wondrous holiday season.  This is truly the time of year in which families become closer together and memories are formed that last a lifetime.  It is my hope that you are able to enjoy the gifts of faith, hope, and love that define this time of year.  And it is my prayer that the spirit of goodwill that we experience during this joyous season will continue with us through the coming year.\n\nMay you and your family have a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!	896812090352372
180970951936493	Good news today on my two bills likely to become law. Here's the press release: \n\nLABRADOR GRAZING, GUN RANGE BILLS HEAD TO PRESIDENT\n \nThe two measures – one local, one national – clear the Senate\n \nWASHINGTON, D.C. – Two bills introduced by Rep. Raúl Labrador, R-Idaho, offering regulatory relief in federal land management are expected to become law after final passage in the Senate Friday. \n \nThe Grazing Improvement Act, which Labrador has been working on since he came to Congress in 2011, will provide stability for about 20,000 ranchers who lease grazing rights on more than 250 million acres of federal land.  \n \nIntroduced as H.R. 657, the grazing reform bill would temporarily extend permits while the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service process a backlog of environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act. It also allows the agencies to issue permits and leases under categorical exclusions from NEPA if they continue current management and grazing is not adversely affecting land health. Finally, the bill permanently exempts livestock trailing from full NEPA review.  \n \nRanchers with grazing permits own nearly 120 million acres of nearby lands, making the collaborative management critical to rural economies. More stable business conditions will prompt investment in improvements such as stock ponds that benefit livestock and wildlife. \n \nThe Idaho County Shooting Range Land Conveyance Act would establish the first public shooting range in the state’s largest county by conveying 31 acres of BLM land to Idaho County. Introduced as H.R. 5040, Labrador’s bill was necessary because federal regulations blocked the transfer of the parcel used informally as a gun range by sportsmen and women. The bill has the BLM’s support and the County Commission has agreed to manage the site as a shooting range and work closely with law enforcement on maintenance.\n  \n“The Idaho County gun range bill resolves a local issue that has been pending for close to six years,” Labrador said. “I am just as gratified to see it pass as I am the grazing reform that will boost economic certainty for ranchers across the West. Both measures are examples of how Congress can act to better manage public resources.”\n \nUnfortunately, the measures were attached in the House to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, in the closing days of the 113th Congress.  The NDAA was totally unrelated to the substance of Labrador’s bills, which had previously passed with bipartisan support. Labrador voted against the defense bill because he continues to object to the NDAA on both foreign policy and civil liberties grounds. He opposes the NDAA's authorization of $1.6 billion to arm and train Syrian rebels and continues to have concerns about the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism.	888987011134880
180970951936493	Here's my statement after voting against the fiscal year 2015 catch-all appropriations bill that raises spending to $1.1 trillion, up $88 billion from fiscal year 2014 levels:\n \n“Once again, Congress has failed to take seriously its responsibility to squarely address the federal spending crisis. The last two days have been particularly outrageous with the process driven by a handful of people behind closed doors. The result is a 1,603-page bill larded with pork and favors for special interests. The funding bill also fails to address the president’s unconstitutional immigration order.\n\n“I promised Idahoans I would do everything in my power to stem the growth of our now-$18 trillion debt, which Congress refuses to do.  Next year, with both the House and Senate in Republican hands, my sincere hope is we quit stalling and enact meaningful spending reforms.”	888584084508506
180970951936493	Read my statement issued following President Obama’s announcement Thursday evening of a new executive order regarding U.S. immigration law:  \n \n“Today President Obama conceded his failure as a leader on immigration. Instead of finding common ground with Congress, he chose to bail out his bankrupt presidency through an order he has already admitted he cannot legally take. He violated his promise to champion reform in his first term, sabotaged bipartisan House negotiations in his second and bred distrust by failing to faithfully enforce the law throughout. \n \n“Now he wants to save face by imposing unilaterally what he could not achieve democratically. Congress must defend its constitutional role to make laws and immediately block his illegal action through all available avenues.\n \n“The president’s action not only undermines efforts to achieve real reform – it is directly opposed to it. Real reform starts with enforcing current laws, securing the border and modernizing the visa system. Only a system that works – that drives immigrants into viable avenues for legal entry – will end illegal immigration and protect the rule of law. That is what I will continue to fight for – no matter who occupies the White House.”	877132765653638

230753786936538	During this year’s Domestic Violence Awareness Month, Americans should join together in rededicating ourselves to eradicating from our society the scourge of domestic violence.

230753786936538	I would like to congratulate Jackie Robinson West for earning a spot in the Little League World Series championship game. These 13 young men from the South Side of Chicago took home the championship out of a 7-5 victory in the United States final against Nevada. You young men have beaten the odds and you tell the story of what true community investment means. I am sure this will not be the last we hear of your accomplishments as this victory will carry you throughout life. The character that your coaches and parents have instilled will build you into strong men. Although, you have a long road ahead, I pray that you continue to pursue your passions and remain active in your communities. Thank you for representing our city and our nation with poise and maturity. You have made us all proud.	871051006240143
230753786936538	The American system of oppressive conditioning still persist and will continue if we allow it. Although, physical chains no longer exist the police activity across this country is reminiscent of a southern plantation. Young black people are not prey for police departments and their rights must be upheld because they too are deserving of the sworn office duty to serve and protect.	864124220266155

150380975141321	I am happy to announce that the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has awarded grants to the South Holland Public Library and the Steger-South Chicago Heights Public Library to host public programs that highlight the rich history of Latino Americans. The grants are part of the Latino Americans: 500 Years of History learning project. Each library will receive $3,000 to present the programs.\n\nThe South Holland Public Library will use the grant to fund a variety of cultural arts activities, including group lessons in Mexican folklore dancing and a program on the ancient Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) holiday.\n\nSteger-South Chicago Heights Library will partner with Governors State University and Prairie State College to record the stories of American Latinos in the area and later upload them onto the library and university websites.	436382529874496

150380975141321	Prior to today’s trade vote, in an effort to protect American jobs and boost American exports, I co-sponsored an amendment that proposed holding countries seeking to enter new trade agreements with the U.S. accountable for unjust currency manipulation practices. However, the bipartisan amendment was voted down by the House Rules Committee. \n\nThe amendment by Congressman Dan Kildee (D-MI) and Congressman Curt Clawson (R-FL) would have ensured that the U.S. has the tools to address and end currency manipulation by other countries in any new trade deal, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The Clawson-Kildee amendment would have directed U.S. trade negotiators to include strong and enforceable rules to prohibit currency manipulation and to hold participating countries accountable to International Monetary Fund standards. \n\nCountries such as Japan, which are currently negotiating new trade deals in secret with the U.S., continue to manipulate the value of their currency in order to decrease the cost of their own exports around the globe. Unfortunately, the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) that is being considered in Congress fails to crack down on countries that are deliberately manipulating the value of their currency, which in turn places an unfair competitive advantage against American workers and costs American jobs.By not including strong currency manipulation provisions, we’re failing to level the playing field for American workers. \n\nI’m fighting for Illinois workers who depend on policies that give them a fair shot at competing for their jobs so they can take care of their families. Our state and manufacturing economy know all too well the devastating effect of unbalanced trade deals.  Illinois workers have a lot to offer, but we’ve also lost a lot because of bad trade proposals.  It’s not responsible to expect American workers to compete on an unfair playing field against countries like Japan that continually and intentionally manipulate the value of their currency.	435454523300630

150380975141321	I'm pleased to announce that the Richton Park and Riverdale fire departments were each awarded federal grants from the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program. \n\nProviding our firefighters with the best equipment and protective gear helps keep them safe as they risk their lives to save others. I’m happy to have helped secure this critical funding because it is our firefighters who are on the front lines of protecting our communities.\n\nRichton Park will use its $135,620 grant to purchase emergency breathing equipment for firefighters. The Riverdale Fire-Rescue Department will purchase firefighting helmets with the $4,286 grant it received.	431637560348993

150380975141321	This week, another innocent life was taken in my district when 21-year old Demetrius Southland of Dolton, Illinois went out to walk his dog and became a victim of senseless gun violence. And yet the unrelenting call for an end to the violence seems to be falling on deaf ears in Congress.  \n\nI’m appalled that House Republicans included in the National Defense Authorization Act an irresponsible provision that would expand the definition of ‘firearm’ under the Civilian Marksmanship Program to include handguns. The Civilian Marksmanship Program was meant to promote rifle skills and safety. By broadening the scope of the CMP, Congress stands to allow for the transfer of over 10,000 additional handguns onto our streets without the purchasers having to undergo background checks.  \n\nI joined four of my Congressional colleagues to offer an Amendment to the NDAA to strike the provision that includes handguns in the Civilian Marksmanship Program.  The NDAA is intended to support our national defense and should not be used to manipulate domestic gun policy. \n\nSadly, House Republicans chose to ignore these reasonable concerns and refused to allow a vote on my amendment on the House floor.\n\nWith gun killings on pace to be the primary cause of death for young people 25 and under, the very future of our nation is at stake. I refuse to sit by and watch gun violence rob us of a generation. It’s time for our country to stop pursuing bad gun policies and start instituting common sense gun reforms to save lives.	424871944358888
150380975141321	I’m thrilled that President Obama has chosen Chicago’s South Side as the site for his presidential library and museum. In addition to being a premiere attraction of the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois, the library will anchor an economic development boon on the South Side that will create jobs and enrich the quality of life in the area. \n\nPerhaps most importantly, the building of a monument in honor of our country’s first African-American president will have an indelible impact for generations, as a testament to both the progress and promise of our nation.	424004564445626
150380975141321	I am proud to announce that Bloom Township High School District 206 received a $360,000 federal grant to reduce violence through school and mental health counseling programs.\n\nThe public does not realize how many of our youth suffer from post-traumatic disorders from continual exposure to violence in the home or within their communities. The soul-numbing effect too often results in mental disorders or turns youth to violence. By providing our young people with professional and supportive counseling, we can stop the cycle of violence and criminal behavior.\n\nThe purpose of the Department of Education Grant is to prevent delinquency and criminal behavior by expanding school counseling programs and increasing access to mental health services for youth exposed to or traumatized by violence, who are suffering from depression or anxiety, or who are failing or having difficulty in school.	419725254873557
150380975141321	Today I held the awards ceremony for the 2015 Congressional Art Competition at Prairie State College.

Jordyn's piece, "Jordyn Alexis" will be displayed at the U.S. Capitol for one year.  She will also receive round trip airfare to Washington to attend a reception honoring the winning artists from all 50 states.	413937355452347

150380975141321	A year ago today, 276 girls were abducted from Chibok secondary school in northern Nigeria by Nigerian militant Islamist group Boko Haram. I introduced a resolution condemning the cowardly attacks of Boko Haram, and the House unanimously passed this resolution. I will continue to support men, women, and children in the northeastern Nigerian town of Baga who were victimized, trafficked, and murdered by the terrorist group Boko Haram.

150380975141321	As we mark Equal Pay Day today, more needs to be done to close the wage gap that still exists between women and men – including passage of the critical Paycheck Fairness Act.  Equal Pay Day symbolizes when, more than three months into the year, women’s wages finally catch up to what men were paid in the previous year. Today, women make up about half of the workforce and it’s wrong that on average they are still being paid less than men. According to the National Women’s Law Center, the women in our state of Illinois still earn only 79 cents for every dollar earned by men. Congress needs to work across partisan lines to give women the pay they deserve. #EqualPayNow	412019615644121

150380975141321	The two Ferguson police officers senselessly shot earlier today are in my thoughts and prayers. Violence is never the answer. The reform that the citizens of Ferguson and the nation seek can only be achieved through mutual understanding, cooperation and respect between law enforcement and the community. \n\nIncidents of violence against police are as damaging to the pursuit of justice as incidents of police misconduct and brutality. The path to progress runs through common ground. We must come together on these grounds and work together to create a fairer and more equitable system of justice for us all. #Ferguson	397891777056905
150380975141321	America’s national security is an issue that those of us trusted by the public to serve in Congress must take seriously. In the midst of critical negotiations with Iran, Americans cannot afford to have leaders who seek to obstruct and undermine legitimate diplomatic efforts in order to score political points.\n \nIt’s disappointing that 47 U.S. Senators took the irresponsible step of sending a misguided letter to Iran in an attempt to scuttle negotiations rather than work with the White House.  It is particularly disappointing that my Senator Mark Kirk signed on to this letter. This Administration and this Congress must be united in our commitment to ensuring that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon, and it takes Democrats and Republicans working together to make that happen. #IranLetter	397066770472739
150380975141321	Today I have decided not to attend Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech because I am disappointed that support for Israel has become intertwined with divisive domestic politics. While I remain a strong supporter of Israel, I believe that circumventing protocol in extending an invitation to the Prime Minister without including the White House is disrespectful to the President and is unnecessarily divisive. I will not engage in the politics that divide us. The conversation about the U.S.-Israel relationship should never be about strengthening or diminishing the President or Prime Minister. It should be about securing a better future for our people.	394170167429066
150380975141321	Today’s Black History Month spotlight, Chancelor Bennett—who goes by the stage name Chance the Rapper—is an American hip hop recording artist from the Chatham neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. He is an alum of Jones College Prep High School. Since breaking out on the music scene in 2012, Chance has been a favorite of fans and critics alike, and was listed on a number of 50 best albums of 2013 lists, including Rolling Stones’ and NPR’s. Chance has also spoken out on many of the issues he sees people facing in his hometown. Coming from a politically active family, he infuses his music with messages about gang violence he sees holding his city hostage. He has also taken a stand against gun violence, launching a social media campaign to #SaveChicago over last Memorial Day Weekend calling on people across the city to put down their guns.	388966747949408
150380975141321	Today I voted against legislation sponsored by House Republicans that intrudes on women’s reproductive freedom and access to healthcare.  H.R. 7 would result in millions of women who work for small businesses losing access to comprehensive health coverage, and would leave millions of families who buy insurance in the Marketplaces unable to receive a premium tax credit if they have enrolled in a health plan that covers abortion.  I’m disappointed that in this new Congress, House Republicans have chosen to look backwards and re-litigate a divisive issue, instead of doing what this country needs most – move forward.  I want to bring Congress together to create jobs and put more Americans on the path to prosperity.	379584258887657
150380975141321	I look forward to serving as a vice-chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force in the 114th Congress. Last year, I released the 2014 Kelly Report on Gun Violence, the first ever Congressional analysis of the nation’s gun violence epidemic. \n\nI’m excited to work with the task force to strengthen the coalition against gun violence and pursue the Kelly Report’s common sense recommendations for stopping the epidemic. We can strike the right balance in protecting our Second Amendment rights while also protecting the right of all Americans to live free from the threat of gun violence.	375028986009851

103286879730089	Rep. Lipinski Announces 2015 Congressional Art Competition Winners\n\nCongressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) has announced that Brook Finger from Lemont High School is the Third Congressional District’s winner of this year’s Congressional Art Competition.  Finger’s painting honoring the sacrifices of area firefighters will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol for the next year alongside the winning pieces from congressional districts from across the country.  She will also receive two roundtrip tickets for the exhibition opening this summer in Washington, D.C.\n\nRep. Lipinski presented Finger with a certificate at a ceremony attended by her family and teachers at Lemont High School today.  Lipinski also gave school administrators an American flag that had been flown over the capitol building. \n\n“I congratulate Ms. Finger for submitting a powerful piece that honors our heroic first responders who bravely put their lives on the line every day, often for people they don’t even know,” Rep. Lipinski said. “Our local firefighters play a critical role in keeping our communities safe, and it is an honor to have them represented in Washington through Brook’s hard work.  I would like to thank all the young men and women throughout the district that participated in this year’s competition.  The artwork displays a great amount of talent in different media.  With so many great, diverse pieces to choose from, it was difficult to pick a winner.”  \n\nIn addition to Finger’s winning piece, the five runners-up are:  Laura Monsreal, of Reavis High School, who will have her artwork displayed in the Congressman’s D.C. office; Emma Hirt, of Lyons Township High School, who will have her piece displayed in the Congressman’s district office in Chicago; Victoria Rose Annarino, of Lemont High School, who will have her picture displayed in the Lockport district office; Tess Bowens, of Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School, who will have her artwork displayed in the Orland Park district office; and Kelly Bast, of Brookfield, who will have her piece displayed in the Oak Lawn district office.  \n\nThe Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide an opportunity for members of Congress to encourage and recognize the artistic talents of their young constituents.	905772886148147

103286879730089	This past Sunday I spoke during a special flag raising and dedication ceremony in Oak Lawn for the Eagle Scout project of Justin Aubin.  Honoring our veterans, Justin oversaw the installation of a new flagpole at the southwest corner of 52nd and Yourell, across the street from Johnson-Phelps VFW Post #5220.  The backdrop of the pole features an elegant retaining wall and paver stones are at the base in a half circle pattern.  Thanks to Justin, the community now has a beautiful new place – funded entirely by donations – to honor our veterans.	806505649408205

Small businesses create nearly two-thirds of new jobs nationally. \n\nTo help small businesses grow, expand, and create jobs, I cosponsored and helped pass the Small Business Jobs Act, which provides $12 billion in tax relief and increased access to credit for small businesses.  I also helped reauthorize the Small Business Innovation Research program, which requires agencies to partner with and support research and development done by small businesses. \n\nI will continue to support policies that give our small businesses every chance to succeed and I encourage all district residents to support this vital part of our economic engine.	712433692148735

103286879730089	Rep. Lipinski Says Congress Should Reconvene To Address ISIL Conflict\n\nStatement from Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3):\n\n“The United States has been engaging ISIL in Iraq for nearly nine weeks and has been conducting airstrikes against the terror group in Syria and Iraq for two weeks.  I agree that ISIL presents a serious threat to the U.S. and its allies in the region, and that we must continue to confront them and work to end their inhuman conduct.  \n\n“I voted to authorize the Administration to start training and equipping Syrians to fight ISIL once they have been vetted and cleared of terror connections; this initial authorization expires December 11th.  However, Congress has not voted on a measure to authorize the ongoing airstrikes or other U.S. military involvement in Syria or Iraq.  Rather, the President is relying on two congressional resolutions, one passed in 2001 in response to the attacks of 9-11 and the other passed in 2002 authoring the Iraq War.  Since it is debatable whether these two resolutions are applicable to the current situation, it would be best for Congress to reconvene as soon as possible to consider a use of force resolution specific to this conflict.  This would give Congress more time to seek answers concerning the Administration’s strategy in this conflict and how much progress – if any – has been made so far, and to have a full debate about what our nation's role should be not just in the short term but in the longer term in the region.  \n\n“Right now, Congress appears to be more concerned about being home to campaign than looking after the security of the American people.  We should not duck our responsibility in dealing with this situation as well as other ongoing threats.”	788078281250942
103286879730089	In the last day I have attended three ceremonies having to do with economic development in the area.  Yesterday, I helped break ground on a new 39 million dollar development, called Pulaski Promenade.  It will be located at 42nd and Pulaski in Archer Heights, which is currently a vacant industrial site.  Later in the day I got to tour the new Perform Physical Therapy facility in Countryside during their grand opening celebration.  It’s a new company with a bright future.  Today, I was at a ribbon cutting ceremony for Richards Building Supply in Homer Glen.  This 37 year old, highly successful local business is moving its headquarters to Homer Glen as it continues to expand operations.  It is good to see business growing here in the Third District and it would be great to see more.	785292904862813
103286879730089	Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) joined a bipartisan group of members today in helping pass an amendment to give the Defense Department authority to train and equip Syrians fighting the terrorist group ISIL.  The amendment was added to a bill that will fund operations of the government until December 11th. That legislation was passed by the House and final approval is expected in the Senate as early as tomorrow.\n\nStatement from Rep. Lipinski: \n\n“The terrorist group ISIL is a threat, not only to people in Iraq, Syria, and the rest of the Middle East, but to the rest of the world, including all of us here at home.  We have seen their inhuman brutality not just in the beheadings of two Americans, but in the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent people.  Women are especially subject to horrible acts by ISIL.  \n\n“Unfortunately, the Administration failed miserably in leadership when it came to addressing this threat over the past couple of years.  Without leadership from the U.S., no one else has and no one else will step forward, and ISIL will continue to grow.  We should not allow this threat to our security to continue to grow.  \n\n“I share the concerns that many Americans have after the debacle following the Iraq invasion.  The lost lives and wasted resources are heartbreaking.  We cannot repeat those mistakes.  But that is not a reason to do nothing.  \n\n“I support the Administration’s decision to begin air strikes against ISIL, although I believe that congressional approval should be sought if this campaign is to continue.  We have seen these air strikes save many people from a humanitarian crisis and we have seen ISIL’s advance thwarted.  \n\n“But in addition to air strikes, in order to push ISIL back, there is a need for troops on the ground.  It makes sense that these troops are the people from the region who have the most on the line right now.  In Iraq, the Peshmerga and Iraqi security forces are on the ground.  In Syria, the plan is to train and equip appropriately vetted Syrians to do the fighting on the ground. \n\n“While I have some concerns about this plan, the amendment we voted on today makes sure that Congress receives details about how the Defense Department will screen, train, and equip the Free Syrian Army and/or other non-terror aligned groups prior to that taking place, and about the mission’s strategy, timeline, and level of involvement of U.S. forces, and following that, progress reports every 90 days about changes or updates to the plan, statistics on attacks and American assistance, and the effects of our assistance.  The Administration must follow through on these requirements and Congress must seriously conduct oversight and decide whether to continue or to cut off the authorization and funding.  \n\n“American forces should not be the frontline of this fight.  The Administration must use the means of persuasion at its disposal to build a broad regional and international coalition.  But it is imperative for American security that ISIL be dismantled and we must keep up the fight.”	777822365609867
103286879730089	I enjoyed my time in Lockport yesterday.  First I met with area residents and listened to their concerns at my Senior Fair at John Olson American Legion Post 18.  Then I spent a beautiful summer evening at the Cruisin' into Lockport program at Central Square.  It was great to see so many familiar faces and make some new friends as well.	754874431237994
103286879730089	Twenty-five years ago today, two momentous events occurred that impacted the course of freedom in the world.  In China, communist government troops massacred peaceful democratic protesters in Tiananmen Square in Beijing.  The massacre was followed by a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy, pro-reform Chinese.  This terrible event overshadowed the re-birth of freedom in central and eastern Europe as Poland voted in its first partially-free election since WWII.  The victory of Solidarity in parliamentary elections sparked a wildfire of freedom that quickly led to the fall of the Iron Curtain and the defeat of Soviet communism.  On this anniversary, Poland is proudly celebrating Freedom Day.	723089891083115
103286879730089	I invite area veterans to a listening session I am hosting with Senator Kirk on Sunday, June 1st, at 2:00 p.m. at the VFW Post 2378 located at 1529 South Harlem Avenue, Berwyn, IL. Veterans will have the opportunity to share their experiences in regards to veteran hospitals. \n\nThe mistreatment of some veterans by the VA has been shameful. The resignation of Secretary Shinseki is a first step in cleaning up the system, but much more needs to be done to assure veterans of the treatment they deserve and to hold those responsible for neglect of veterans accountable. This will require reviews of all VA facilities. If you have suffered problems at Hines or any other VA facility please come forward and tell your story so you can help up fix the VA.	721412167917554
103286879730089	Following the release of the interim report from the Inspector General’s independent review of the growing VA scandal, it is becoming painfully clear that the problems extend well beyond the confines of one facility in Phoenix, Arizona.  VA Secretary Shinseki is a hero, who has served our country honorably for decades, but considering what has occurred under his watch, we owe it to the American people, especially our brave veterans, to begin a comprehensive review and reform of the entire VA operation with a change in leadership. \n\nWhile I do not believe that Shinseki was directly involved in the creation of any of the waiting lists or the subsequent obstruction of information, this problem is the result of a failure in the VA to match up their directives with available resources.  If the agency is going to establish a 14 day maximum wait for veterans to see a doctor, then they must assure that there are the doctors, nurses, medical rooms, etc. necessary to see that volume of patients.  That is the responsibility of the highest levels of management, and in this case, that is Secretary Shinseki.  His dismissal would not be the solution to this widespread systematic failure, but I believe it is a necessary step towards restoring the American people’s faith in the VA.   \n\nThe President should immediately nominate a capable individual to take the Secretary’s position, in order to assure strong top-level leadership at the VA, and the Administration and Congress need to do a thorough review not only of the management and care failures, but to ensure that we are effectively funding and resourcing the VA to handle the increased medical care demand they face.\n\nLocally, I will continue to direct my attention to the service our family, friends, and neighbors receive at the Hines VA facility.  And I call on all veterans to not be silent regarding problems they have encountered receiving care at Hines or any other VA health care center.	720692777989493
103286879730089	On this Memorial Day, I joined with local residents at ceremonies in Justice, Tinley Park, Beverly, Palos Park, and Orland Park to remember and honor the men and women that made the freedoms we often take for granted possible.  It warmed my heart to see hundreds of people at these ceremonies, including many young families and children ensuring that even as we sadly say goodbye each year to more of our aging heroes, there are people ready to make sure the stories and sacrifices of those that came before them are not forgotten.	718880564837381
103286879730089	The weather cooperated for a touching Memorial Day Observance in Worth this morning.

103286879730089	Today, the Senate Commerce Committee passed the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act, which contains Congressman Lipinski's American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act (AMCA).  If approved, the AMCA would bolster the competitiveness of manufacturers in the United States by requiring a panel of private and public experts to make recommendations every four years regarding policies that would boost traditional and high-tech manufacturers. \n\n“I thank Senators Kirk, Coons, and Pryor for their work on this legislation, and for their continued leadership on issues involving our nation’s manufacturing industry,” Rep. Lipinski said.  “This bipartisan legislation is about the public and private sectors working together to form a coordinated plan to help create more good-paying middle class jobs in this country.”	694165687308869

91052833204	A statement from the spokesman for Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-IL), reacting to comments regarding the humanitarian crisis of children fleeing violence that were made today by the Obama Administration, Speaker John Boehner, and others:\n\n“Congressman Gutiérrez has been clear that children fleeing violence in Central America should not be met by National Guard with fixed bayonets pushing them back across the bridge into Mexico.  The U.S. has a process to handle asylum seekers, those without visas, families, unaccompanied minors and victims of trafficking and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is following those procedures.  Bill O’Reilly’s idea of sending the National Guard to the border, which others are now parroting, is a naïve and aggressive knee-jerk reaction that is completely inappropriate in these circumstances. \n\n“The Congressman wants the children and families fleeing violence to be processed as quickly as possible so that we are not warehousing or detaining people before they face an asylum officer or immigration judge.  More asylum officers and judges are needed to handle the increased caseload and the Congressman supports efforts to give people, especially children, legal counsel when they go before a judge.  A ten year-old who does not speak English is clearly not capable of representing themselves opposite a government lawyer before an immigration judge.\n\n“Most of those coming here will be given a notice to appear in court before an immigration judge, the first step in the deportation process.  Congressman Gutiérrez does not support the idea of putting children and families fleeing violence in detention while they await our courts to catch up to the current crisis.  There are alternatives to detention like ankle bracelets and supervision to manage the backlog in processing that are much more humane and cost-effective than tax-payer funded public or for-profit detention centers.”	10152506465008205

158963645688	STATEMENT ON U.S. STRATEGY ON ISIS:\nISIS is a serious threat to the U.S. that must be defeated, and I support the thoughtful and deliberate counterterrorism strategy the president laid out this week. Allowing ISIS to continue to gain strength threatens our national security here at home and the security of our allies in the region. Defeating ISIS will require the U.S. to join our partners in the region in a broad international coalition, but I agree with the president that we cannot commit American boots on the ground. America is a war weary nation, and we cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of our past. In the days and weeks ahead, I look forward to hearing more from the president as he seeks input from Congress and believe he will find broad bipartisan support for this endeavor.	10152291168225689

The freeing of former PM Yulia Tymoshenko is an important first step, but there is a long road ahead. The US must stand by the Ukrainian people as they continue to fight for the democratic principles of free speech, free assembly, and a free and open press that we as Americans value so deeply.	800063273340627

280757931935749	#TAXBREAKS4STUDENTS\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Date:   February 27, 2015 \nContact:  Ira Cohen Phone: 773-533-7520\n\n“U.S. Congressman Danny K. Davis Leads #TaxBreaks4Students Publicity Campaign the Week of March 2nd to Encourage Students to Take Advantage of Educational Tax Breaks”\n\nWashington, D.C.- On February 27, 2015, Congressman Danny K. Davis (D-IL) announced that he is leading a publicity campaign to encourage eligible students and families to take the education tax breaks for which they qualify.  The #TaxBreaks4Students campaign during the week of March 2nd will increase awareness about education tax breaks and encourage students to check out IRS resources to see whether they qualify. It also engages education stakeholders, including colleges, universities, education associations, and student advocacy groups, to help increase understanding of these benefits. \n\nDavis said, “Tax-based education aid represents more than half of all non-loan federal aid, playing an important role in promoting college affordability and completion.  Unfortunately, the complexity of education tax benefits makes it difficult for students to understand whether they qualify for a benefit and which benefit best meets their needs.  Indeed, a study by the Government Accountability Office showed that 1.5 million tax filers who qualified for either the Tuition and Fees Deduction or the Lifetime Learning Credit did not claim the credit or deduction.  Many families do not realize that, even if they did not make enough money to owe taxes, the American Opportunity Tax Credit provides up to $1,000 for certain education expenses. I’m proud to join together with critical education stakeholders on this campaign to educate today’s students and families about the two education credits likely to help them the most – the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit.” \n\nI thank the following partners for their support of this campaign. Illinois partners include:  Blackburn University; Chicago State University; City Colleges of Chicago; Columbia College Chicago; DePaul University; Dominican University; Eastern Illinois University; Governors State University; Illinois Association for College Admission Counseling; Illinois Institute of Technology; Illinois State University; Loyola University Chicago; National Louis University; Northeastern Illinois University; Northern Illinois University; Northwestern University; Roosevelt University; South Suburban College; Southern Illinois University System; Triton College; University of Illinois at Chicago; University of Illinois; and Western Illinois University.\n\nNational partners include: American Association of Community Colleges (AACC); American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU); The American Council on Education (ACE); American Federation of Teachers (AFT); Asian American and Pacific Islander Association of Colleges and Universities (APIACU); Association of American Universities (AAU); Association of Community College Trustees (ACCT); Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU); Council for Opportunity in Education (COE); Council of Graduate Schools (CGS); Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU); Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP); National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO); National Association of College Stores (NACS); National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO); National Association of Graduate-Professional Students (NAGPS); National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU); National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA); National Council of La Raza (NCLR); National Indian Education Association (NIEA); National Urban League (NUL); The Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS); Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF); United States Student Association (USSA); U.S. PIRG; and Young Invincibles.  \n###	962148730463329
112300955610529	Today the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments on marriage equality.  I am confident that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of love and commitment, and bring marriage equality to the nation. That’s why I joined 166 of my colleagues in the House, along with 44 Senators, to write an amicus brief showing that Americans deserve the freedom to marry. \n\nWhile I was recovering at Walter Reed after being shot down in Iraq, my husband Bryan was at my bedside every day. Not only was he offering love and support during such a difficult time, but he was also making critical decisions for me that improved my quality of life. Often, those decisions were contrary to what other family members would have decided, but as my life partner, my husband knew me better and made the correct choices for me when I could not. I support the freedom to marry because everyone deserves the same level of access, support and love.	504003933106894

280757931935749	STATEMENT OF CONGRESSMAN DANNY K. DAVIS ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S STATE OF THE UNION OUTLINE OF A PLAN TO BRING FAIRNESS TO OUR TAX SYSTEM\n\nTonight President Obama laid out a plan to return our tax system to fairness, to one which works for the great mass of Americans not just for the 1% and the special interests. Putting our values back into our tax code will also help return our economy to sustainability and our neighborhoods to livability.\n\nThe extraordinary growth of inequality in recent years was, and remains, inextricably entwined with the Great Recession.  Massive inequality and the injustices which flow from the great imbalances which now infect our economic relations has rightfully been the focus of a great and largely positive grass roots national and international discussion. We have seen graphic proof of the failure of the policies austerity, of trickle-down economics, of deregulation, of corporate greed now threatening to return large sections of the world economy to crisis.\n\nOur own economy, while growing, is not growing at a rate or a manner which will return our economy to full health in the reasonable future. That discussion has helped to spur, to highlight and to elevate the need for urgent public policy changes.  \n\nThe President's State of the Union Message has helped to bring much needed light to a still too dark place: the crisis which still grips so many of our neighborhoods, so many of our towns and villages, so many of our people who need and deserve the opportunity to share in all that our nation's potential has to offer.   Repair of our tax code alone will not solve all of our economic problems.  But it is a critical, necessary part of the solution.\n\nI look forward to working with the President to move the national discussion forward and stir the Congress to move from paralysis and obstructionism to action and to adopt these tax proposals which many of us in the Congress have been advocating along with making the necessary public investments in education, infrastructure, research, health, raising the minimum wage, and protecting our pension system.\n\nCongressman Davis is a Member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee	938036196207916

280757931935749	Statement of Representative Danny K. Davis on the Congress agreement to end "Shutdown"\n\nI am pleased and relieved that the United States Congress has a vote scheduled on an agreement to end the shutdown of our government and raise the debt ceiling.  I plan to vote yes on the agreement as I now understand it.  \n\nI am disappointed that the agreement to end the shutdown only extends into January of 2014 and the agreement to raise the debt ceiling only extends until February 2014.  I am even more disappointed that the sequester will continue with no relief for those who have suffered its consequences.  \n\nThere is no acknowledgment of the cost and harm resulting from this shutdown and the threat to our nation’s economy.  If one were looking for winners and losers coming out of this totally unnecessary crisis one would have to say the winners were the American people who will see their government go back to work for them.  And the losers . . . the American people who will never recover either the direct costs of this shutdown or the lost opportunities due to the shutdown at a time when our economy is still struggling to put millions of Americans back to work, to save families from foreclosure, and to provide basic services including security, health care and education.\n\nNo progress has been made on the profound differences which have virtually paralyzed this Congress and no consensus has been reached on abandoning the tactics of holding our government and our economy hostage rather than engaging in honest debate and compromise.  Upon passage of this agreement the Congress must turn its attention to passing a budget and a vision of how we can effectively address the urgent needs of the American people along with a number of other pressing legislative issues.  I am eager to engage in that constructive process and trust that we will move forward in that vein without delay.\n\nCongressman Davis is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee	690554227622782
280757931935749	What the Government Shutdown Means for You\n\nOctober 2, 2013\n\nA government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to fund the government. This particular manufactured crisis was created after the far right in the House Republican Caucus insisted on delaying implementation of the protections found in the Affordable Care Act - legislation already approved by both chambers of Congress, signed by the President, and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. While a conversation on ways to improve the health care law is appropriate, to use the threat of a government shutdown to extract demands that the House Republican Caucus has been unsuccessful to achieve in the normal democratic process is reckless and inappropriate.\n\nEven though Congressman Davis has adamantly opposed the sequester and continues to oppose the sequester he has voted to accept the current budget level for the Continuing Resolution to keep the government open until a new budget can be negotiated.\n\nIronically, within the first twelve hours or so of the ACA insurance exchanges going live at midnight last night, Healthcare.gov has been visited 2.8 million times, according to HHS.  81,000 people have called 1-800-318-2596.\n\nDuring a government shutdown, the government stops all "non-essential" services, while essential services, such as the armed forces, border protection, air traffic controllers, and police and fire departments, will continue to operate. The Office of Congressman Davis will have staff available during the government shutdown to help constituents who are having difficulty accessing important federal government services.\n\nThe following is a list of frequently asked questions on how a government shutdown could impact you and your family.\n\nWhat Services Will Be Stopped?\n\nEconomy\n\n* A one week shutdown will cost the economy about $10 billion\n* Hundreds of thousands of Federal employees immediately and indefinitely furloughed, and many Federal employees and contractors that continue to work not paid during the shutdown.\n* SBA stops approving applications for small businesses to obtain loans and loan guarantees, typically more than $1 billion per month.Housing loans to low and middle income families in rural communities put on hold, as well as start-up business loans for farmers and ranchers.\n* Projects to improve rail and other mass transit infrastructure will cease as nearly 1,300 grantees lose access to federal funds.\n* Commercial export sales halted.\n* Federal economic reports used by businesses and investors not released.\n* The government will stop or delay environmental reviews of planned transportation and energy-related projects, keeping companies from working on these projects.\n* Army Corps of Engineers construction stopped, hurting private companies and preventing job creation, and closure or reduced hours for 2,500 Corps of Engineers Sites.\n* The Administration on Children and Families (ACF) will not be able to award new TANF and child care grants, which provide a lifeline to low-income working families.\n* National parks, Smithsonian museums, and other federal lands closed immediately, negatively affecting local economies dependent on tourism.\n\nNational Security and Public Safety\n\n* Approximately 72 percent of the Intelligence community's civilian workforce furloughed.\n* Physical protection for diplomatic personnel and facilities in dangerous locations overseas compromised, and risk assessments to inform advisory warnings for American tourists and corporations overseas restricted.\n* Security assistance and counterterrorism aid for critical allies like Israel curtailed.\n* Delays in technology upgrades put us at greater risk for cyber attacks.\n* Federal efforts to enhance vehicle safety, aviation safety, and modernize our air traffic control system cease and aviation safety inspectors furloughed.\n* Training curtailed for federal law enforcement agents.\n* Chemical Facility Anti-terrorism Standards program closes down after October 4th.\n\nVeterans\n\n* VA call centers and hotlines cease to function, and VBA Regional Offices public contact services not available.\n* No decisions issued on claims appeals or motions.\n* Recruiting and hiring of Veteran job applicants cease.\n* Claims processing and payments in the compensation, pension, education, and vocational rehabilitation programs suspended when available funding is exhausted in late October.\n* The federal bureau responsible for providing specialized and targeted employment and training services to veterans will cease to operate.\n\nHealth, Education, and Research\n\n* Federal assistance to school districts, colleges and universities, and vocational rehabilitation agencies severely curtailed.\n* Important government research into life-threatening diseases, environmental protection, and other areas halted.\n* NIH shuts down most medical research taking place on its Bethesda campus, stop admitting new patients into its research hospital, and stop reviewing grant applications and making or renewing research grants.\n* CDC to greatly curtail its activities to promote immunization, detect outbreaks of infectious diseases, support state and local health departments, and update disease treatment and prevention recommendations.\n* CMS unable to continue discretionary funding for health care fraud and abuse.\n* FDA unable to support majority of food safety, nutrition, and cosmetics activities.\n\nLegislation signed evening of Monday, September 30th ensures that servicemembers will be paid during potential government shutdown.\n\nWill I Still Get My Social Security Benefits?\n\n Current law suggests that the Social Security Administration has the authority to continue mailing checks, as was the case during the last government shutdown in 1996. Though checks will continue to mail, a number of Social Security employees will be furloughed, which means new Social Security claims may not be processed. You should expect delays if you need to contact the Social Security Administration.\n\nWill Veteran Benefits Continue?\n\n While VA hospitals will remain open, the last government shutdown saw many veterans' access to benefits reduced.\n\nWill Unemployment Benefits Be Affected?\n\n Depending on the length of the shutdown, the federal funds that help states pay the costs of their unemployment programs could run out, which would require the state to step in and advance the money to keep their programs running. This is not an immediate consequence of a government shutdown but a possible outcome depending on the length.\n\nWill Passports and Visas Be Impacted?\n\nYes. You should expect delays processing passport and visa requests during a government shutdown. If you have foreign travel plans over the next several months, you are highly encouraged to begin your paperwork as soon as possible.\n\nWill I Still Have Access to My Medicare?\n\nIf you are currently enrolled in Medicare, your coverage should continue as usual. If there is a complication with your coverage, you should expect delays when contacting Medicare. If you become eligible for Medicare during the shutdown, there may be delays in your enrollment. Please call our office if you experience a delay in your enrollment.\n\nAre Claims with the IRS Impacted?\n\n There may be delayed tax refunds during this government shutdown. The extent to which this problem manifests depends on the length of the shutdown.\n\nWhat Services Will Continue?\n\nServices that are deemed essential for the safety of human life and the protection of property will be continued. This includes the armed forces, border patrol, police, fire fighting, and federal workers who provide medical care on the job. The Postal Service and the Federal Reserve, which are both self-funded, will also continue to operate. Most state services will not be directly impacted.\n\nCongressional Pay\n\nThe 27th amendment says no change can be made to Congressional pay until at least one federal congressional election takes place. This was meant to block Congress from voting itself immediate pay increases, but has the related effect of making it impossible to cancel Congress' pay.

280757931935749	Statement of Congressman Danny K. Davis on Military Intervention in Syria\n\nThe apparent use of chemical weapons in Syria is a human tragedy and our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives.  Much remains unknown about these events as of today and the Congress is beginning a debate on the issue.\n\nMy constituents are deeply concerned about events in Syria and they are searching for an appropriate response which will end the killing and move quickly toward a political solution to the war in Syria.  However they are overwhelmingly opposed to U.S. military intervention of any kind.  They are concerned about the morality of such action, they are concerned about the legality of such action, they are concerned about the loss of life resulting from such action, they are concerned about the effectiveness, or lack of effectiveness, of such action, they are concerned about such action involving us more deeply in the Civil War in Syria, they are concerned about what follow on conflict such action might trigger, they are concerned about sabotaging a possible agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons, they are concerned about the drawing resources and focus from critical immediate problems here at home.  I share all of those concerns and more.\n\nI have been, and remain today, a staunch support of President Obama.  However, my first responsibility as a Member of Congress is to represent the interests and views of my constituents.  Calls, emails, letters and other forms of communication with my office are running 9 to 1 in opposition to any military intervention in Syria at this time.  Therefore, I am strongly leaning toward a NO vote on any military intervention.  I intend to continue to listen closely to President Obama’s statements and to the views of my constituents as this debate proceeds.	672038816140990

112300955610529	Today, I was proud to sign onto an amicus brief in the marriage equality cases that are on appeal to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court and Congress need to grant all Americans - gay or straight - the ability to protect their partner. While I was recovering at Walter Reed after being shot down in Iraq, my husband Bryan was at my bedside every day. Not only was he offering love and support during such a difficult time, but he was also making critical decisions for me that improved my quality of life. Often, those decisions were contrary to what other family members would have decided, but as my life partner, my husband knew me better and made the correct choices for me when I could not. I support the freedom to marry because everyone deserves the same level of access, support and love.	475313705975917

160143957118	On Monday, in celebration of Flag Day, I had the honor of presenting Hollywood House with an American Flag that was flown over the United States Capitol on April 29th, 2015. Hollywood House’s commitment to helping seniors maintain affordable housing exemplifies the patriotism that Flag Day represents. Also, as a first generation American, I believe it is important to embrace the fact that we are a nation of immigrants, and that America is truly a place where people come from all over to have the opportunity to work hard, raise a family, live a free, have a secure retirement and a decent life. Happy Belated Flag Day!	10153849244227119
160143957118	In its current form, the Trade Deal does not protect workers, consumers or the environment. It does not prevent currency manipulation by other countries. Tobacco controls can be undone and medicines would not reach the people who need them the most. These are some of the reasons why we need to stop “fast-track” in its tracks.	10153847738802119
160143957118	Yesterday, I participated in a press conference against the #FastTrack legislation that the House plans to vote on later this week. I #FightFastTrack because I find it irresponsible to pass a bill that would not allow us to weigh in on what would be an economically damaging trade deal. We already know that TPP would cost us American jobs and drive down wages. We also know that TPP would increase the cost of lifesaving drugs for people in the US and in other countries. Please help us keep up the fight against Fast Track.	10153835882837119
323631667743052	Great day at Scott Air Force Base with Governor Bruce Rauner,  Congressman John Shimkus, and former Congressman Jerry Costello discussing the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and other growth opportunities for Southwestern Illinois.	682567658516116
160143957118	It was great to recognize the U.S. Department of Education's  Green Ribbon Award winners for 2015 last week. This national award was given to 81 schools across the country, and recognizes schools that are reducing environmental impacts and costs, improving the health and wellness of their students and staff, and incorporating environmental education, STEM, civic skills, and green career pathways for their students. I'm proud that River Trails Middle School in Mount Prospect, Illinois was one of the winners. Congrats to everyone from the students to the superintendent. Parents, teachers and administrators should be proud as well!	10153830569322119
160143957118	I will continue to stand with my Congressional colleagues and others in support of #BringBackOurGirls	10153820747367119
160143957118	I want to thank Block Steel, headquartered in Skokie, Illinois, for allowing me to visit their distribution center last Friday. It’s a shining example of how we keep American jobs at home! I’m introducing the Patriot Employer Tax Credit Act of 2015 to help businesses, like Block Steel, thrive. We must stop rewarding corporations that ship jobs overseas, underpay their workers and offer inadequate benefits. Instead, we can reward patriotic employers, like Block Steel. To learn more see this Chicago Tribune  article: http://goo.gl/luU3X9 and this Illinois Radio Network report: http://goo.gl/sps1Xm	10153798176452119
160143957118	I received so many great questions from Chicago's Sacred Heart Academy 8th grade class during their visit to Congress. It’s a testament to their teachers, parents and their own hard work in the classrooms.	10153788066672119
160143957118	I joined the USO for its biannual USO Care Package Service Project event on Capitol Hill last week to express my gratitude in a small way to those who serve us. Our service women and men do so much for our country. I was very grateful to join the USO to make them care packages,sign their banner of support. I also wrote a couple cards for our troops. #USOmoments	10153788046492119
160143957118	I joined Leader Pelosi, House Democratic women and women from across the country to discuss our Women’s Economic Agenda, from higher pay and an end to the gender gap to a robust Older Americans Act re-authorization. Our mission is not just possible but essential because when Women Succeed,  America succeeds! For more information click here: http://goo.gl/gh3jga	10153766053492119
160143957118	I was thrilled to celebrate the three winners of this year’s Artistic Discovery competition. I enjoy this competition each year, and year after year I am amazed at the creativity and skill displayed by all applicants. All three winners from the 9th Congressional District of Illinois deserve high praise. You see each of them and their works of art below.	10153761369267119
160143957118	Proud to stand up with and speak out for The Progressive Agenda with Mayor Bill de Blasio and many other Progressive leaders. A majority of Americans support our agenda, which raises wages, support unions, protects and strengthens Social Security -- and much more. #p2agenda	10153745374147119
160143957118	Chicago has lost an influential leader. I'll remember Cardinal George with special gratitude for his steadfast advocacy on behalf of immigrants.	10153684388222119
160143957118	We all should pause and honor President Lincoln today. His life was taken 150 years ago today, but our union lives on because of his leadership.	10153679365117119
160143957118	Today the Congressional Progressive Caucus held a forum in support of low wage workers. We heard from workers, business leaders and researchers. We will continue to #Fightfor15 and a union -- along with increased worker rights.	10153679155267119
160143957118	It was great learning about LiveWatch Security during the Internet of Things showcase yesterday.	10153628927787119
160143957118	Today I met with Santonio Holmes Jr., former Chicago Bears player and NFL Super Bowl XLIII MVP. His cause? Talking about the need for Sickle Cell research. His son suffers from Sickle Cell Disease and it has impacted his family. Please help increase support for this research.	10153610074162119
160143957118	It was a pleasure and a privilege to attend the Women's History Month Reception today to honor the women of the Supreme Court! All four, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor were present. They are an inspiration to us all.	10153609999547119
160143957118	I’m appalled at GOP Senators' recent letter to Iran. This attempt to undermine & scuttle negotiations is unprecedented & unacceptable.	10153588562737119
160143957118	Huge congrats to all the brave Wal-Mart workers who stood up, spoke out & won a raise to $10/hr! The #FightFor15 continues!	10153545221452119
160143957118	Yesterday, I spoke at a briefing on rising inequality and its impact on Social Security. Great discussion, as Social Security celebrates its 80th anniversary we must protect and expand this program on behalf of the millions of Americans who rely on it. #NoCuts	10153524294462119
160143957118	Hardworking American families should be cheering for our President. Great speech. Great vision. Great plan. #SOTU	10153473025577119
160143957118	I really enjoyed today's Scholarship Breakfast in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. As he said “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” We must keep fighting until justice and equality become a reality for all Americans.	10153470390362119
160143957118	We've witnessed hatred & intolerance in its most brutal form. Those of us who stand for life & liberty are all Parisians today. #ParisAttacks	10153448348242119
160143957118	Last night, it was my pleasure to commend the great Congressman John Conyers, Jr.on 50 years of service in the U.S. Congress. What a great progressive leader in our country. I am honored to serve with him!	10153446085377119
160143957118	I strongly believe that #AllLivesMatter and I stand against the killing of the two NYPD officers. This violence must stop.	10153376677662119
401029529980053	I extend my sincerest condolences to the families of Eyal Yifrah, Naftali Frenkel and Gilad Sha’ar, as well as to all the people of Israel.  As a father, I can’t fully convey the sadness I feel in learning of these young boys’ death, nor can I imagine the anguish of their parents.\n\nThe kidnapping and murder of three teenage students—children just ages 16 and 19—is an outrage and shows the cowardice, brutality and lack of humanity of the perpetrators. Hamas is an internationally recognized terrorist organization and should be treated as such.  \n\nI pray for comfort for the Yifrah, Frenkel and Sha'ar families in their time of mourning, and I pray that the people responsible for these children’s death are swiftly brought to justice.	666043156812021
323631667743052	April is Child Abuse Prevention Month in Illinois. Today I joined Director Sheldon of the IL Dept. of Children and Family Services (DCFS), State Rep. Tim Butler, and the most important voice in the room, Val Eyer, a remarkable young girl who was removed from an abusive home, who shared her story with us.	683331205106428
401029529980053	While it is premature to judge without knowing the details of the agreed-to terms of extension, I remain concerned about the announcement today, especially if it gives Iran sanctions relief without bringing sufficient pressure on Iran to end its nuclear programs nor curb its nuclear ambitions. But I also know no deal is better than a bad deal and remain committed to working toward a potential deal that peacefully brings Iran’s activities to a close in a permanent and verifiable manner.\n\nRepeating my previous statements, any agreement must move Iran off the path toward nuclear weapons capability with terms that ensure Iran has no fortified nuclear facilities, such as Fordow, no heavy water reactor, such as under construction at Arak, and no enrichment capacity that would allow it to produce sufficient weapons grade uranium to “break out” a nuclear device. I believe an agreement must also include unlimited and unfettered access to all nuclear related facilities and full, unqualified disclosure of Iran’s previous nuclear activities. Finally, a satisfactory agreement must be one that is enforced for an extended period of time, best measured in generations rather than years.\n\nAnd importantly, any potential agreement that would lead to a potential lessening of the sanctions pressure on Iran must be presented to Congress for approval. It was Congress that established the sanctions, and only with Congressional approval should they be altered.	763738063709196
401029529980053	The magnitude and significance of the challenges posed by our broken immigration system demand a comprehensive, long-term solution that only Congressional action can fully provide, but House Republican’s absolute unwillingness to act necessitated the President’s decision. \n \nThe President's executive action will expand opportunities for immigrants seeking lawful employment in the United States, providing much-needed relief for up to 5 million people currently living in the shadows. It also refocuses our enforcement resources toward individuals who pose a legitimate threat, while limiting the needless separating of families. \n \nComprehensive immigration reform by Congress would benefit our nation by strengthening communities, fueling economic growth and opening the door to tackling so many other challenges we face.  I hope that the President's announcement will help reignite progress on building a lasting, permanent solution.	761892647227071
401029529980053	The heinous and gruesome murder of Jews at prayer in synagogue is nothing short of a despicable act of terror. I grieve for all the victims and their families, including the four rabbis and the Druze policeman, and extend my sincerest condolences to all the people of Israel.  \n\nThere is simply no place for such violence, and I call on the entire international community to unequivocally condemn this brutal attack. In particular, I call on President Abbas to end the incitement that leads to such attacks. On a personal note, I met Rabbi Twersky on some of my many visits to Israel and knew him to be both a scholar and exceptionally kind man.	761390623943940
401029529980053	In 1992, President Bill Clinton famously declared that everyone who works hard and plays by the rules deserves the opportunity to get ahead and provide a brighter future for their children.  Unfortunately, we as a nation fail to live up to this promise far too often – many Americans are working harder than ever, putting in longer hours and yet with little to show for it.\n \nToday, we celebrate National Minimum Wage Day to highlight the importance of increasing the minimum wage to a livable wage.  I call on Congress to pass the Fair Minimum Wage Act, because no full-time worker should have to raise a family in poverty.	735325903217079
401029529980053	Today the Supreme Court rejected petitions to review lower court rulings that struck down state bans on same-sex marriage.\n \nWhile I am happy that all loving couples in Indiana, Wisconsin, Utah, Oklahoma and Virginia will be able to make the life-long commitment of marriage, we must continue our quest to ensure that same-sex couples are afforded equal rights under the law. I look forward to the day when all loving couples are able to get married.	730713813678288
401029529980053	Attended President Obama’s speech on the economy at my alma mater, Northwestern University. President Obama nailed it – while the economy is slowly recovering, that recovery isn’t being felt equally. The foundation has been laid, but we still have much to do.\n \nTo build lasting, broad-based prosperity we need to be focused on adding good quality jobs that will help grow our economy from the middle out. That’s why I’ve focused my efforts in Congress on closing the skills gap so that businesses can hire more workers that have the skills and the knowhow to help companies and our economy grow.	725022280914108
401029529980053	Shana Tovah! Wishing you and your family a sweet new year!	720404344709235
401029529980053	None of us will ever forget where we were on that dreadful day thirteen years ago, and our hearts will forever be with those who lost their lives and the families who lost their loved ones.\n\nOver a decade later, our nation’s resolve has never been stronger. Moving forward, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to freedom and justice, and never cease in our efforts to confront the forces that threaten those eternal liberties that we are all endowed with.	714661041950232
401029529980053	The U.S. can not and should not put American troops back into Iraq, but as a nation founded on the principles of tolerance and in opposition to religious repression, we can’t stand idly by when as many as 40,000 people are left to starve on a mountain. \n\nThat’s why I support the President’s limited airstrikes against ISIS and the airdrop of critically needed humanitarian aid to Iraqi civilians fleeing the brutal attacks of ISIS. The United States must help protect the Yazidis, Christians and others threatened by ISIS simply for their faith.	688088784607458
401029529980053	The ongoing flood of unaccompanied minors fleeing their home countries and seeking refuge in the United States is a growing humanitarian crisis demanding urgent Congressional action. \n\nThe US must ensure that our process for evaluating individual refugee claims reflects the principles, values and compassion at the core of our national identity and sadly, yesterday's Republican measure failed to meet that crucial standard.	684521444964192
401029529980053	With so many important challenges left to address--reforming our immigration system, extending unemployment insurance, reauthorizing the Export-Import bank and ensuring equal pay for equal work--I sent a letter to Speaker Boehner this week urging him to keep Congress in session until we tackle issues.	684166764999660
401029529980053	Families in Israel are once again hearing incessant alarm sirens and racing to bomb shelters as Hamas launches hundreds of rockets from Gaza targeting Israeli civilians. \n \nNo nation would, nor should accept such attack without firm response. I support Israel’s right to defend herself against threats to her citizens and efforts to restore quiet to the region.	671179809631689
401029529980053	Honored that my bill to toughen sanctions on Hezbollah passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee today. \n\nRight now, Hezbollah uses its global financial connections to launder money and help fund terrorist activities. This bill will help stifle that financial network and give the United States more tools to crack down on Hezbollah’s global terrorist activities.	663166627099674
401029529980053	VA Secretary Eric Shinseki has served his country bravely and with distinction, and he is unquestionably deeply committed to serving our veterans. \n\nHowever, I believe the circumstances at the VA make it all but impossible for him to lead the urgent changes the VA needs and our veterans deserve. Therefore, I agree the time has come for Secretary Shinseki to step aside and allow a new leader to move the VA forward.	649045565178447
401029529980053	One hallmark of the United States is the willingness of its citizens to take up arms and defend it—defend its virtues, its values and its ideals around the world. \n\nIt is our duty to honor their service, to thank them, to care for them and to commemorate the memories of those who are no longer with us.	646897002059970
401029529980053	Happy Mother's Day!	639686756114328
401029529980053	For all those who are celebrating today, I wish you a very happy and special Easter!	628629333886737
401029529980053	Disappointed that the Paycheck Fairness Act failed in Senate today. Equal work should mean equal pay, pure and simple.	622638931152444
401029529980053	The House should take immediate action on the Senate’s bipartisan compromise today to extend unemployment. I respect my colleagues' right to disagree, but not even holding a vote is unacceptable. \n\nFailing to extend this critical lifeline hurts our communities, hurts our families and hurts our economic recovery. More than 2 million Americans, including more than 150,000 in Illinois, deserve better than this partisan gridlock.	621890041227333
401029529980053	My deepest thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families in Fort Hood tonight.	619569594792711
401029529980053	Budgets are about priorities, and the Ryan Budget simply flies in the face of our core values—it hurts our middle class, our students and our seniors. \n\nInstead of moving our country forward and focusing on ways to grow the economy, this budget guts education funding, ends the Medicare guarantee and puts the burden on those who can afford it the least.  I stand in strong opposition to the misguided priorities of the Ryan Budget.	619089784840692
401029529980053	Proud to be the first Illinois member of Congress to join The Chicago Council on Global Affairs' Group of 500 that's calling for comprehensive immigration reform. Smart immigration reform is essential if we are to achieve the robust, sustainable growth necessary to secure our long-term economic future.	605886379494366
102918290599	Today I went to the 6th Annual Greenfest in Aurora. It was great to see the work being done to make our community more eco-friendly and a better place for us all.	10153306317785600
102918290599	This morning I went to Joliet Public Library’s 6th Annual Star Wars Day. It was great to see young people excited about reading and using their imagination. Too bad my Chewbacca costume was at the dry cleaner…	10153291432325600
102918290599	This morning I spoke with small business owners at the Illinois Department of Central Management Services’ Making a Connection event. Local entrepreneurs are learning about networking, doing business in our state, and including diversity in their workforce at Wabonsee Community College’s Aurora Campus.	10153289167900600
102918290599	Yesterday I visited students at Fred Rodgers Magnet Academy in Aurora to participate in a special tornado experiment with the WTTW11 children’s show Moochie Kalala. I met some really curious and smart kids interested in science and physics.	10153217155190600
102918290599	I ran into Brownie Troop 50863 while I was out in Naperville with my daughter this weekend. Nice to meet you all!	10153215206870600
102918290599	I’m looking forward to seeing some old friends at Star Wars Day at Joliet Public Library. Until then, #MayThe4thBeWithYou\nhttp://jolietlibrary.org/starwarsday	10153200785110600
102918290599	It's wonderful to see so many coming out in support of the #FreedomToMarry as the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments on marriage equality. \n\nEarlier this year, I joined 166 of my colleagues in the House and 44 in the Senate to write an Amicus brief that says all Americans deserve the right to marry who they love.	10153187296220600
102918290599	This weekend I talked with DREAMers in Aurora and Joliet who want to serve in the Armed Forces. The President can and should take executive action now to allow these young men and women to serve the country they love.	10152784803290600
102918290599	This morning I spoke with students at Sator Sanchez Elementary School in Joliet during their Veterans Day assembly. Thanks to the veterans for sharing their experiences with the students.	10152763718735600
102918290599	This morning I had had the chance to join the groundbreaking for DMDII, an exciting new project to boost manufacturing and innovation here in Illinois. This state of the art digital manufacturing lab will support innovators and entrepreneurs and help strengthen our role as a hub for 21st century manufacturing.	10152746266860600
102918290599	I’d like to thank all of the employers and job seekers who came to the hiring event on Friday. We had a great turnout and I am looking forward to hearing all of the success stories. To find out about upcoming job fairs and other events, sign up for my email list at https://foster.house.gov/contact/newsletter	10152725547785600
102918290599	Indian Prairie Public Library is asking us to share our favorite books. I chose The Meaning of Relativity by Albert Einstein, which my father passed down to me. What are your favorite books?	10152717245080600
102918290599	This weekend I stopped by SciTech Hands On Museum in Aurora where students were competing for a chance to go to the national championships of the World Robotics Olympiad. Congrats to everyone who participated!	10152626281695600
102918290599	Took a step back in time today with a trip to Naper Settlement	10152620839270600
102918290599	This weekend at Montgomery Fest I got to drive a robot designed and built by local students. Thanks to the Robotics Club from Oswego High School and Oswego East High School for showing me how it’s done! #ScienceGeek #STEM	10152555482565600
102918290599	This week, I continued my Project Growth initiative to support jobs and economic growth in our community by visiting local businesses, including Schorr Packaging in Aurora, United Express Systems in Naperville and TLC Ingredients in Lockport. As your representative, talking directly with businesses and employers to learn about the challenges and opportunities they face is an important priority.\n\nTo learn more about Project Growth, please visit www.foster.house.gov.	10152412809460600
102918290599	During National Small Business Week, I joined the Aurora Regional Chamber of Commerce for a tour of small businesses in our community.  Small businesses are vital to our local community and they are the backbone of our national economy.	10152367319735600
102918290599	Proud of my staff who volunteered to do their part on Downtown Joliet Cleanup Day along with Joliet Mayor Tom Giarrante and the Joliet Slammers. Thanks to everyone who participated!	10152352612825600
102918290599	This weekend I had the chance to meet with constituents throughout the district.  I met with young artists at the 131 Fine Arts Festival, kids giving back to their community at the Aurora Youth Summit, and members of SPARK Aurora supporting early childhood education.  \n\nLet me know about your group event at https://foster.house.gov/contact/invite-me-to-speak	10152298215115600
102918290599	It was an honor to welcome our World War II veterans that traveled to Washington, D.C. with Honor Flight Chicago. \n \nThese brave Americans sacrificed and endured so much so that we can enjoy the freedoms we have today.  For that, we owe them our eternal gratitude.	10152288031590600
102918290599	Today we remember the lives tragically lost at Sandy Hook Elementary one year ago. \n\nUnfortunately, far too many here in Illinois and throughout the country continue to be the victims of gun violence. \n\nWe can and must do more to prevent these senseless tragedies.	10152057858180600
102918290599	Happy Thanksgiving!  I'm thankful for the time I'll spend with friends and family today.   What are you thankful for?	10152022123190600
102918290599	Today we honor our nation’s veterans. For many of us they are friends and family, to all of us they are heroes. \n\nMy own father served during World War II. I learned that the experience of serving during a war is something our veterans carry with them for a lifetime.  We owe it to our returning veterans to make sure they get the mental and physical care they deserve, and the services they need to help them re-integrate into civilian life.	10151975597745600
102918290599	My staff and I are safe in our Washington, DC office.  We're all thankful for the dedicated Capitol Police and first responders.	10151891809705600
102918290599	Because of the thousands of Americans who have fought for workers’ rights – living wages, safe working conditions and a forty hour work week – America has the strongest middle class the world has ever seen.\n\nAmerica’s middle class is the backbone of our Democracy and as we continue our recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression, it is critical that we support middle class workers.  This means preparing our workers for 21st Century jobs with education and training.  It also means passing pro-growth policies like the Senate immigration bill, which will encourage the creation of new businesses here in America.	10151827203675600
527281100637880	Two years ago, I was asked to run for Congress. I was asked to represent the talented, caring, hard working people of Southern Illinois.  And little did I know just how much I would gain from that experience.  \n\nIt has been an honor to represent Southern Illinoisans in Washington DC.  To hear your passion for our region, to learn about the concerns of farmers, teachers, law enforcement officers, miners, and veterans - that has been the driving force behind my two years in office.  And I thank you for making your voice heard.\n\nI want to thank my family for the sacrifices they have made, the tough schedules, the time apart, the endless traveling.  I look forward to spending more time at home, and enjoying my family.  Thank you for always understanding.\n\nMy staff and volunteers have given of themselves over the last two years, and they deserve more thanks than I can give.  I've had the great fortune of working with some of the most talented and compassionate people in Southern Illinois, and it was incredible to see them in action.  Annette and I wish them luck with their future endeavors, and can't wait to see what they do next.\n\nLastly, I want to thank the constituents of the 12th Congressional District of Illinois.  It was a pleasure to assist with veterans' disability cases, social security cases, navigating the ACA, fighting for farmers and coal miners, and strengthening the future of Scott Air Force Base.\n\nI wish Congressman-Elect Bost the best of luck as he enters the halls of Congress.  I ask that he remember the overwhelming support for a higher minimum wage, the need for public debate on EPA regulations, and the importance of fighting for our veterans' healthcare needs - and may he work to represent the hardworking values of Southern Illinois.\n\nThank you,\n\nBill	905069029525750

527281100637880	I had the pleasure of spending the morning with Mary Cooley of the Belleville News-Democrat, discussing some of the more memorable moments of the past two years in office.  Some great memories, and many more pieces of legislation still left to fight for!	898399126859407
527281100637880	Coming off the tragic events of Pearl Harbor in 1941, this day in history the United States entered WWII.  It is days like today, not just Veterans' Day, that we should take a moment to honor those that make up "The Greatest Generation."  Thank you to all those who served.	890394430993210
527281100637880	Spent part of the day with students at Lindenwood University - Belleville talking about the law of mass communications and the Citizens United decision.  Thanks for having me LU!	883928698306450

527281100637880	Veterans' Day has a unique meaning for each of us.  To me, I'm reminded of my father's service, my brother's service, my uncles, and my grandfathers.  I'm reminded of the thousands of men and women in uniform I commanded in the Guard.  And most of all, I'm reminded of those that gave the last full measure of devotion to their country.  Today, and everyday, let us remember their sacrifices. \n\nWhat does Veterans' Day mean to you?	875460505819936

527281100637880	Yesterday, I had the pleasure of spending time with the outstanding women of Opal's House.  Opal's House is a home for homeless female veterans and actively drilling Guardswomen.  The mission of this organization is incredible, and as a veteran myself, it was an honor to hear their stories.  We owe a debt of gratitude to Opal's House and the volunteers that dedicate their time.	870286206337366

527281100637880	While I'm working here in Southern Illinois, I've found a great backup for my Washington office - Wayne Edwards from Johnston City is a 91 year old WWII veteran who served in the South Pacific.  We were able to treat him and his family to a great tour of the Capitol!	857289994303654
527281100637880	Today - I've been talking about the importance of continued action on veterans' issues.  Now is not the time to forget about our veterans' health care needs, now is the time to make sure we see our funding and health care improvement efforts put to work!	856078667758120

323631667743052	Last week, I visited the Operating Engineers Local 520 Training Facility in St. Jacob, IL where I was able to test out some of the equipment.  Apparently, I would make a better operating engineer than my colleague Rep. Mike Bost who knocked over the bucket.  Nothing like a little friendly competition!	708367419269473

323631667743052	Why I voted for the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act:\n\n“My constituents deserve to know what is in a nuclear deal negotiated with Iran and be able to trust that any final agreement will effectively stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb,” said Davis. “Unfortunately, I fear the concessions made by the president in the current framework are too great and safeguards to hold Iran accountable for their end of the deal are insufficient. We have a responsibility to the American people to ensure this deal does not end up strengthening the nuclear program of the world’s largest state-sponsor of terrorism.”\n\nMore here: http://rodneydavis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398663	701364836636398

323631667743052	Today Congressman John Shimkus and I visited Gifford, IL to see the recovery and rebuilding efforts from the November 2013 storms and to highlight the need to reform FEMA's disaster declaration process so that when small towns in large states like Illinois have millions in damages, they will get the help they need. Our bipartisan, bicameral legislation would do just that: http://rodneydavis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398625	685622691543946
323631667743052	This week I toured the Clinton Power Plant and met with plant leaders and employees about the importance of nuclear energy as part of a diverse energy portfolio and the thousands of jobs it produces in Illinois.	684081051698110
323631667743052	Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit Champaign Fire Station 1 and meet with Associated Fire Fighters of Illinois President Pat Devaney, Champaign Local 1260 President Chris Zaremba, Urbana Local 1147 President Steve Doggett, Legislative Liaison Chuck Sullivan, and AFL-CIO Community Service Liaison Bradley Diel.

186221644739359	I want the United States to get the best deal it can when negotiating trade agreements. But my constituents and I are rightfully concerned about the President’s executive overreach, and I have opposed his executive actions repeatedly and forcefully. Based on those past actions, I don’t trust the President to stay within legal and constitutional bounds. That’s why I supported TPA.\n\nTPA gives the American people more oversight and scrutiny over any deal negotiated by the President and allows us to put forth our best offers. TPA does not bypass the authority of Congress and facilitate ‘secret’ trade deals made behind the backs of the American people. Instead, it gives Congress the power to review the actual trade agreements in question—Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), for instance.\n\nI have read the documents related to TPP in the U.S. Capitol, and I will continue to monitor them as negotiations progress.\n\nWhen I entered Congress, I promised to keep and bring back jobs to Illinois and the 14th District. Trade’s benefit to Illinois’ economy and the many families whose jobs rely on exporting to other countries is evident. Our manufacturing businesses depend on opening foreign markets.\n\nBottom line: TPA doesn’t equal TPP, TTIP or any other trade deal. TPA puts Congress in the driver’s seat. It’s the means by which Congress holds the President accountable and ensures Americans can have confidence in the transparency of any potential deal. The end result must work for the 14th District or I won’t support it.	1068774259817422
186221644739359	Another great fly-in of WWII vets on Honor Flight Chicago today! Met folks from Oak Brook, Mt. Prospect, Niles, Lisle and other Illinoisians. We don't need to wait until November 11 to honor the brave men and women who have served our country.	1058290090865839
186221644739359	My staff and I were honored to host civil rights hero and fellow Congressman John Lewis and his staff today to share coffee, donuts and conversation as we work on building friendships and together pursue positive solutions for the country. There are many areas of common ground where we must find a way to work together. We must work to continue to fight against barriers that still exist in America.	1050483454979836
186221644739359	This morning, I hosted key Illinois veterans affairs leaders and local veterans to discuss updates in veteran servicing and updates in VA reform. My speakers touched on several highlights, including an a 87% improvement on claims backlog in the Chicago Regional office since 2013. We also learned that since the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, a bill I supported, was signed into law last July, more than 11,000 veterans are receiving care through the Choice Act program at Hines VA Hospital, and more than 1,000 at Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center.\n\nTimely and quality care for our veterans is a top priority for me in Congress. I look forward to improved channels of communication among the leadership and between them and Illinois veterans at large.	1046637355364446
186221644739359	Acres Group is a family-owned business providing landscaping and snow removal services to our area since 1983. During this #SmallBizWeek, I visited their Wauconda facility and spoke to both employer and employee about the labor challenges they face, and how we can work together to promote Illinois businesses and workers. #SBW2015	1044309515597230
186221644739359	My staff and I had a wonderful time building relationships with Congresswoman Janice Hahn and her staff this morning in my Washington office over coffee and donuts. We may not always agree on everything across the aisle, but working on what we can agree on--which is probably 80% of the issues--helps us to find solutions to our nation's toughest problems. We can then agree to disagree on the other 20% without being divisive.	1041070739254441
186221644739359	Since we came together in March of last year to figure out how to develop a community-based approach to fighting the growing epidemic, I am prouder of how our communities have worked hard to implement the recommendations that came out of the forum.\n\nAs overdose deaths continue to afflict Will County, leaders have put in the time and energy to find compassionate solutions to this incredibly complex problem.\n\nToday, I highlighted the challenges and successes at the 2015 Hero Helps Community Summit, which focused on “Next Steps” in the community’s public health response to the heroin overdose epidemic.	1029456653749183
186221644739359	Had a blast talking about the importance of financial literacy during #FinancialLiteracyMonth with Sandwich Community High School students.Some of the best financial decisions are simply to start as soon as possible, including smartly building credit, planning for retirement, and paying off debt sooner rather than later.\n\nAlong with students from Nequa Valley High School, Sandwich students are participating in SIFMA's The Stock Market Game™ where they manage a hypothetical $100,000 online portfolio and invest in real stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

123916254317516	ISIL poses a serious and growing threat to Americans and our allies both at home and abroad. This off-shoot of al Qaeda in Iraq is perhaps the most barbaric and bloodthirsty adversary our nation has yet faced. These cold-blooded murderers must be defeated, and I look forward to a thorough and thoughtful debate in Congress over what tools and authority the President needs to do that.	865245756851225
123916254317516	Met with Estonian Ambassador Erik Marmei and parliamentarians from Romania last week in DC. All are concerned about Russia's continued meddling in Ukraine.	864201730288961
186221644739359	I was saddened and angered by the massacre on Garissa University College in Kenya by al-Shabaab, an al-Qaida affiliate, today which has claimed as many as 147 innocent lives. These students lost their lives at the hands of ruthless killers bent on imposing their oppressive ideology on anyone caught in their destructive path.\n\nThese latest violations of human rights and the deliberate targeting of religious minorities—in this case Kenyan Christians—is a brutal and grotesque affront to a cornerstone of American and international values: the right of belief without coercion or reprisal.\n\nFrom the march of al-Qaida affiliates and the Islamic State further into Africa, to the kidnappings and killings of religious minorities in Libya, to today’s atrocities, the larger Middle East region continues to be a hotbed for religious-based persecution which continues to spread.\n\nI have co-sponsored H.Res. 139 which condemns violence against religious minorities in the Middle East, promotes freedom of religious expression throughout the world, and urges the administration to appoint a Special Envoy to Promote Religious Freedom of Religious Minorities in the Middle East. We cannot and must not be silent in the face of any attacks on the freedom of belief.	1025036404191208
186221644739359	One of Congress’ basic duties is to put forth and pass a framework for allocating taxpayer dollars. Today’s budget proposals that focus on American prosperity and building opportunity for everyone provide a stark contrast to President Obama’s plan that never balances and perpetuates Washington’s overzealous spending culture. H. Con. Res. 27 provides the starting point to what I hope will be serious negotiations between Congress and the Administration to get our spending under control, start to pay down our growing national debt, provide for our national defense, and make good on our commitments. \n\nCongress has been clear that a serious budget proposal would respect the simple idea all family budgets adhere to: you can't spend more than you take in. Our prosperity and that of the next generation relies on that principle. These proposals are the first step toward that goal.	1020669011294614
186221644739359	Hundreds of thousands of Americans each year get treatment at the approximately 6,000 Ambulatory Surgery Centers in the United States (~100 in Illinois). Today, the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association and I tackled everything from the "doc fix" to the Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality and Access Act to taxes on medical devices. High-quality care is the hallmark of ASCs, which makes the ASC model a critical part of the modern U.S. health care system.	1011359852225530
186221644739359	Strong partnerships at the local, state and federal levels are key to propelling the priorities of the 14th District. At today's legislative breakfast the Kane County Board, local officials and I discussed key areas in which we've worked together for the benefit of our community (heroin abuse, human trafficking, transportation, fighting hunger, municipal finance) and are looking forward to building on those successes this year.	1010200799008102
186221644739359	Did you know that the most recent supercomputing speed tests are still more than 1,000x slower than the human brain? That’s why the Science and National Labs Caucus, which I co-chair with  Congressman Chaka Fattah, hosted a briefing with IBM on the American Supercomputing Leadership Act to talk about the exciting frontiers in “exascale” computing. Advanced modeling is vital to our national security, medical innovation, and basic scientific research.	1002250019803180
186221644739359	A big thank you to The Center for Bioethics & Human Dignity and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Rosalind Picard for a fantastic briefing on new emerging technologies like the Empatica Embrace wearable wristband which uses sensors to do everything from detecting convulsive seizures which can save lives, to tracking stress, to monitoring one's emotions while riding a roller coaster. \n\nAs we move to embrace these exciting and innovative technologies, it's important at the same time for society and policymakers alike to address important bioethical questions that can arise, like "Who should own or have access to my medical data?" and "What limits if any should we put on the use, tracking and targeting of emotion-related data?" and "What policies should govern the introduction of technologies we haven't even thought about yet?" These and more go hand-in-hand with innovation and discovery.	998872223474293
186221644739359	Dignitaries and Members of Parliament from around the world are in town for the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday.

186221644739359	In recognition of superior valor during World War II, Congress today presented the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award, to the First Special Service Force. A military unit composed of volunteers from the United States and Canada, the Force was activated in July 1942 and was instrumental in counteracting the German war effort. They were just ordinary men – lumberjacks, miners, hunters – whose skills evolved to become one of the most effective units trained in unconventional tactics, hand-to-hand combat, and mountain warfare.  \n\nHere's some quick shots of the mock-ups I took at the ceremony today.	989167971111385
186221644739359	My view from the stage! Amazed at the turnout of Americans who support a culture of life. Remarks made by Congressman Dan Lipinski, Tim Scott, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and Congressman Chris Smith, and many other defenders of life.	981254861902696
186221644739359	What's a day in Congress like for a U.S. Representative? What's going on in Washington that affects high school students? I answered these questions and more at John Pellikan’s government class at Prairie Ridge High School.	954908361204013
186221644739359	A true #ThrowbackThursday:\n\nOctober 3, 1863\n\nBy the President of the United States of America.\n\nA Proclamation.\n\nThe year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God. \n\nIn the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence, have not arrested the plough, the shuttle or the ship; the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom. \n\nNo human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy. It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People. \n\nI do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity and Union.\n\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States to be affixed.\n\nDone at the City of Washington, this Third day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the Unites States the Eighty-eighth.\n\nBy the President: Abraham Lincoln\n\n#tbt	941941485834034
186221644739359	I was again reminded of the strong ties our nation has with Sweden as Senator Johnny Isakson and I hosted members of the Swedish Parliament in Washington.

186221644739359	My thoughts on the Ebola outbreak below:\n\n“There is a tremendous amount of legitimate concern and confusion over the threat of the Ebola virus, and how the United States should respond. I believe that the United States would best protect the public health with a coordinated response that incorporates all critical players such as epidemiologists, border security, and hospitals and health responders in West African nations. The U.S. strategy to combat the spread of this virus must include federal, state and local partners. All options should be on the table, including properly tailored air travel restrictions or establishing specialized regional quarantine and treatment facilities to limit the exposure to the general population. Fighting this outbreak will require a coordinated, multi-faceted effort that involves cooperation from many institutions, organizations and individuals.\n\n“I am encouraged by the brave volunteer health workers and missionary doctors who are willing to help combat and contain this disease at the source. The United States is uniquely well-equipped to fight infectious disease outbreaks at home and abroad, and proper aid should remain available amid any travel restrictions. However, the best treatment is only as good as the training and established treatment protocols in our hospitals. This is a virus that takes deadly advantage of any deviation from established safety protocols. Are the CDC protocols in place for health care providers enough?\n\n“I am paying close attention to the information coming out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s hearing yesterday on ‘Examining the U.S. Public Health Response to the Ebola Outbreak’ which included representatives from the CDC, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other agencies.”\n\nThe House has reliably funded government agencies that oversee virus outbreaks, including the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Last week, the House released up to $750 million to support Operation United Assistance, the mission “to provide medical, logistical and security support” to combat Ebola in West Africa. This January, Congress provided the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) with more funding than the president’s request level from last year, an 8.2 percent total increase in funding. I voted for the FY14 omnibus appropriations bill which contained more than $287 million for the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases program, which is responsible for combating diseases like Ebola.\n\nFor more information on Ebola and how it is spread, visit the Illinois Department of Public Health’s website at: http://www.idph.state.il.us/.	919001964794653
186221644739359	The 14th District boasts some truly innovative manufacturers, from Synergy Flavors in Wauconda to UniCarriers in Marengo. In one day I sampled a new papaya flavor destined for the Brazilian marketplace, test drove a forklift and talked with employees about workforce training. Our manufacturers need smart legislation and regional initiatives to expand and hire.	918472718180911

123916254317516	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized their controversial Waters of the United States (#WOTUS) rule this morning. \n\nThe White House says the only people who have a reason to oppose this disastrous rule are ‘polluters who knowingly threaten our clean water.’ Well they should tell that to the hardworking farmers and struggling small business owners in my district who see right through this EPA power grab; they should tell it to the state and local governments who spoke out against this federal overreach; and they should tell it to their own Small Business Administration who urged EPA and the Corps to withdraw the rule last year.\n\nThis fight is far from over. I’ve cosponsored and voted in support of two bipartisan bills to stop this economically devastating rule, and I will continue to oppose this erosion of Americans’ property rights until the Administration ditches their bad WOTUS rule for good.	915284601847340

123916254317516	President Obama talked a good game tonight about growing our economy and strengthening the middle class. Unfortunately, the measures he proposed would instead grow government and weaken America’s ability to compete in the global economy.

187811174579106	Today, a strong, bipartisan majority of the House came together and passed a permanent fix to a long-standing problem that threatened access to medical care for senior citizens. \n\nThe first real entitlement reform in nearly two decades, this legislation repeals once and for all the fatally flawed Sustainable Growth Rate formula for reimbursing Medicare health care providers, and implements structural reforms that will strengthen Medicare and put the program on a more sound financial footing. \n\nThis historic legislation is a positive step forward for a Congress that for too long has been focused on partisan gimmicks.	1085582141468667

In the letter, Lerner's lawyer, William Taylor, asked Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) to excuse her from appearing at tomorrow's hearing.\n\n"Requiring her to appear at the hearing merely to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege would have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her," Taylor wrote.\n\nIssa has instead issued a subpoena to ensure that Lerner appears at the hearing.

70882853544	Statement from Steven Shearer, Schock chief of staff, on Club for Growth attacks \n\nClub for Growth’s endgame is for Congress to become even more strident and gridlocked. \n\nThey are targeting nine Republicans with conservative voting records, for the sole reason of winning the arms race of what interest group can be furthest to the right.  That helps in fundraising. Few people are going to agree with a Congressman who has cast over 3,000 votes. All conservative AND liberal national organizations rate Aaron Schock as a mainstream conservative—except the Club for Growth and Heritage Action. They are loud, but not an accurate reflection of Congressman Schock’s record. \n\nAmong his recent scores from longtime conservative organizations:\n\nThe National Federation for Independent Business (NFIB), 92%.\nAmericans for Prosperity, 89% lifetime rating.\nThe National Tax Limitation Committee, 87%. \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, 93%.\nNational Association of Manufacturers, 97%.\nAmerican Conservative Union, 81% lifetime rating. \n\nThere are organizations on the far left and right that believe members of Congress should reflexively vote in accordance with their precise vote recommendations and submit to their demands to co-sign letters and other measures. If that should be the case we could install robots instead of having elected representatives. Aaron Schock however, believes he was elected to represent the people of the 18th District, not the board of directors of Club for Growth. He will not cede his responsibility to represent all the people of 18th District to any self-anointed guardian of the economic interests of the district.\n \nThe number one reason Aaron Schock is in public service today instead of using his degree in Finance to pursue business interests is his passionate commitment to economic growth. Economic growth is the only way to sustain a path toward a balanced budget. Growth is the only way the middle class and working poor will be able to prosper. \n\nUnfortunately, many of Club for Growth's rigid policies would damage economic growth. \nIf Congress listened to Club for Growth this past New Years Day, our country would have gone off the fiscal cliff resulting in:\n• Higher marginal income tax rates.\n• Higher capital gains tax rates.\n• Higher interest and dividend tax rates.\n• An alternative minimum tax that would have gouged millions more people\n• a higher death tax\n• Doctors would have been reimbursed far less than the cost of treatment in many instances for treating Medicare patients. \n• The Farm Bill would have expired leaving agriculture in a mess. \n\nWith the sequester kicking in at the same time as the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the payroll tax cut, our economy would have suffered a tremendous blow that would have destroyed hundreds of billions of dollars of private wealth by reducing both equity and home values. Governments would have then racked up even more debt as pension systems' equity values would have been damaged. \n\nOne of the bills Club for Growth faulted Congressman Schock is because he voted for the Paul Ryan budget to put our country on a SUSTAINABLE path to a balanced budget.  They wanted the so called “RSC” budget which would have required immediate cuts to CURRENT Medicare and Social Security benefits. That is not acceptable to the American people and therefore unsustainable. \nAaron Schock has not supported elusive quick fixes for show, which seek to do too much, too fast that risk losing all progress on getting spending under control. \n\nAaron Schock supports far reaching Farm Bill reforms such as ending “direct payments,” but he could not support suddenly gutting most farm programs such as crop insurance. That would not be representing the economic interests of the 18th District, whose number one employer is agriculture. \n\nClub for Growth faults Aaron Schock for supporting federal spending on building roads, bridges and other vital public infrastructure, essential for GROWTH.  Building infrastructure is a legitimate role of government for all but the most extreme ideologues, and Aaron Schock isn’t going to stand by while our roads and bridges crumble, leading to economic decay. \n\nGoing over the fiscal cliff this past New Years Day would have caused massive wealth destruction and radically higher tax bills for everyone, which would have savagely damaged economic growth. \n\nSpending money pointing out nine Republican that are impure in their eyes, rather than working to expand our slim 15 seat majority by winning another 9 seats from Democrats, risks losing that majority. If Nancy Pelosi becomes House Speaker again, federal spending would again explode. That would be catastrophic for economic growth. \n\nCongressman Aaron Schock has strongly supported trade expansion, tax simplification, lower marginal tax rates, lower capital gains taxes, the Paul Ryan budgets, and voted against President Obama's stimulus, Cap and Trade, Cash for Clunkers, Obamacare and other big spending bills. \n\nYou can never be too pure for those who make a buck on rabble rousing to differentiate themselves from other conservative organizations.	10151492963283545
70882853544	Here's my thoughts following Gov. Quinn's State of the State:\n\nGOVERNOR’S SPEECH FAILED TO SHOW LEADERSHIP\nIllinois continues to rank among the worst states for pension funding, business climate and budget deficits\n\n"Each State of the State Address by Governor Quinn has become a precursor to Illinois sliding further in the wrong direction," Congressman Aaron Schock said following Gov. Pat Quinn's address.\n\n"Our state ranks near the bottom in business climate, pension funding, unemployment and taxes, and each year we keep going from bad to worse all the while paying more and more. Today’s State of the State Address by Gov. Quinn lamented the need for solutions, but lacked the leadership and boldness needed to enact those solutions. Illinois cannot and will not move forward until we first address our state’s leadership deficit."	10151450072348545
70882853544	Here is my statement regarding Gov. Quinn's State of the State address today:\n\nGOVERNOR’S SPEECH MUST OUTLINE A PATH FORWARD\n\nCongressman Aaron Schock today called on Governor Pat Quinn to outline a path forward for a state mired in debt, job loss and budget deficit in his State of the State speech.\n\n“Over the past few years, Governor Quinn has asked us to pay more in order to solve Illinois’ problems, yet our problems have only gotten worse.  We are moving backwards,” said Schock.  “The impact of the fiscal mismanagement brought forth by Governor Quinn is being felt in every classroom, hospital room and board room. Funding for vital services are being cut, jobs are leaving, and all the while we are paying even more in taxes.”\n\n“Illinois needs a path forward that creates a healthy, secure economy, protects our most vulnerable, and implements common-sense spending controls so that we are never again in the position we are right now,” Schock continued.\n\nSpecifically, Schock said he looks forward to hearing Governor Quinn’s proposals to:\n\n+Address Illinois’ nearly $9 billion in unpaid bills, which is the primary reason Illinois has the worst budget deficit in the nation.\n+Stabilize and secure Illinois’ public pension system, the worst funded systems in the nation.\n+Improve Illinois’ business climate, which is rated one of the worst in the nation.\n\n“Illinois shouldn’t be last in anything,” Schock concluded.  “It’s time to turn this state around and my hope is that Governor Quinn can provide the leadership and vision Illinois needs right now if we are to have any prayer of moving forward.”	10151449440868545

70882853544	Dear Schock Supporters,\n\nBy now most of you have heard or seen a negative ad on radio or television attacking Aaron Schock by falsely accusing him of voting to raise taxes and spending.\n\nThis blatantly false ad portrays the opposite of Congressman Schock’s strong record, which is founded on the principles of economic growth and deficit reduction.\n\nThe ad is from a previously unheard of out-of-state organization (Jobs & Progress Fund) that does not disclose who is funding it.\n\nThis is all about the possibility of Aaron running for Governor in Illinois next year and that any opponent fears facing him more than any other candidate in an election--in this case, the Republican primary for Governor in March of next year.\n\nOne candidate is Bruce Rauner from Chicago. He is a billionaire financier. He has never been elected to any office. In recent years as he began to position himself to run for Governor as a Republican. Rauner has donated to many Republican candidates. However, Rauner has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats, including hundreds of thousands of dollars to Rich Daley and Rahm Emanuel in their races for mayor of Chicago. Rauner is frequently commented on in media stories as an “advisor” to Rahm Emanuel who has “unchecked access” to the mayor’s office. \n\nOne group that Rauner helped to create and lead gave a single $100,000 contribution to Democrat State Representative Jehan Gordon in 2010. Rauner and his wife have made major donations to: the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), Emily’s List, Senator Dick Durbin, Barack Obama for U.S. Senate, John Kerry for President, Tammy Duckworth for Congress and one of the harshest left-wing members of Congress—Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, among others. \n\nThese anti-Schock TV and radio ads are the OPPOSITE of the truth.\n\nSpecifically, they misrepresent Aaron Schock’s vote. Aaron Schock voted to cut taxes by $3.92 trillion over 10 years AND PERMANENTLY extended the middle-class tax relief that originated under President Bush in 2001.\n\nAs Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform said, Aaron Schock did not violate his pledge not to raise taxes with the vote on the fiscal cliff. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation both officially scored the bill as a $3.9 trillion dollar tax cut. \n\nAdditionally, Congressman Aaron Schock voted against President Obama's Stimulus bill and major spending initiatives. He has very conservative scores for his voting record on issues across-the-board from nearly all major organizations that rank Congressional voting records.\n\nFor these reasons, Congressman Aaron Schock is taking immediate legal action to have the ad pulled because it is absolutely false. Already two stations have responded and pulled the air from their airwaves because it is untrue. \n\nSome of you have contacted us to ask what you can do to support Aaron Schock in the face of these hundreds of thousands of dollars in negative attack ads that are completely untrue. You can let everyone you know the real facts of the matter here and that is part of a scorched Earth strategy by one candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor. Another option, if you so choose, you may make your own views on this more widely known by commenting on blogs about this or writing a letter to the editor of your newspaper. \n\nPlease help us shine a light on motives behind these ads, and the fact that they are 100 percent untrue. Aaron Schock is not above criticism based on fact and actuality. This is a deceitful, invalid and erroneous attack by a newly created out of state organization that operates in the shadows. \n\nThank you for your continued strong support of Congressman Aaron Schock.\n\nSteven Shearer\nChief of Staff\nCongressman Aaron Schock	10151379272303545

These comprehensive and  commonsense reforms clearly define taxpayer rights, terminate IRS employees who target Americans based on their political beliefs, and ensure that taxpayers aren’t taxed on their gifts to tax-exempt organizations. The current system is in disarray and this legislation is a step in the right direction to ensure the IRS works for the American people.	908802002511924

109067049164902	I am very disappointed that President Obama chose to veto the Keystone XL pipeline. \n\nThis project would create thousands of jobs and potentially bring billions of dollars in revenue to our economy. I am hopeful that members of Congress and the American people will keep their voices loud in support of Keystone so that we can one day begin to build it.	825490810855852

109067049164902	My statement on  Senator Dan Coats\n\n “Senator Dan Coats has been one of the finest public servants the Hoosier State has had over the last several decades. From his time in the House of Representatives, throughout his three terms in the Senate, and as the United States Ambassador to Germany, Dan Coats always put the interests of his fellow Americans first. He is someone we can all admire.\n \n“As a fine family man he is full of accomplishments both personally and professionally. I’d like to congratulate him on a wonderful career in public service and I wish the Coats family all the best. He will certainly be missed on Capitol Hill but I look forward to working with him as he completes the rest of his term.”	839721376099462

109067049164902	My statement on ATF's Failed Ammo Ban. \n\n“The President failed to ban the most popular rifle in America in 2013, and now his administration has been stopped from banning that rifle’s ammunition. I am relieved ATF heard the bicameral, bipartisan objections to their dangerously flawed proposal. ATF’s attempt to ban certain shotguns from importation in 2011 relied upon the same unconstitutional ‘sporting purposes’ test that this attempted overreach did, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to change that provision in the future.\n\n“The Constitution forbids infringement on Americans’ right to keep and bear arms, and this arbitrary ban of common ammunition would have been a clear infringement. I continue to hope the president and his administration will be more respectful of Hoosiers’ Constitutional rights in the future.”	832328246838775
109067049164902	I am honored to have been rewarded the "Defender of Economic Freedom Award" from the Club for Growth.

109067049164902	My statement on the 50th Anniversary of the Selma marches. \n\n“Today, we remember a group of courageous Americans who defiantly marched in pursuit of their civil rights. The actions of Selma 50 years ago must remain a continual reminder that racial discrimination should have no role in our future.\n\n"We must never forget the lessons of the Civil Rights Movement. Instead we must use them to stand together and stay united as one nation in our quest to create a more perfect union.”	830746413663625
109067049164902	My full statement on Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech. \n\n“I was very proud to sit and listen to Prime Minister Netanyahu address a joint session of Congress, the American people, and the rest of the world about the dangers of striking a deal with a tyrannical regime in Iran that would allow it to become a nuclear power. According to our own State Department, Iran has been a leading state sponsor of terrorism for decades. We should not be striking a deal for the purpose of simply striking a deal. The goal should be to make sure that one of the world’s most dangerous regimes will never be able to obtain the world’s most dangerous weapons.  \n\n“Israel has always been an ardent supporter of freedom and an unshakable ally to the United States of America. I am hopeful that we can keep our relationship above any political squabbles going forward and that our nations can rely on each other in our mutual quest for a peaceful world for many years to come.”	828835577188042
109067049164902	I was very proud to attend Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech today. America must always stand with one of our strongest allies, the great state of Israel!	828752300529703

109067049164902	We need a clear strategy to defeat ISIS. Today, I went to the House floor and delivered the following remarks. \n\n“Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for one minute and to revise and extend my remarks.\n\nMr. Speaker, over the last several months ISIS has shown just how barbaric they can be. They are willing to kill and torture innocent people in the most savage ways to intimidate the United States and the civilized world. With the recent beheadings in the Middle East, and the multiple shootings in Europe, it is very clear that terrorism is a problem that only continues to grow. \n\n“The Islamic State might be the most well trained, well equipped, and well financed terror group we have ever seen and if an international coalition is not willing to stop them, no one will.\n \n“I have supported President Obama’s use of air strikes since they began several months ago to push back on the gains made by the Islamic State, and I still strongly believe that we should continue these strikes with our Arab partners. Throughout our history, we have shown that we can overcome any obstacle and defeat any enemy if we are willing to stand up to it. \n\n“However, I have so far been disappointed that the president has asked for an Authorization of Military Force (AUMF) without articulating a clear strategy on how to ultimately defeat ISIS.\n\n“If President Obama would present such a plan, I believe both Republicans and Democrats, in both chambers would stand with him and show the world that we are united in confronting this dangerous enemy. I am hopeful the president takes this opportunity to lead, and unite the American people towards defeating our latest adversary in the war terror. \n\n“Thank you. I yield back.”	825912064147060

123884330964019	Today, another video depicting the violence and brutality taking place by the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was released on social media.  While it is too early to confirm if the video is genuine, or if the footage portrays Abdul-Rahman Kassig, my prayers remain with the Kassig family and all those still suffering under the violence in the Middle East.	868888726463572

123884330964019	Happy Labor Day! Today, as we celebrate American workers who have done so much to make our country strong and prosperous, may we also renew our commitment to build a better future for all working families.	828069813878797
123884330964019	Congressman André Carson released the following statement in response to today's funeral for Michael Brown:\n\n"Today, as we honor the life of Michael Brown, we must also think about ways to prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again. Like many Americans, I am saddened and frustrated by a criminal justice system that too often fails people of color. \n\n"It is my hope that in the wake of this life cut too short, our country can address the injustices that continue to exist in our communities today. I am committed to working with my colleagues to find common sense solutions to ensure a more tolerant and just society."	824496810902764
123884330964019	This week, I had the opportunity to meet some hard working Hoosiers during my tour of Carrier Cooperation. Did you know they manufacture nearly 1/3 of the furnaces used in North America?	817065008312611
135670516492974	Some people have asked whether or not immigration language could make its way into a potential trade agreement negotiated by President Obama. My colleague and leader in the fight against President Obama's illegal amnesty, Steve King, worked to get language in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to make certain immigration stays out of the negotiation of trade agreements. This is yet another reason why we need TPA, to limit what the President can do while negotiating a trade deal. \n\nAs Congressman King put it: "My language tells the executive branch that they cannot negotiate changes in our immigration laws or use visa programs as a negotiating tool. Further, my language keeps immigration out of all future trade agreements negotiated under TPA. I am confident this has improved TPA and it gets me to a yes on the final bill.”\n\nHere is how the language reads: "To ensure that trade agreements do not require changes to the immigration laws of the United States or obligate the United States to grant access or expand access to visas issued under 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)."\n\nAgain, TPA is not a trade agreement, it is legislation that puts limits on the President, makes sure the public can view any deal negotiated by the President for 60 days prior to it coming to Congress, and ultimately gives Congress a veto over a bad deal. \n\nYou can find more info here: https://steveking.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/king-reaches-agreement-with-ryan-on-tpa.	895962357130449

The dedicate commands at Crane continue to lead the nation in providing cutting edge technology to the warfighter that is integral to the security of our people at home and abroad. \n\nThanks to Rep. Todd Young for cohosting the event with me and for everyone who made the event a success.	873427872717231
135670516492974	Yesterday, I had the distinct honor to help honor a Hoosier veteran who received the prestigious Soldier’s Medal, which is the highest medal awarded to enlisted Army personnel for non-combat related acts of valor.  We were joined by Indiana Guardsman Maj. Gen. R. Martin Umbarger and the ceremony was held at the 181st Intelligence Wing in Terre Haute. \n                                                               \nFormer Army Specialist 4th Class John Sutton of Worthington, Indiana was awarded the Soldier’s Medal for his acts of bravery and heroism while saving the life of a fellow soldier after their helicopter crashed in Vietnam. John joins the ranks of only 200 Americans who have received this award since Vietnam. \n\nI’m incredibly honored to have helped John obtain this award and proud of his service to our country.	872143389512346
135670516492974	Proud to have been a part of the biggest entitlement reform in nearly two decades that helps save taxpayer dollars, improve access to care for seniors, and ensure the Medicare promise is around for future generations.	868969416496410
135670516492974	I was honored to attend Speaker John Boehner's signing ceremony today for H.R. 2, a bill that includes the first real entitlement reform in nearly two decades. This unprecedented legislation improves the quality of care for our nation's seniors and helps protect the Medicare promise for future generations.

Crane Army is a tremendous asset to the Eighth Congressional District, and our nation's security. As one of the nation's foremost munitions facilities, Crane Army Ammunition Activity is essential to the mission of the Department of Defense and critical for our nation's security. It's important that we take opportunities to tell their story and showcase that Crane is leading the nation in innovation. Thank you Secretary Hammack for taking the time to visit.	823167817743237

135670516492974	We also passed H.R. 33, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act of 2014, tonight. \n\nH.R. 33 makes sure that volunteer hours worked by qualified emergency service volunteers are not counted by the IRS as full-time or full-time equivalent worker under ObamaCare's employer mandate. This bill offers certainty and stability to volunteer fire departments by explicitly exempting them from the employer mandate.	817590488300970

135670516492974	In Princeton this morning to tour the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Plant. I always enjoy walking through the TMMI Visitors Center!	768650763194943
135670516492974	On Friday the President is scheduled to visit Gibson County.  Like many Hoosiers, I look forward to hearing the President address the many concerns we have regarding the future of the manufacturing and energy sectors that are critical to our state. I’m hopeful he will address the proposed EPA regulations that will devastate our coal industry, hamper our manufacturers, and increase energy costs on all Hoosiers. \n\nI’ll be on Eyewitness News Local WEHT WTVW with Brad Byrd tonight at 9pm CT to discuss what to expect.	759772077416145
135670516492974	Good perspective showing another reason why the EPA's new regulations are ideological, not good policy. http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/barbara-hollingsworth/upcoming-anniversary-october-1st-will-mark-18-years-no-global	757058347687518

135670516492974	I joined my colleagues in the House to pass H.Res. 644 condemning the Obama Administration for releasing five senior Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay without properly notifying Congress. This action was a direct violation of the National Defense Authorization Act (signed by President Obama), which requires the Secretary of Defense to notify Congress 30 days before transferring or releasing Guantanamo Bay detainees.  The United States does not negotiate with terrorists, plain and simple.  President Obama’s unilateral action puts our national security at risk, harms the confidence in this Administration’s ability to faithful adhere to constitutional checks and balances, and demonstrates the President’s contempt for the voice of the American people.	749344455125574

186203844738421	A great illustration of how expanded trade will help Indiana’s economy: \n\nIndiana’s advanced manufacturing industry has shown tremendous growth and leadership in global technological and process development. At the forefront of this industry is Cummins, one of the state’s biggest employers and the country’s leading diesel-engine manufacturer. Cummins has continued to push the envelope in research and development and utilized this approach to develop into one of America’s premier manufacturing companies.\n\nThe company’s effect on Columbus, Indiana, where it employs 17% of the local workforce, is tremendous. The unemployment rate registers at an impressive 4.7% and Columbus has developed into a thriving 21st century town.\n\nCummins’ growth has been partly driven by its commitment to its employees and global expansion. By being able to access more overseas consumers and markets, revenue and profits have jumped during what we can best describe as a sluggish global economic recovery. One of my primary responsibilities is to ensure that companies like Cummins have fair regulatory conditions and access to foreign markets. I look forward to helping on issues such as these moving forward.\n\nhttp://fortune.com/2015/06/08/cummins-diesel-engine/?utm_content=buffer8d6a3&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer	1139789726046490

186203844738421	This week, the House will continue to move through the appropriations process by considering two bills that fund agencies related to transportation, housing, justice and science. In addition, the House may consider legislation related to the intelligence gathering provisions currently under consideration in the Senate. Finally, the House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on Wednesday to analyze waste, fraud, and abuse in the supplemental security income (SSI) and unemployment insurance (UI) programs.	1133774173314712
186203844738421	We've had a lot of Hoosiers and 9th District resident's in the office this week.  We had a group of Century 21 agents from Johnson County, a delegation from the Indiana American Legion, and the Indiana State Alliance of YMCA's (which included a Bloomington resident).  If you're in the nation's capital, please stop by your Congressional office and say hello!	1067114896647307
186203844738421	At midnight, several intelligence gathering provisions that have been crucial to preventing another 9/11-type attack expired. Though couched in the language of protecting civil liberties, they expired because some Senators would rather recklessly seek political gain than to act responsibly to keep our country safe. The fact of the matter is the bill passed overwhelmingly by the House weeks ago addresses the civil liberty concerns—concerns I share—in a manner that still allows for the collection of vital intelligence.\n \nIronically, it is always in the moments immediately following a national security event that the civil liberties of the American people are most at risk. Should the unthinkable happen during this lapse in authorization, I suspect we’ll find the supposed choice between security or liberty to be a false dichotomy. The House-passed USA Freedom Act is proof that such interests can be balanced, and I urge responsible legislators to quickly work to pass it through the Senate.	1133701103322019
186203844738421	For the past sixty-four years, the American people have united in a nationwide day of prayer. The National Day of Prayer highlights the near impossible odds America has overcome throughout her history to become the most exceptional country in the history of the world. Some of our nation’s greatest leaders, such as President Abraham Lincoln and President Dwight Eisenhower, have led the nation in prayer during times of strife. The principle of religious freedom is one of the founding principles of the United States. It is important we recognize and embrace our freedoms as we move forward. I invite Hoosiers to join in celebrating America’s National Day of Prayer.	1116096275082502
186203844738421	Today, the 9th district office is proud to announce the artists who will be receiving awards for their entries into the 2015 Congressional Art Competition. Congratulations to Anna McCoy of Bloomington High School North, Katherine McCadden of New Albany High School, Rachel Geveden of New Albany High School, and Kayla Foster of New Albany High School for their winning entries. Anna’s work—Precious—will hang in the United States Capitol and will be seen by hundreds of thousands of people over the course of the next year. In addition, Kayla Foster’s work—Horn’s Abound—received the most ‘likes’ on Facebook and will hang in the 9th District office in Washington D.C. for a year.  This year’s contest was full of talented artists who should be proud of their work. For more information on the contest and the winning entries, please refer to the 9th district website. \n\nhttp://toddyoung.house.gov/press-releases/rep-todd-young-announces-winners-in-2015-congressional-art-competition/	1113141302044666

186203844738421	As one of the co-chairs of the Congressional Soccer Caucus, last night I was excited to play in the 3rd Annual Congressional Soccer Classic to raise money for charity. The Republicans beat the Democrats 8-4, but to be honest we had a little help from former U.S. Men's National Team star Cobi Jones.	1101968479828615
186203844738421	I was honored to receive recognition from the National Association of Manufacturers. Manufacturing is a crucial cog of the economic machine in Indiana and I look forward to working more in the future on issues important to Hoosiers.	1097783823580414

186203844738421	Yesterday, I visited The Warehouse Ministry and had a productive discussion with Hutton Honors College students in Bloomington.	1097699426922187
186203844738421	Yesterday, I spent the morning in Bloomington. Check out some pictures from visits to Arlington Heights Elementary, Oliver Winery, and the Bloomington Social Security office.	1096365110388952
186203844738421	In observance of Good Friday, the 9th district offices will be closed. The offices will reopen on Monday, April 6th.	1093249784033818
186203844738421	March is one of the busiest months to see constituents in Washington. It's good to see friendly, Hoosier faces in our nation's capital.  If you're coming out for spring break, or business, or just for fun, make sure to stop by Longworth 1007 and say hello!	1088930577799072
186203844738421	Toured SAIC in Bedford today. It's a great business that helps support military efforts over at Crane and beyond.	1083641151661348
186203844738421	Happy 200th Birthday to the town of Orleans! A year older than the state of Indiana, it was named in honor of the U.S. victory at the Battle of New Orleans which had concluded a month prior. \n\nFun fact: The Battle of New Orleans is the only time U.S. Marine and British Marines have faced off in battle, which makes the town all the more special to this Marine.	1077914122234051
186203844738421	Busy day around the district yesterday.  Started out at Paoli Inc. to take part in the presentation of their OSHA Voluntary Protection Program award for going above and beyond in keeping their employees safe. Then I headed to Orleans to celebrate the town's 200th birthday (that's right, it's older than the state itself!). Next I drove up to Martinsville to visit the Candy Kitchen and present them with our 9th District Small Business Spotlight award (make sure to stop in and buy some treats if you're in the area). Finished off the day attending the Indiana Chamber of Commerce's Legislative Dinner.	1077888548903275
186203844738421	Due to the winter storm, our Jeffersonville Constituent Service Center is closed, and our Washington DC office will be closing earlier. If you need assistance today, please contact our Bloomington Constituent Service Center at 812-336-3000.	1072266169465513
186203844738421	As Congress has debated Homeland Security funding the past few weeks, it’s become apparent that we’ve let two very distinct issues become too entwined.  \n \nOn the issue of President Obama’s executive actions on immigration, I have repeatedly said that he lacks the authority to act unilaterally—a point he made himself on 22 separate occasions, and many Democrats have made.  Every time the House had an opportunity to block or defund those actions, I voted to do so. I’m encouraged that the courts are currently halting those actions as illegal.\n \nFunding for Homeland Security, however, is a different issue.  Senate Democrats have filibustered our attempt to simultaneously fund DHS and block their authority to enforce the President’s actions.  In doing so, they’ve made it clear that they are willing to let partisan politics get in the way of substantive policy debate. I am not willing to do the same—especially not at the risk of shutting down the agency charged with keeping Americans safe.\n \nI spent ten years of my life in the military because I thought our country was worth serving and defending.  I still feel the same as a U.S. Representative.  That’s why today, I voted to keep our citizens safe by keeping Homeland Security funded, rather than voting to make a political point about a distinctly different issue.	1071205766238220
22137505280	I am looking forward to working with Congresswoman-elect Hochul!!!	10150278680145281
186203844738421	Spent this morning at several Bloomington businesses before meeting with constituents at our Bloomington Constituent Service Center in the afternoon.

186203844738421	On Saturday morning, and in the midst of a snow storm, I drove to Martinsville for breakfast to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima with the Marine Corps League of Morgan County. Today is the 70th Anniversary of the iconic photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on top of Mount Suribachi.  Semper Fi to all my fellow Marines in Martinsville and beyond.	1065876760104454

186203844738421	Some pictures from the new businesses we visited in Seymour yesterday: Bite the Bullet, a new gun shop (I'm told this time of year is known as "gun month" here because business picks up as people get tax refund checks); Java Joint, a great little coffee shop (pictured with their Seymour's Sin blend); and Beautiful Choas, a retail shop that just opened last week selling reclaimed and refurbished signs, furniture, and more.	1062847313740732
186203844738421	Busy afternoon yesterday in Corydon.  Met with some local constituents who had asked for meetings, held an open forum with veterans, and visited Gun World to talk to the owners (and I tried shooting one of their bows while I was there).	1061901550501975
178887452188843	Veterans Day is a special opportunity for us to honor the sacrifice and service made by current and former U.S. Military. Its origins go back to the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of the "War to End All Wars," which began 100 years ago in Europe. \n\nMy father was a World War II combat veteran who posted the colors four days each year: Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day and Veterans Day. I follow that same tradition to honor his memory. \n\nToday, please join me in telling a veteran, "Thank you for my freedom."	715376475206602
178887452188843	As Iowa farmers begin one of the largest harvests in history, it’s important to remind all Iowans that this is Farm Safety and Health Week. As farmers, truck drivers and workers at grain elevators and biofuel refineries spend long hours on the job, we all need to think about what we can do to help keep them safe. From being alert to slow moving vehicles to reminding each other of basic safety rules working with farm implements, every Iowans can make a difference. \n\nPlease take the time to thank an Iowa farmer and do everything possible to keep hardworking Iowans safe.	690649431012640
178887452188843	It is clear that the breadth and scope of the unconscionable acts of terror visited upon the United States thirteen years ago remain impossible to measure. The effect is most profound on those who lost loved ones that day -- or those who subsequently lost a loved ones during our military missions to combat terrorist threats across the globe -- and my thoughts and prayers are with all of them today.	684194304991486
178887452188843	Labor Day has always been a time to gather with family and friends and enjoy the traditional end of summer. But the real purpose of Labor Day is to celebrate American workers, who have been responsible for the most innovative and powerful economy in the world.  Better and safer working conditions exist because American workers fought for them. American workers deserve jobs that pay a living wage for a hard day's work. On this Labor Day, my thoughts are with the hardworking Americans who make our lives better and help make America the greatest country in the world.	678960102181573
178887452188843	While the fourth of July is celebrated with family, friends and fireworks, it’s ultimately a celebration of what America has represented for over two centuries -- freedom, opportunity, and self-determination. \n\nIndependence Day is an opportunity to celebrate those American ideals and to honor the generations of Americans that have sacrificed to provide them. I’m proud to join all Iowans as we celebrate America’s founding and the ideals it has represented for centuries.	649243215153262
178887452188843	I’m blessed to be spending part of my holiday weekend with my family and I hope many Iowans are able to do the same. But no matter what we’re all doing, each of us is exercising the freedoms that generations of America’s veterans have fought to provide us. I know all Iowans will join me in remembering those heroes who have given their lives in the past year -- and all veterans who have served throughout America’s history.	630101473734103
178887452188843	It’s hard to believe that twelve years have passed since the terrible events of September 11, 2001. Today, I think about the Iowans who lost their lives that day, including Tim Haviland, whose family is from Ames; Michael Tinley, a Council Bluffs native; and Karen Kincaid-Batacan, a native of Waverly.\n\nWe must always remember the bravery and sacrifice of those who died and those who had their lives forever changed that day. We must never stop honoring their memory by striving to make our nation better and stronger, not in spite of our differences, but because of them.	511784218899163
178887452188843	After watching the President’s address tonight, I’m still unconvinced that a limited US military strike is the appropriate response to the atrocities committed in Syria. \n\nI believe the international community needs to be more directly involved in holding Syria’s dictator responsible for breaking international law, and I’ll watch closely in the coming days to see how these efforts at diplomacy develop.	511539085590343
178887452188843	Today, we honor the hard-working men and women who have built our country into a land of opportunity and promise. We pause to reflect on the sacrifices so many have made to make a better life for their children and the generations to come. And we recognize the struggles ahead to ensure that our nation remains a place where everyone has a chance to realize the American dream if they work hard for it.	508151642595754
178887452188843	The President is making the right decision to seek Congressional authorization before taking any military action in Syria. \n\nIn the coming days, I will carefully review the case for military action in Syria. Before putting American lives at risk and spending millions of taxpayer dollars, we must be confident that any American involvement in Syria serves our national security interests first and avoids getting the United States involved in an open-ended military commitment.	507389139338671
178887452188843	There's absolutely no place for politics at the IRS, and the resignation of the IRS acting director is a good first step at holding accountable the people responsible for their shameful actions.	463076297103289
178887452188843	My thoughts and prayers are with Sgt. Steve Blass’ family during this difficult time. I’m thankful for Sgt. Blass’ service to our country and willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedoms. I hope all Iowans will keep the Blass family in their prayers.	441056592638593
178887452188843	This is an historic moment for the Catholic Church. It’s an exciting and hopeful time for Catholics in Iowa and around the world. I wish Pope Francis I the best as he begins his service.	439372692806983
178887452188843	I'm proud that the House just voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and send it to the President's desk. This type of violence is far too common, but this bill will help break the cycle of violence against women and provide victims the care they need.	433933406684245
178887452188843	Today the FAA announced that the Waterloo, Dubuque, and Sioux City airport control towers could be closed due to the arbitrary, across the board spending cuts, known as the "sequester." This is exactly the reason why I voted against this irresponsible legislation and why I urge Congress to get its act together to avoid these dangerous cuts.	431387963605456
178887452188843	I’m glad to hear President Obama refocus on the economy tonight.  Congress and the President cannot lose focus on the struggles of the middle class in our country.	427536550657264
178887452188843	I’m outraged by the International Olympic Committee’s decision to drop wrestling from the Olympic Games.  Wrestling is one of the oldest Olympic sports, and Iowans are proud of our state’s long tradition of wrestling excellence – from Frank Gotch to Dan Gable to Cael Sanderson – and the IOC’s decision deals a major blow to the sport itself.	427365337341052
178887452188843	A big congratulations to former Cyclone Kelechi Osemele & former Hawkeye Marshal Yanda on their Super Bowl win last night!	424027844341468
178887452188843	My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of Ambassador Stevens and the other Americans who lost their lives yesterday. This is an absolute travesty, and a direct attack on Americans. I firmly believe that we should do everything possible to bring those responsible to justice.	364041310340122
178887452188843	Just voted yes on the Audit the Fed bill. It passed the House with bipartisan support, 327-98.	347738548637065
178887452188843	My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families of the horrific theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado.	346040752140178

291731316748	Today we pause to honor the men and women who served our nation in order to protect and defend the freedoms we cherish. But we must remember that one day is not enough. We must work everyday as a nation to ensure those who served come home to good jobs, have access to health care and their families get the support they need. To all who have served, or are currently serving, thank you. #VeteransDay	10152684907226749

291731316748	This afternoon Dave attended briefings in Davenport with local officials and business owners to discuss flood preparations. After these meetings, Dave, Davenport Mayor Bill Gluba and Alderman Rick Dunn went to Credit Island Bait Shop to help fill sand bags to protect their store.	10152405015481749
291731316748	Over the weekend, Dave attended the Quad Cities Military Salute Gala, which is hosted by the QC Chamber and AUSA. During the event, Emmett Keenan, a D-Day veteran, cut the cake along with other senior military leaders. Dave also signed the Community Covenant, which is a document designed to be a pillar of support for the regions Defense sector and our Military and their families.	10152371040691749
291731316748	I was tremendously proud to welcome the Eastern Iowa Honor Flight and Iowa’s veterans of the Second World War and the Korean and Vietnam Wars to our nation’s capital today. The Honor Flight offers these veterans the opportunity to come to Washington to see the memorials built in their honor. Thanks to all of the volunteers, Quaker Oats and the Eastern Iowa Honor Flight for organizing and sponsoring this trip of a lifetime!	10152318127421749
291731316748	Last night, Dave greeted members of the Quad Cities Honor Flight as they returned from their trip to Washington, D.C. The Honor Flight of the Quad Cities brings both World War II and Korean War veterans to Washington to visit our nation’s capital and Memorials built in their honor.	10152248210246749
291731316748	Today we pause to honor the service of generations of veterans and reflect on the sacrifices they and their families have made for our great country. \n\nTo our men and women in uniform and to our veterans - thank you for your service to our great nation. #VeteransDay	10151939172951749
291731316748	BREAKING NEWS: The International Olympic Committee just voted to reinstate wrestling as a core sport. It is a great day for those who fought so hard to get it back in the Olympics! #SavedOlympicWrestling	10151801966131749
291731316748	Happy 4th of July! Hope you take some time to be with family and friends today. Also, take a moment to thank a Veteran for the freedoms they have given us.	10151671727286749
291731316748	Statement from Dave on the capture of the bombing suspect tonight in Boston:\n\n“I am relieved that the tragic events, which have terrorized Boston and the nation over the past five days, seem to have come to an end this evening.  The work of the first responders, law enforcement officials and the National Guard has been truly heroic. Now that the suspect has been captured, he must face the full force of our judicial system.”	10151547223921749
291731316748	Tomorrow Dave will be joining Rock Island Arsenal employees in Davenport to announce that he's donating a part of his salary to charity to reflect sequester cuts.\n\nAbout his decision Dave said, ““From workers at the Rock Island Arsenal, to children in Head Start programs, Iowans are starting to feel the impact of the senseless and indiscriminate cuts that sequester has caused.  It makes no sense to me that the only people that are not feeling any pain from sequester are members of Congress themselves.”	10151536092176749
291731316748	Dave had a great tour yesterday at Isabel Bloom in Davenport.\n\nhttp://www.kljb.com/story/20548976/congressman-loebsack-paying-a-visit-to-area-businesses	10151351614411749

291731316748	I join all Americans in remembering the victims of the horrific attacks that occurred 11 years ago today.

134325379926458	Happy Constitution Day! \n\nOn September 17, 1787, the Constitution was signed by 39 brave men who changed the course of our history. This document both established the framework of American government and secured the basic, God-given rights that Americans enjoy today. I believe that God moved our Founding Fathers around like men on a chess board with divine guidance to craft this document. Today, we are seeing time and again how the Constitution is being pushed aside and overlooked when determining the course of America. I have placed my hand on the Bible and pledged my oath to defend and uphold the Constitution since first elected into office and I take this responsibility very seriously. I challenge all Americans to read the Constitution and reflect on the core values and pillars of American exceptionalism woven into it: that of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and the sovereign expression of ‘We the People.’ As we celebrate today, may we never forget that the values upheld in the Constitution are what make our Nation that ‘Shining City on a Hill’.	951255494900105

6974973662	Honored to attend the National Hunger Seder, which brings together a diverse range of independent communities who can, together, make a difference in the fight to end child hunger.

6974973662	Today I had the opportunity to speak about 529 college savings plans to the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST).

6974973662	In November, Americans sent a clear message to Washington that they were tired of political gridlock and want solutions and real results to the problems facing our country. Both President Bush and President Clinton used their State of the Union address following difficult midterm elections to acknowledge that they no longer have control of both chambers and that it was time for them to work with Congress. Unfortunately, tonight was another missed opportunity for President Obama and his legacy. \n \nPresident Obama used this evening to appease his political base and focused on dividing our Nation and using bureaucratic control to run our country with top-down Washington-centered solutions. I believe the key to growing a healthy economy begins by strengthening the paycheck of hard working Americans, putting more money into Kansans pockets, and growing our economy from the bottom-up.  \n \nWhile I was disappointed in many of the President's remarks, I remain hopeful there will be opportunities in the near future to work together to expand trade and fix our broken tax code. I remain hopeful that this President will seize those opportunities just as those who preceded him did.	10152609560173663
6974973662	Today I joined Congressional leaders at the White House to meet with President Obama and Vice President Biden. \n\nI believe there was a consensus to find solutions to stop the ever-emerging cyber-attacks, while still protecting your privacy. Increasing cyber-security must be a high priority and the House stands ready to work with the President to help keep our homeland safe. We also discussed the need to update the Authorization for the Use of Military Force in order to destroy and eliminate ISIL. \n \nWe also continued to urge the President to work with Congress – instead of threatening to veto bipartisan legislation – and act on the recent House-passed bills to get folks back to work. There will be opportunities to expand trade and fix our broken tax code in the near future and after today’s meeting I hope these will be issues we can work together on and find sensible solutions to grow our economy.	10152595636728663
6974973662	It was an honor to attend the dedication of the Topeka Habitat for Humanity home to the Munganga Family! Earlier this year I had the privilege of volunteering to help build their home and it was a truly rewarding experience. I can't think of anyone more deserving than Bora Munganga and his wife, and I wish them all the best in the future.	10152497872093663
6974973662	Today the House responded to the President’s overreaching executive orders by passing the Executive Amnesty Prevention Act of 2014. This election the American people sent a clear message to Washington expressing they want us to work together to deliver real results that solve the problems facing folks all across the country. President Obama’s unilateral action blatantly disregards this message and the separation of powers set forth by the Constitution. The President knows he is not authorized to take action and the American people deserve an honest debate about this important issue.\n\nIt’s important we do immigration reform the right way, with a step by step approach. It starts with enforcement.  The House chose to act and passed bipartisan legislation in August to provide an immediate and targeted response to strengthen and secure our border. The president and the Senate chose not to take up this bill.\n \nThen we need to work on reforms to the legal immigration system to treat those who want to come here legally fairly.	10152489964823663
6974973662	Thank you to everyone who came to Senator Moran and my joint Kansas to Congress meeting in Topeka today! We discussed a number of important issues including immigration reform, the president's healthcare law, and mental health. My first priority has always been to listen to Kansans and to take your advice and ideas to Washington each and every week.	10152472419923663
154026694650252	This week I had the privilege to sit down with members of the Jewish Community Relations Bureau/American Jewish Committee in Overland Park. I appreciated the opportunity to hear from the group on many issues, from foreign policy to trade. Thank you for your leadership in our community.	936673409718906
154026694650252	Today marks the beginning of a new chapter for Kansas and for America, as the Department of Homeland Security  broke ground on its foremost animal disease research facility in Manhattan, Kansas. The  National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, or NBAF, is a joint state and federal project I have been proud to fight for in my role on the House Appropriations Committee. NBAF will be replacing Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York by 2023, making Kansas the front line for America's food security. \n\nNBAF coming to Kansas also means an economic boon for the state and region. The facility will employ 350 full-time workers and is expected to bring in an additional 40 businesses and labs to the state, to a tune of $3.5 billion in economic activity over 20 years. This will boost an already robust animal health corridor that runs through the Kansas City metro area in the Third District. \n\nToday showed the Kansas prairie spirit is alive and well. Like our pioneer ancestors before us, Kansans will continue to lead America into the future. I was honored to join other federal and state officials to participate in today's groundbreaking and I look forward to returning for the ribbon cutting.	936271503092430
154026694650252	Moments ago, the House of Representatives passed the Pain Capable Unborn Child Act by a vote of 242-184, with my support.\n\nSubstantial medical evidence has shown that unborn children are capable of feeling pain five months into a pregnancy. Additionally, a recent study showed that nearly one-fourth of infants born at five months survive after they are given medical treatment. Sadly, many children at the same stage of development or later are not allowed a chance at a full life. The Pain Capable Unborn Child Act puts a stop to this barbaric practice – not unlike what was uncovered at Dr. Kermit Gosnell’s clinic in Philadelphia two years ago.  \n\nPassing this bill is not only the right thing to do, but it is also supported by a significant majority of the American people. As of 2013, 64% of Americans indicated support for this particular bill and 80% of Americans indicated opposition to third-trimester abortions.  \n\nAs the 114th Congress continues, I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect the sanctity of life wherever possible.	929462460440001
154026694650252	Town Hall Forum starts in 45 minutes at Tomahawk Ridge Community Center in Overland Park. Hope to see you there.	906664366053144
154026694650252	Today, I voted against the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act, which reauthorizes federal funding to subsidize the Amtrak rail system. Amtrak is a corporation whose stock is almost entirely owned by the federal government, and the current system provides no incentive for Amtrak to improve its performance because it knows that every year it will receive a taxpayer bailout for its losses.  This year alone, Amtrak is projected to run an operating loss of $289.6 million. It is yet another example of government picking winners and losers, which I cannot support.	891554090897505
91115765425	Congratulations to the Union County Airport Board in Sturgis on receiving a federal grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation in the amount of $115,200.00 for planning of the airport's future development.	10152718138395426
154026694650252	This was a special week for our community and the members of The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood. Following services I was honored to join Rev. Adam Hamilton in the groundbreaking ceremony for a new permanent sanctuary at the main campus. \n \nAs members of the congregation, my family and I look forward to worshipping in the new hall upon its completion.	890553244330923
154026694650252	Today I held a Housing and Urban Development (HUD) roundtable at Community Housing of Wyandotte County (CHWC) in Kansas City, KS. As a new member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Subcommittee on Appropriations, I appreciated the chance to listen and learn from local governments and nonprofit organizations that administer HUD programs here in the Third District and discuss the impact they have in our communities. Thank you to Donny Smith at CHWC for hosting the discussion.	884461331606781
154026694650252	It was a privilege join Senator Pat Roberts and cohosts BNSF Railway and Dairy Farmers of America in welcoming Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to Kansas today to discuss the important trade issues facing the US Congress. \n\nOne of the points of focus during the discussion was the stalled negotiations between the ports and dockworkers' union bringing cargo to a standstill at our west coast ports. The delay has already cost meat exporters more than $40 million per week, with reports indicating a strike could cost the US economy about $2 billion per day.\n\nI have joined 83 of my colleagues in writing a letter to both parties in the negotiations to resolve this dispute in a timely manner. Additionally, I have cosponsored H Res 108, which calls on President Obama to invoke executive authority under the Taft-Hartley Act on grounds of national interest if the conflict cannot be resolved. \n\nKansas farmers and ranchers need this issue resolved, and I will continue to monitor it closely.	883487835037464
154026694650252	I was honored to work with Johnson County Community College this morning to host a Veterans Suicide Prevention Roundtable Discussion.\n\nThis was an excellent opportunity; bringing together veterans, Veterans Administration staff, college counselors, and non-profit mental healthcare providers to discuss the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act.\n\nThe new law, signed by the President on February 12, 2015, is critical to our efforts to help reduce military and veteran suicides and improve access to quality mental healthcare.\n\nI also toured the new Student Veterans and Military Resource Center at JCCC. The resource center is co-located with the offices of Vet Success on campus. It is staffed by a full-time VA employee who provides information on G.I. Bill eligibility, benefits and other resources.\n\nI want to thank everyone at JCCC including President Dr. Joe Sopcich who welcomed us, and all who took the time to take part in this important discussion.	883412311711683
154026694650252	Happy Kansas Day! \n\nOn this day 154 years ago, Kansas became the 34th state admitted to the Union. In April of 1860, the House of Representatives passed HR 23, admitting Kansas as a free state. The bill stalled in the Senate for several months because of the opposition from slave-state Senators. However, as those states seceded from the Union and those Senators vacated their seats, the Senate was finally able to pass the bill in January of 1861. \n\nI was glad to spend this morning back at my old stomping grounds at the Kansas State Capitol in Topeka. I was testifying on behalf of the Kansas ABLE Act, which would outlines the structure and maintenance of ABLE savings accounts in Kansas. These accounts will benefit many Americans like Rachel Mast, who also did an amazing job testifying before the committee. I hope Kansas, led by Rep. Erin Davis in the legislature, will become the first state in the nation to set up these accounts.	872792122773702
154026694650252	This week, I joined on as an original cosponsor of two important pieces of legislation that reflect my belief in the sanctity of life, and my commitment to promoting the protection of life wherever possible.\n\nThe Pain Capable Unborn Child Act, HR 36, prohibits an abortion of an unborn child past 20 weeks after fertilization. Medical evidence has shown that post-20 weeks, a child is capable of feeling pain. This is not only the right thing to do, but it is also supported by most of America, with 80% of respondents telling Gallup in 2013 they are against third-trimester abortions. \n\nThe Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act, HR 217, preserves taxpayer dollars and protects life by prohibiting Title X family planning grants from being used by organizations that provide abortions. These grants, even before Roe v. Wade, were never supposed to be used in programs where abortions are used as a family planning method. However, organizations like Planned Parenthood continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize their abortions. \n\nIt is my hope that with the new Republican Senate, these bills will be quickly passed and sent to the President’s desk for approval.	861339303918984
154026694650252	My staff and I enjoyed our time serving others at the Salvation Army's KCK Citadel & Harbor Light Village today. This week I'm especially thankful for all our local service organizations who help our friends and neighbors most in need.	834510183268563
154026694650252	It was a privilege to meet and visit with so many 7th graders today at Indian Hills Middle School in Prairie Village. We discussed the three branches of government, how laws are made, and current issues facing our country. These are well-informed students, and I want to thank Social Studies Teacher Judith Schieszer for the invitation and Dr. Scott Sherman, Principal, for his leadership.	833912613328320
154026694650252	This morning I had the privilege to meet employees and recognize safe drivers at UPS in Lenexa. This UPS facility in Lenexa has more than 3000 employees during this peak Holiday season.

154026694650252	This week I joined with my House colleagues in sending a letter to President Obama urging decisive action to protect our citizens from a potential domestic outbreak of Ebola. Ebola poses a clear threat to our citizens, and I believe our government must take aggressive action to combat and prevent its spread in the United States. I urge President Obama to direct his administration to institute travel restrictions from regions that are experiencing the epidemic, as well as implement enhanced airport screening and possible quarantine of individuals who have traveled to, or from, the regions that have been most impacted by this epidemic. Here is the link to the letter: http://yoder.house.gov/sites/yoder.house.gov/files/documents/Ltr%20to%20Pres%20Obama%20Ebola%20Travel.pdf . I will continue to monitor the Ebola situation closely.

154026694650252	As part of National Head Start Awareness month, I enjoyed reading to a classroom of 3 year old students today at the The Academy for Children at El Centro in Kansas City, KS. This past week marked the 50th anniversary of Head Start-- their motto for this special occasion is "50 Years of Opportunity." I firmly believe that all children in America should be given the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Educating our children at an early age is essential to ensure success later. Thank you to El Centro for having me read today!	806049416114640
154026694650252	Thank you to Liz Sutherlin and her gracious staff for showing me around the HappyBottoms.org warehouse in Lenexa this week. As the area's largest diaper bank, HappyBottoms will have distributed over 1.2 million diapers by the end of the year to families in need. In fact, they have reached over 1800 babies just this month. As a parent of an infant, I understand the importance of this effort and want to thank HappyBottoms for all they do for babies and families in Kansas City.	805248292861419
101965369880683	The EPA’s ruling today on redefining the “Waters of the United States” is just another example of the Obama Administration doubling down on their policy of regulatory overreach. Kansas farmers have had enough of the government trying to insert themselves into every facet of their business: feeding America and people all over the world. Rest assured, I will continue fighting to make sure that unelected bureaucrats at the EPA don’t implement this misguided and economically crippling rule.	801702003240346

101965369880683	We received word that the fatalities from the helicopter crash in Nepal included Wichitan and U.S. Marine Corps pilot Captain Chris Norgren.  CPT Norgren gave his life helping others.  His mission was as a leader on a team tasked with bringing much needed aid to earthquake victims.  It was, as CPT Norgren knew, work that had to be done.  This tragedy reminds us all that whether on the battlefield or conducting humanitarian relief, our American military service members are daily placed in harm’s way.  They take actions, as did CPT Norgren, that place themselves at risk in order to help others.  These actions are both noble and powerful and bring honor to our country, to our military, and to the families of those who serve.  The loss of a child is something no parent should ever have to endure.  My thoughts and prayers go out to the brave Marine's parents, Ron and Theresa, his sister Jennifer, and all of his family and friends.	797844836959396

101965369880683	Just as the FAA sets consistent regulations allowing pilots to fly cross-country without having to follow different state-dictated protocols, the FDA is the national authority on food labeling guidelines and should have jurisdiction over genetically modified food labels.	717071345036746

91115765425	Whitfield Votes Against President\nObama’s Unconstitutional Executive Amnesty:\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Ed Whitfield (KY-01), voted against the Senate Amendment to H.R. 240 that funds the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2015. Whitfield released the following statement:\n\n“I could not support the bill sent to us today by the United States Senate because it failed to permanently defund President Obama’s unilateral executive amnesty orders,” said Whitfield. “While I support funding the Department of Homeland Security, Congress has a duty to stop the President’s reckless and unconstitutional actions and this was not accomplished by the legislation before us. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats refused to go to conference and I was not willing to cave in to their demands that would jeopardize the fiber of our great nation.”\n\nhttp://whitfield.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/whitfield-votes-against-president-obama-s-unconstitutional-executive	10152582412080426
91115765425	It was a great honor to hear from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning about the threat a nuclear Iran poses to the world. It is critical that we listen carefully to his unique perspective and maintain staunch support for our longtime friend and ally in the battle against world-wide terrorism.  I want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for delivering his impassioned remarks in person, and for his continued support of the United States of America.	10152582161085426
91115765425	The president earned a whopping four Pinocchios this week when a Washington Post fact checker found his claim that #KeystoneXL oil ‘bypasses the U.S.’ to be completely false. The Senate will seek to override the veto this week. Remember when his own job was on the line, the president stood in front of KXL, then turned his back when the jobs of 42K workers were on the line.	10152581884445426
91115765425	Whitfield Votes to Protect our \nHomeland and Avert DHS Shutdown:\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Rep. Ed Whitfield (KY-01) voted today in support of H.R. 33, a short-term Continuing Resolution (CR) that would fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the next seven days. The funding bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 357 to 60. \n\n“President Obama’s executive amnesty order has created a great divide in our country, and violates his obligation to uphold the Constitution,” said Whitfield. “Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed legislation to fully fund DHS and put a stop to the President’s lawless actions. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have obstructed this effort in order to protect the President and avoid debating a bill that a majority of Americans want to see passed. This obstruction has left us with no choice but to pass a one week extension this evening that will ensure our national security efforts remain operational and create a pathway for the House and Senate to conference and reconcile their differences.” \n\nIn the meantime a federal judge has issued an injunction that prohibits the President from implementing his executive order related to immigration.\n\nhttp://whitfield.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/whitfield-votes-to-protect-our-homeland-and-avert-dhs-shutdown	10152575418300426

208189769312073	Yesterday, a federal appeals court denied a request from the Justice Department to allow President Obama’s November executive actions on immigration to take effect, while still pending approval.  The decision is a big win for the 26 states that have already acted to challenge the Administration’s executive amnesty, which were first blocked by a District Court judge in February.  The House has repeatedly voted to block the executive overreach and is committed to ensuring that our nation’s laws are created by the legislature – not by the president, as the Constitution clearly dictates.	638508042946908

208189769312073	Last night, the House approved a series of bills to support America’s veterans. Among those bills are H.R. 474, the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act and H.R. 1816, the Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act.  H.R. 474 contains provisions to assist veterans in achieving meaningful employment, improve the delivery of services to help address the problems facing homeless veterans and to move more veterans and their families out of homelessness and into permanent housing. H.R. 1816 would make reforms to public housing rules to make it possible for more veterans to stay in their homes and receive crucial benefits.  These bills serve as important steps forward in aiding the men and women who have selflessly defended our country and who deserve the best care possible.	634125170051862
208189769312073	Later today the House will vote on S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015.

Last summer I held two roundtable discussions with local law enforcement leaders and social workers, and I know this legislation will have a positive impact on our communities as we work to combat human trafficking throughout Kentucky.	633829960081383
208189769312073	This afternoon the House passed H.R. 1191, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. Should the Administration finalize a deal with Iran regarding that country’s nuclear program, H.R. 1191 will require the President to submit the agreement to Congress and prohibit the President from waiving statutory sanctions while Congress reviews the agreement. Further, the bill gives Congress the opportunity to pass a resolution of disapproval if it is found to be a bad deal, preventing the President from waiving or suspending congressionally imposed sanctions. The Constitution clearly gives Congress an advisory role in such matters and this legislation ensures we can hold hearings and adequately debate the agreement before the Administration moves forward with sanctions relief.	632142850250094

208189769312073	Today the House voted in a historic and bipartisan fashion to put Medicare on a more sustainable path. Today’s vote on the “doc fix” will ensure seniors can continue to see their physicians, reauthorizes the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and takes essential first steps toward shoring up the fiscal health of the Medicare program.  I’m glad to see that nearly 400 of my colleagues supported the effort and that the White House agreed to sign the bill into law.  I hope the Senate acts quickly on the bill.  I hear regularly from Kentuckians who want Washington to start working again and bills like this are important steps toward getting things done.	610642585733454

208189769312073	Five years ago today, Obamacare became law.  It was sold as a bill to make health care more accessible and more affordable, but it has failed to achieve those goals.  Instead, the law has created headaches for businesses and families and resulted in increased health care costs.  The Supreme Court will rule this June on the King v. Burwell case, which could result in an opportunity to address some of the law’s most flawed aspects.  I remain committed to working to institute meaningful reforms that focus on the doctor-patient relationship and actually deliver on accessibility and costs.	608899799241066
208189769312073	Just voted in support of a resolution to express my disapproval of the National Labor Relations Board’s ambush elections rule.

208189769312073	I am closely following this week’s King v. Burwell arguments before the Supreme Court - if successful, the case would deal a crushing blow to Obamacare.

208189769312073	President Obama has made clear this year that he’s not afraid to legislate using his own pen.  But did you know that he has issued more Presidential Memorandums than any other president in our history? These memos are essentially Executive Orders and can establish dangerous precedents. I’m looking forward to the new Congress in January and the historic majority that Republicans will hold. But with it comes a great responsibility – to hold the president accountable and ensure he executes the laws that  Congress writes, not writing laws himself.	559331964197850
452480994776070	I support free trade, but I cannot vote for the #TPA bill that will\nexpedite approval of the #TPP trade agreement.\n\n(1) I've read the confidential TPP. What struck me most was the enormity of it. Two bound volumes that reference other bound volumes of trade agreements. My staff aren't allowed to read the document, I'm not allowed to take notes from the room, and I can't access an Internet browser in the room. How could I possibly understand the unintended consequences of this agreement over the next few decades?\n\n(2) The implications of ceding our sovereignty to the World Trade Organization (#WTO) via trade agreements became painfully obvious to me this week. Congress literally rewrote our food labeling laws to please the WTO. The WTO said we can't require the country of origin to be on the labels for beef and pork. I voted against removing the labels but the WTO-directed legislation passed anyway.\n\n(3) Phone calls from my constituents are running 30 to 1, opposing versus supporting, the TPA. Some are concerned that this agreement gives this President too much additional authority. Some are concerned about the lack of transparency. These are both valid concerns.	1020214978002666

452480994776070	Congressmen were surprised when I forced a reading of the DHS funding bill yesterday.  Imagine that – reading a bill before voting!  This short NPR segment (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34VPABKtSqY) explains a bit of what happened, but I'll give more details below. Please SHARE:\n\nYesterday, after Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech, most members left the House chamber.  I stayed in case previously-rejected DHS legislation was brought up for passage in an empty chamber.  One hour after the Prime Minister's speech ended, DHS legislation from the Senate arrived in the House and a motion was made to concur with (i.e. pass) the Senate version which would do nothing to stop the President's executive action on illegal immigration.  According to House rules, all bills must first be read, but the  reading of a bill is almost always waived with a unanimous consent request. In order to give my conservative colleagues time to get to the floor, I "objected to the motion to suspend the reading" and the clerk began the long process of reading the 96 page bill.\n\nThe clerk read the bill for nearly 20 minutes, which gave enough time for members who care deeply about the issue to come to the floor.  I then withdrew my objection (so the clerk could quit reading) and made a motion to table the Senate version because it did nothing to defund the President's executive action on illegal immigration.  My motion to table the Senate legislation garnered 140 republican votes, but failed because some republicans and all democrats voted against my motion.  We then began debate on the Senate bill.\n\nThe rules allowed for one hour of debate, at which point a democrat representative and a republican representative (who made the original motion to concur with the Senate language) each claimed half the time.  However, because they were both in favor of the legislation, I was able to claim and manage 1/3 of the time (20 minutes) to debate in opposition.  I yielded time to at least a dozen of my colleagues who spoke eloquently against enabling the President's executive action through this appropriation bill.  After debate concluded, there was a voice vote to pass the Senate legislation and the chair found in favor of the Aye's.  At that point I requested a recorded vote which was granted.  Over 69% of republicans (167 of 242) voted against the Senate version, but it passed anyway because all of the democrats joined 75 republicans to vote in favor.	964919823532182
452480994776070	The media has failed to fully explain what happened with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bills yesterday so I'll offer my "front row seat" description.  Please SHARE:\n\nIn December while Senator Reid was still majority leader in the Senate, Congress passed, and the President signed, a bill called the CR/Omnibus that funded all government for a year except for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Republican leadership in the House decided it would be best to fund DHS only until February 27th.  We were promised  this would allow a republican controlled Senate and House to craft a funding bill for DHS that would defund, and thereby stop, the President's executive action on illegal immigration.  This promise was instrumental in securing republican votes for the December CR/Omnibus.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, per the plan, the House passed a full year funding bill for DHS that would have prevented the President's executive action on illegal immigration from being implemented.  This was hardly mentioned in the media.  For their part, the Senate engaged in brinksmanship and waited until yesterday, February 27th, to pass their version of a bill to fund DHS for the year.  For what it's worth, the Senate bill would do absolutely nothing to stop the President's executive action.\n\nWhen the Senate and House both pass different versions of the same bill (in this case a DHS funding bill), and neither agrees to the text of the other chamber's bill, typically the leadership of the two chambers appoint conferees who meet in a conference and hammer out a compromise bill.  This compromise bill, also known as a conference bill, then returns to both chambers for an up or down vote.\n\nYesterday at 2:43pm the House took a good faith vote to go to conference and negotiate with the Senate.  In a conference, it is understood that neither side will get everything it wants.  A vote against going to conference is sometimes characterized in the media as obstructing the legislative process.  I voted to go to conference, while every Democrat voted against going to conference.  The motion to go to conference passed the House, but hasn't yet passed the Senate. Senate Democrats are expected to block a motion to go to conference on Monday when the Senate reconvenes.\n\n (http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll102.xml)\n\nFaced with a Senate that refused to negotiate, House leadership acquiesced and offered on the floor a bill identical to the Senate bill that did nothing to stop the President's executive action on illegal immigration.  However, this proposal limited DHS funding to 3 weeks instead of the full year.   52 House republicans, myself included, voted against the 3 week spending bill because it contained no guarantee that the Senate would vote to go to conference to negotiate a compromise bill before the temporary funding ran out.  Although passage of the 3 week spending bill would have signaled retreat on the part of the Republicans, Democrats calculated that if they defeated the temporary spending bill, they could get the full year Senate bill passed yesterday, so they voted against the 3 week bill as well.  The bill failed yesterday evening at 5:13pm. (http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll104.xml)\n\nImmediately after this bill died, conservatives in the House offered to vote for a 3 week DHS funding bill if it contained the modest requirement that the Senate come to conference to negotiate a long term compromise bill.  House republican leadership rejected the proposal from conservatives. \n\nFaced with DHS funding expiring at midnight, yet unwilling to negotiate in conference, Senate leadership reached out to House republican leadership and minority leader Pelosi.  The Senate offered to pass a one week version of their DHS bill that would do nothing to stop the President's executive action, if minority leader Pelosi would guarantee all of the democrats' votes in the House.  House Democrats were told if they would vote for the temporary measure, then within a week Congress would pass a DHS bill that would allow the President's executive action on illegal immigration to be carried out.  A deal was struck, the Senate passed their version by unanimous consent and adjourned, leaving the House with no other options to avert a lapse in DHS funding.  At 9:59pm the House passed the temporary Senate measure, although I joined 54 other conservative republicans in opposing it. (http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll106.xml)\n\nIn summary, using the power of the purse to keep the executive branch in check is a legitimate and constitutional strategy, but our republican leadership chose poorly last December when selecting security funding as a point of leverage.  Having backed themselves into a corner, last night House republican leadership abandoned their own plan and struck a deal with minority leader Pelosi that gave the President what he wanted for at least another week.  In my estimation, the long term prospect of using the power of the purse to stop the President's unilateral action is bleak now that House leadership has signaled a temporary retreat without gaining a single concession from the Senate.	962987330392098

It was scheduled to expire last month. \n\nUnfortunately, last month there were only 7 of us in the House (Amash, Broun, Jones, Massie, McClintock, Sensenbrenner, Stockman) who voted against renewing what amounted to a tax payer subsidy of insurance companies and urban living.

452480994776070	There are news reports this week that someone from North Korea hacked #Sony Pictures, an American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony.\n\nAs someone in the Obama administration was fond of saying, "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. … This crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not before."\n\nIn this spirit, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), an advocate of the unconstitutional Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act #CISPA, said of the Sony hack, "this is only the latest example of the need for serious legislation to improve the sharing of information between the private sector and the government to help companies strengthen cybersecurity. We must pass an information sharing bill as quickly as possible next year."\n\nThe Senator from California expressed righteous indignation when the government spied on her, but she's fine with expanding the warrantless surveillance of every American.  In light of this much hyped "cyberwar," do you think the Obama administration will now support #CISPA?  Do you think the government should have unfettered realtime online access to your private information?  Do you think the government should grant immunity to corporations if they violate your 4th amendment rights?\n\nI'm urging you to learn everything  you can about the CISPA bill.  I voted against it, but it passed the House.  It stalled in the senate under veto threat from the President. Unfortunately, I look for it to be fast tracked next year, using the Sony hack and other so called "crises" to give legislators and #POTUS cover in the mainstream media.\n\nhttp://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll117.xml	919316401425858

The people of the Commonwealth chose to have Ford in the foxhole with them time and again, electing him to consecutive terms as lieutenant governor, governor and senator. \n \nAlthough he was a staunch Democrat, Senator Ford never hesitated to reach across the aisle for issues that benefited Kentucky the most, from promoting the development of coal-based synthetic fuels to protecting tobacco farmers. \n \nHe shed a new light on Kentucky country boys in Frankfort and Washington, proving that we always keep our word, we never back down from a challenge, and showing a little kindness goes a long way. \n \nHe was a true statesman for Kentucky who not only impacted change for today, but for tomorrow and generations to follow. My wife Cynthia and I offer our deepest condolences to his wife, Jean and the host of family and friends who stood steady by his side through the years.	10152806037389086

457461137635018	Yesterday afternoon, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Richard Cordray announced that, due to an administrative error, his Bureau would be delaying the effective date of the Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Integrated Disclosure (TRID) regulation required by the Dodd-Frank Act from August 1 until October 1, 2015. \n\nThe Bureau continues its day-late and dollar-short approach to providing the regulatory relief requested by the public, the housing industry, and the 254 Members of Congress who signed my letter to Director Cordray requesting a grace period for TRID enforcement through the end of the year.\n\nThe Bureau’s decision to delay the TRID implementation date has some benefits.  Real estate businesses will appreciate the additional time to finalize their new procedures.  Buyers will no longer face the threat of delays at closing during the busiest home buying season of the year.  However, this temporary delay does nothing to allow industry participants to test their systems in the real world before the effective date.  The consequences may be unnecessary fines for the industry and delays in real estate closings for American families this fall.\n\nSince this delay was the result of an error by the Bureau, I hope they will see the light that innocent mistakes by buyers and sellers of real estate trying to comply in good faith with this complicated new rule may happen – which is precisely why I will continue to advocate for an initial grace period for TRID enforcement after the rule goes into effect.	868938499820611

457461137635018	Today, I voted against a Senate amendment to a Department of Homeland Security funding bill.  I have voted to fund the Department of Homeland Security three times since January.  However, Senate Democrats blocked a conference committee, an important step in the legislative process that would have addressed differences between the House-passed bill and the Senate amendment.\n \nWhen there are differences between bills passed in the House and Senate, a conference committee is the appropriate way to resolve those differences.  The American people want us to find solutions and they are tired of a minority of Senators who refuse to even attempt to find common ground.  I support a return to regular order and I take seriously my oath to support and defend the Constitution.  I am therefore unwilling to rubberstamp a Senate amendment which fails to address any of the serious concerns expressed by the House, a federal court and the President himself about his unconstitutional overreach.	795136190534176
457461137635018	As a Governor and U.S. Senator, Wendell Ford always upheld the highest ideals of public service.

457461137635018	The President's address was a missed opportunity.  One of the central messages from the last election was that people are tired of the President’s obsession with dividing Americans. They deserve leadership that will unite the country to solve big problems. They deserve a President who will do more than just give lip service to national unity but actually work with Congress to enact pro-growth policies that will produce jobs, opportunity, and a healthy economy for all Americans. \n \nInstead, the President doubled down on the same divisive policies of higher taxes to pay for bigger government, bypassing Congress through unilateral executive orders and costly regulations, and issuing veto threats to bipartisan jobs bills.\n \nThis Congress has and will continue to pass legislation with proven bipartisan support.  I hope the President will abandon his divisive agenda and work with us, not against us, to put America on a better, more prosperous path.	775587855822343
457461137635018	Happy New Year! \n\nWith the new year comes the beginning of a new Congress. In this new Congress, we will have the opportunity to work with a functioning Senate that will allow the legislative process to work so we can advance policies, whether Republican or Democrat in origin, that will get results for the American people and improve our nation for future generations. \n\nIn the 114th Congress, I look forward to upholding my commitment to my Accessibility Initiative and listening to the ideas and concerns of the people of the Sixth District; advocating for Kentucky’s signature bourbon, equine, energy, agriculture and manufacturing industries; and working to advance commonsense solutions in Washington. \n\nI remain humbled by the opportunity to serve. Thank you.	765416463506149
457461137635018	BREAKING NEWS: A provision I championed in Congress that is critical to Kentucky’s signature equine industry is heading to the President's desk to be signed into law as part of H.R. 5771, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014.\n \nBased off legislation I introduced last year known as H.R. 2212, the Race Horse Cost Recovery Act, Section 121 of H.R. 5771 extends through the end of 2014 the three-year depreciation schedule for all racehorses that expired at the end of 2013.\n \nI appreciate House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp’s support and was glad to work with the Ways and Means Committee to include my provision to ensure the continued vitality of Kentucky’s signature horse racing industry. This provision also reaches beyond the Bluegrass to protect the 1.4 million direct and indirect jobs that support America’s horse industry, as well as a large number of other agriculture industries that rely on a vibrant horse industry for their own survival.  While a permanent fix is still preferred, this provision provides certainty to owners that placed yearlings into service in the 2014 calendar year.  \n\nI will continue to advocate for a tax code that promotes economic growth and supports our signature equine industry and all Kentuckians.	757289364318859

457461137635018	While I'm disappointed that the Senate continues to block legislation I voted for last week that would have nullified the President's Executive Order on immigration, this bill does successfully build upon the modest progress made in last year's Bipartisan Budget Agreement to further reduce spending, and it delivers on a number of important priorities for the people of Kentucky. The short-term nature of the portion of the bill that funds the Department of Homeland Security will allow the next Congress to effectively respond to the President's illegal immigration actions, once Republicans take control of the Senate.\n\nClick here to read more about how this bill will protect Kentucky priorities, including rolling back the extreme EPA to protect Kentucky coal and agriculture, ensuring full funding for the Blue Grass Army Depot to complete their mission, and slashing funding for the IRS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – the primary agencies responsible for the implementation of Obamacare: http://barr.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/barr-statement-on-bill-to-keep-the-government-open	755232667857862
457461137635018	Today I joined a majority of my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives in response to President Obama’s unlawful Executive Order to pass H.R. 5759, the “Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act.”\n \nThe President has ignored the will of the American people and circumvented Congress and taken unilateral action that fails to fulfill his duty to faithfully execute the laws. The legislation I voted for today reaffirms the constitutional principles that only Congress has the power to write immigration laws and that the President must enforce those laws; prevents the President from suspending our immigration laws; prohibits the Administration from unilaterally granting amnesty or work permits to undocumented immigrants and declares null and void the President’s recent Executive Action. \n\nKentuckians want Congress to secure our border first and the House has already passed legislation to do that with my support.  We must act to secure the border first, strengthen the immigration system and protect American citizens.	751913331523129

457461137635018	Congratulations to Dr. Jay Box on being named the next President of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS). I look forward to continuing the successful partnership that current President, Dr. Michael McCall, and my office has enjoyed and wish Dr. McCall all the best in his retirement.	745763128804816

457461137635018	Today, I joined my colleagues in the House of Representatives in passing legislation to finally end the Obama Administration’s six years of foot-dragging on approving the Keystone XL pipeline, which will create an estimated 40,000 jobs and improve our North American energy security.  Even the President’s own State Department found that the project will have no net impact on global greenhouse gas emissions.  It is my hope that the Senate will join with the House in heeding the calls of our fellow citizens to put political gamesmanship aside and embrace policies, such as this one, that put the American people back to work and reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East.	742898685757927
457461137635018	I congratulate Lt. Governor Jerry Abramson on his appointment as the head of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. Jerry has great experience at the state and local level and I am glad to see a Kentuckian appointed to this important position.  \n\nI look forward to working with him on behalf of the residents of the Sixth Congressional District.	739208099460319
457461137635018	Yesterday I was glad to contribute some “sweat equity” to help the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and @Scott County Habitat for Humanity on their newest build for Georgetown resident Matt Owens. \n\nI was delighted to raise these walls with Mr. Owens and many affordable housing advocates whose service stretches across Scott County and the whole Commonwealth. Habitat is helping build better lives, and we are grateful for the continuing support it receives from the FHLBank and Whitaker Bank in this important work.\n\nSpecial thanks to Scott County Habitat for Humanity Co-founder, Tom Scholl, whom I was honored to present with a Congressional Record Statement for his dedication and service to our community.	720703714644091
457461137635018	Today I had the opportunity to learn what it is like to be a Bourbon distiller! Thanks to the team at the Barrel House Distilling Company  in Lexington for an incredible experience - they are a great example of local entrepreneurship at its finest.\n\nI was also glad to discuss some much-needed modifications to current tax policy that puts Kentucky's signature Bourbon industry at a competitive disadvantage. I will continue to advocate for passage of my legislation, H.R 2313, the Aged Distilled Spirits Competitiveness Act of 2013, which would amend the tax code to end the inequitable tax treatment of aged distilled spirits such as Bourbon.	720693994645063
457461137635018	I’d like to wish  a happy, healthy and sweet New Year to everyone celebrating the Rosh Hashanah holiday!	719883171392812
457461137635018	I am glad that another bipartisan agreement that passed the House with my support is on its way to becoming law. Earlier this year, the House passed H.R. 4980, the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act. Last week, the Senate followed suit. This legislation will help fight child sex trafficking, encourage adoption, and improve the child support system.\n \nThe House has passed more than a dozen bills to prevent human trafficking and support its victims, as well as dozens of bills to help create jobs. While more work is needed to protect vulnerable children and get Kentuckians back to work, this bipartisan bill becoming law represents a constructive step forward.	719545531426576
457461137635018	We find ourselves at the perilous point of a nearly failed state of Iraq, accompanied by the virtually unchecked movement of one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations the world has ever known, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).  I believe that ISIL presents a grave threat to our allies, our citizens, and our homeland.  However, I remain concerned that the President’s current strategy is insufficient to meet the challenge of defeating ISIL. I support today’s bipartisan passage of an Amendment authorizing a “train-and-equip” approach because Congress added several provisions that will enhance Congressional oversight, require detailed progress reports, increase monitoring the use of equipment and demand information on how the authority fits within the President’s larger regional strategy.\n\nI also believe that over the next two months, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) and the American public would greatly benefit from the testimony of retired senior ranking military commanders who have personal experience fighting in Iraq and first-hand knowledge of strategies that have proven effective on Iraq’s battlefields. I have sent a letter to HASC Chairman Buck McKeon encouraging him to hold hearings with these battlefield commanders as their perspective would provide the United States and Coalition Forces the vital insight and expertise needed to pursue the right strategy and give our warfighters everything they need to achieve victory.	717209034993559
457461137635018	ATTN STUDENTS: Hope to see you on Saturday at Military Academy Day! If you are interested in applying to one of the nation’s service academies, you don’t want to miss this opportunity to speak with representatives from the academies. The event will be held on Saturday, September 13th at the Aviation Museum of Kentucky from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, with registration beginning at 9:30 AM.	714526201928509
457461137635018	Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Army Corps of Engineers issued a rule vastly expanding the definition of waters regulated by the Clean Water Act to cover every stream, pond, wetland, and even dry ditches (they  could potentially fill with rain water!) across this country. The result of this blatant regulatory overreach would require any private citizen seeking to divert a stream or a pond on their own land, any construction firm building a road, or any farmer irrigating their crops to obtain a complicated permit which could take months or years to acquire, or face tens of thousands of dollars in fines per each they are in violation of this flawed, one-size-fits-all rule.  \n\nThat’s why I am glad to support today’s House-passage of H.R. 5078, the Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act, which is a commonsense bill to prevent this disastrous rulemaking and require the federal government to consult with and consider the suggestions of our state and local representative before drafting a new rule regulating our nation’s waters.	714050095309453
457461137635018	Today I was happy to join Eric Frankl, Executive Director of Blue Grass Airport, and Nancy Wiser, Chair of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Airport Board, to announce a $15 million grant to fund safety improvements at the Blue Grass Airport. We worked with Eric and the FAA to ensure the funding was awarded in a timely manner to begin the first phase of a project that will substantially improve the flow and safety of the taxiway. The safety of our citizens and visitors to the Bluegrass is paramount, and the Taxiway Safety Enhancement Program will pave the way for future growth. When the Bluegrass Airport is successful, it means we are creating jobs here in Kentucky.	711182365596226

457461137635018	Another event that I've held during this August work period was "Lunch with your Congressman" at Galvins in Georgetown. During the meeting, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to present Clarence Craycraft with the medals he earned during his 21 years of service in the United States Navy. For over 43 years, Mr. Craycraft tried to obtain his service medals with no success. He most recently inquired two separate times with the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), which they never responded to him.\n\nOnce my office was notified, we were able to work with NPRC to obtain his medals in just a few short weeks. Following the presentation I was able to speak to "Lunch With Your Congressman" attendees about their concerns and how I can best represent them in Washington. \n\nYou can read more about this event in the Georgetown News-Graphic article, Barr: VA controversy, economy trouble voters at http://www.news-graphic.com/news/article_d8758fc0-2e2f-11e4-98df-0019bb2963f4.html	709375895776873

372154186772	Fox News Shock: Jonathan Gruber was not paid just $400,000 to help Obama lie to us. He was paid almost $6 million to lie to America about ObamaCare.	10152693395631773
372154186772	ObamaCare architect, Gruber, after a political storm walks back statements made in a moment of candor. Instead of deceitful language, ObamaCare merely had typos, he says. He now says that SCOTUS should divine the wishes and intent of Congress yet again so the law will survive---but different than it passed. Isn't Congress supposed to fix its own mistakes?\n\nhttp://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2014/11/11/Obamacare-Architect-Apologizes-Admits-Law-Incomplete-Has-Typos	10152682238711773

372154186772	FNC announcement: Obama has delayed his action for executive amnesty until after the Nov. elections. It's clear that even he knows this is unpopular with the American people.	10152542624056773
372154186772	Congress must still live with the laws it creates. Five years ago we stood together in the midst of the health care debate to send that message to Washington. I drafted House Resolution 615 because some members of Congress were trying to exempt themselves from the requirements of the health care law they were writing. I've now reintroduced HRes 615 because some members still want out from the burden the Obamacare burdens they imposed on you.\n\nToday, I am still fighting on this issue and I want to hear back from you.	10152422678106773

91529332807	As we spend time with friends and family today, I hope everyone takes a moment to think about the real meaning of the Memorial Day holiday—a day to honor and remember all of the men and women who have died in service to our country.  They gave their lives in defense of our freedom, our security and our values.  We are the country we are today because of their sacrifices	10153268608337808
91529332807	Encouraged to hear reports that Comcast is dropping proposed merger with Time Warner Cable. This was a bad idea from the start and, although the big cable companies kept telling us it was going to be a good deal for consumers, the public knew better.	10153195256497808
91529332807	Surprised to hear former Congressman and good friend Barney Frank on Conan O'Brien's show sharing what I think about the accuracy House of Cards. 1) Members of Congress are not that evil, and 2) we're not that clever either. http://bit.ly/1De3tMC	10153190263442808
91529332807	There is no better legal advocate to argue in front of the Supreme Court for marriage equality than Maine's own Mary Bonauto. From her work in the Goodridge case in Massachusetts to her involvement in Maine's work on marriage equality, Mary is a fierce champion for the rights of all citizens and I couldn’t be more proud of her selection.	10153139623512808

91529332807	Looking forward to the President's State of the Union address tonight and hoping he'll talk about issues important to Maine's working families, like giving workers paid sick leave and making college more affordable.	10152980381162808
91529332807	Very proud to be sworn into the 114th Congress today. Serving the people of Maine is the greatest honor of my life and I'm grateful to be able to get back to work fighting for the issues they care about in Washington.  While Congress has become more and more partisan, I will continue looking for ways to get things done that benefit Maine families and Maine's economy.	10152949844617808
91529332807	Yesterday I voted against spending millions on arms for Syrian rebels.    I think the actions of ISIS are absolutely reprehensible, but am concerned about getting involved in military actions that could lead to the deployment of U.S. troops.  Instead, we should be focusing on economic and diplomatic approaches to cutting off the flow of weapons and finding a political solution to these conflicts.	10152672423182808
91529332807	Hoping we all have the chance today to take a moment to remember those we lost on 9-11 and the way the country came together in those darkest of days.	10152657010027808
91529332807	The Supreme Court has once again given corporate entities the same rights as individuals, allowing #HobbyLobby to withhold birth control coverage for its employees on religious grounds. Women earn this benefit and deserve access to a critical part of their healthcare. Whether or not a woman uses it should be up to her, not the company she works for.	10152486508892808

91529332807	Among the many reasons to dislike the Paul Ryan's budget proposal: eliminating funding for the highly successful Downeaster passenger rail line, and over 40 other Amtrak lines across the country. Other reasons for my strong opposition include privatizing Medicare, cutting taxes for the wealthy, and undercutting Food Stamps.  This is not a proposal that moves our country forward.	10152292516852808
91529332807	Thanks to everyone for the birthday wishes! Let me return the favor and wish a happy belated birthday to my good friend, Senator Angus S. King, Jr.!	10152275803697808
91529332807	At tonight's State of the Union address, I hope to hear clear plans from the President for helping the middle class and working families, and I hope Congress actually listens and gives them the consideration they deserve.  What are you hoping to hear?	10152140020857808
91529332807	Letting unemployment benefits expire is not just cruel to those struggling to find work, it's bad for the economy, too.  Every week we don't extend benefits, Maine's economy loses $1 million that would have been spent at local businesses. http://1.usa.gov/1lzcJEx	10152094516477808
91529332807	As Congress reconvenes, I'm asking House leaders to bring an extension of unemployment benefits to a vote.  Here's one reason why: only 21 percent of Maine's unemployed can now get benefits since the extension expired. http://1.usa.gov/1aaFeE3	10152092912352808
91529332807	I opposed the budget deal passed by the House last night.  I'm glad that it will help us avoid another crippling gov't shutdown, but it's still a bad deal for working families and retirees, including members of the military. We shouldn't ask these folks to make even more sacrifices when big companies and the wealthy still aren't being asked to pay their fair share.	10152037783492808
91529332807	The outpouring of emotion about Nelson Mandela is truly moving.  \n\nEven when faced with the cruelty of apartheid, even when he was put in prison for his political beliefs, he continued to believe that peace, nonviolence and dialogue would triumph over injustice.  \n\nWhat a great loss.	10152021504132808

91529332807	Bittersweet day.  I'm relieved we finally reached a bipartisan deal to reopen gov't and avoid default, which means thousands of people can get back to work, and seniors and veterans don't have to worry about getting the benefits they've earned.  But we could have voted on this same bill two weeks ago if the House GOP wasn't so intent on holding the country hostage for political leverage.  It cost our economy $26 billion, not to mention needless worry for millions of people.  I hope they learn that this isn't a game in time to avoid another manufactured crisis.	10151888143317808

508912729153334	Today, I voted against the extension of the outdated Trade Adjustment Assistance program, as well as the “fast-track” process to grant President Obama Trade Promotional Authority (TPA).

Aidan Brehm, Arran Goldman, Ian Goldman, and Riya Khosla designed a cochlear implant that uses nano-technology and graphene to improve the quality of sound for patients who suffer from severe hearing loss.  They improved upon a limited design to aid the nearly half million people who depend on cochlear implants to communicate.The creativity, innovation, and knowledge these four finalists demonstrated in their implant device shows the promise our future has in the hands of these kids.	974967122547890

508912729153334	Today, I voted against the Department of Homeland Security bill that allows President Obama’s unlawful executive amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants. The President ignored the Constitution and the will of the American people when he took executive action on immigration. I believe that Congress should use its power of the purse to fund the Department of Homeland Security, while stopping the President's unconstitutional actions.	920687671309169

508912729153334	Tonight, we heard the President outline his plan for the country and unfortunately we have heard it all before - more taxes, more spending. President Obama claims to want to help hard-working taxpayers, yet he continues to advocate for the failing policies that have hampered job creation and growth in the economy. He made it clear that he wants to raise taxes again, while continuing to spend even more money we do not have.  The House will continue to focus on legislation that will help hard-working taxpayers and improve the economic environment for job creators, such as moving forward and building the Keystone Pipeline, and dialing back government overregulation.	899112466800023
508912729153334	Today I voted to block the President's executive action on immigration.  The President’s unilateral actions on immigration have completely undermined our legal immigration system in the United States. While I agree that our immigration system is broken and needs to be fixed, granting blanket amnesty will only encourage those outside the U.S. to come here illegally, The appropriations bill we passed today will fund important functions of the Department of Homeland Security, like enhanced border security and anti-terrorist measures, while putting the interests of those who are entering this country through the legal immigration system ahead of those who are here illegally.	895792567132013

282861997886	I was pleased to see our Maryland state and local lawmakers along with their staff and interns on Capitol Hill today to hear from our Congressional delegation about issues in Congress affecting our state. I want to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Ben Cardin, for hosting them and all of the elected officials for the hard work they are doing in Annapolis and across Maryland to meet the budgetary and legislative challenges of our day.  I look forward to continuing to work with them  in Congress.	10152989883027887
282861997886	Today I was proud to participate in one of the most unique and storied activities in the modern history of our state, former Maryland State Senator Bernie Fowler's Annual Wade-In. He holds this event each year to assess how far he can wade into the Patuxent River until he can no longer see his white sneakers, a non-scientific measurement known as the ‘sneaker index.’  The informal index brings awareness to improving the health of the Patuxent River.	10152986378347887

282861997886	VIDEO: I spoke on the House Floor today in opposition to Republicans' National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which undermines our national security by honoring dangerous sequester levels. http://bit.ly/1e49QfI	10152910675617887
282861997886	VIDEO: Today I spoke on the House Floor during a Special Order hour on the Supreme Court's consideration of marriage equality next week. Thanks to the extraordinary courage of millions who have come out to their friends, the majority of Americans now agree that every loving couple ought to be treated equally and have their right to marry recognized. I anticipate that the Court will uphold the value of equality and recognize LGBT couples’ equal right to marriage. http://bit.ly/1KaccUH	10152871099257887
282861997886	Instead of taking legislative action to strengthen our economy, create jobs, and get things done for the American people, House Republicans have spent the last 100 days on partisan messaging bills, political gimmicks, and internal divisions that have only added to their record of dysfunction and obstruction. Here’s a look at House Republicans’ failed record during the first 100 days in the 114th Congress – by the numbers: http://1.usa.gov/1FLVyGL	10152853029607887

282861997886	House Republicans' budget resolution for Fiscal Year 2016 is ill-conceived, unrealistic, and unworkable. Instead of making the tough choices needed to invest in our nation's future in a fiscally sustainable way, their budget proposal uses partisan gimmicks to pretend to balance and imposes irresponsible, dramatic cuts well below sequester levels for our domestic priorities. Take a look at several charts illustrating how extreme the House Republican budget is:	10152804914812887

324527257655694	Thank you to Senator Joanne C. Benson for inviting Whip Steny Hoyer and me to Francis Scott Key Elementary School and Suitland High School, Whip Hoyer’s alma mater. We had a very informative discussion at both schools about the challenges facing local students and the role we all have to play in giving them a chance to succeed. Very impressed by the Prince George’s County Education Coalition’s efforts to organize and mobilize the community.  We were joined by so many leaders who are committed to making a difference in the community, including: Senator Ulysses Currie, Councilwoman Karen Toles of the Prince George’s County Council, Dr. Denise Greene, PGCPS Area 1 Associate Superintendent; Cora Rice Elementary School Principal Mattie Thurman,  Judge Sylvania Woods Principal Michelle Williams, Thomas Claggett Elementary School Principal Jeanetta Rainey, Francis Scott Key Elementary School Principal Judie Strawbridge, Suitland High School Principal Nathan Newman,  Abdul-Raheem Abdullah, co-founder of the Prince George’s County Education Coalition; Taab Bishop, Vice President Verizon; PGCEC Parent Engagement Specialist Dr. Akeda Pearson, Dr. Lynn Long and Dr. Andre Stevenson of Bowie State University, and Dr. Clifford Thomas of Lead by Example.	755320887909660
324527257655694	Today I voted to give the Trade Promotion Authority to President Obama and to extend the TAA jobs training program. I support giving President Obama the ability to negotiate and complete new trade agreements with some of the fastest growing economies in the world. I want our country and this President setting the terms on trade, not China. Getting trade policy right is huge for our economy and huge for Maryland. This is about creating Maryland jobs by selling Maryland products to Asia, moving right from Western Maryland farms out through the Port of Baltimore. \n\nBut at the same time, I am concerned that we failed to reauthorize the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which helps Americans who have been hurt by globalization learn new skills and find new jobs. This could really hurt real people, people that our Democratic values demand we help. I grew up in a blue collar union household and we’ve seen how globalization and technology have changed our economy. To create good paying jobs we have to start bending these forces to our economic benefit and that starts with smart trade policy. – John	753686198073129
324527257655694	Important votes on trade policy are expected this week, on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for the President and on Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). Today, I met with White House officials and they reiterated the strong case that Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez has made for the TAA legislation and for his strong support for TPA generally. Designed to help workers negatively impacted by changes in trade, TAA should be a key component of any pro-worker trade deal.  No one questions Secretary Perez’s knowledge on these issues or his commitment to helping workers. Secretary Perez has made it clear that the President’s trade agenda is good for our country.\n\nAs I stated last month, I support giving President Obama the ability to negotiate a trade deal that protects workers, protects the environment and protects human rights. Trade Promotion Authority allows the President to finalize an agreement, which Congress will have 60 days to review and vote on. Twelve Presidents have been given this ability since the 1930s and I believe President Obama should as well. I will support both measures, TAA and TPA.  - John	752963781478704

324527257655694	Memorial Day is a moment to honor the American servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, a sacred time on the calendar to remember the men and women who didn’t come home. Memorial Day is a reminder of the incredible dedication shown by all of our active duty servicemembers, veterans and their families because of the stakes of service. From Yorktown to Belleau Wood to Fallujah, on land, at sea and in the air American troops have fought and died for our country. Our safety, our way of life, our country’s existence is owed to them. - John	743410259100723

324527257655694	Today we honor the victims and survivors of the Holocaust, we remember their lives, mourn their suffering, and pledge never to forget the cost of inaction. Holocaust Remembrance Day is an important moment for all of us to stand together and say ‘never again.’ Holocaust Remembrance Day is an opportunity to renew our commitment to ending injustice, bigotry and anti-Semitism, both in our own community and around the globe. Last week, vandals spray-painted hateful messages on a Gaithersburg synagogue, reminding Marylanders that even in our own state, our work to confront hatred and intolerance is not over. - John	728155963959486

Trains should not derail in our country. Mr. Gilani’s family and all Marylanders deserve a quick and timely investigation, as well as swift action to ensure that this never happens again.

Their dedication to begin anew in the aftermath of the Holocaust serves as an example of the power of steadfast determination.\n \nAbove all, on this day we rededicate ourselves to remember the lessons of the Holocaust and to renew our determination to never forget and to speak out and act against intolerance and injustice. The fight against ignorance and malice is not over, but the strength of the Jewish people in the face of the Holocaust should inspire hope in us all as we continue the struggle for peace.	10152931645388878
109304033877	The acts of vandalism against Shaare Torah in Gaithersburg are shameful displays of prejudice and hatred and are not representative of our community’s values of respect and dignity.

Her legacy of compassion and activism helped changed our nation for the better, and we continue the fight for sensible, responsible gun control legislation. We remember her extraordinary service and extend our deepest condolences to her family.	10152902367098878
109304033877	I’m happy to join my friends in Maryland and across the world in recognizing World Autism Awareness Day. Awareness is a necessity for action, and in the past year we have seen tangible results thanks to the efforts of the autism community with the ABLE Act and the Autism CARES Act signed into law. It was an honor to work in partnership with the autism community to pass both pieces of legislation, which are now improving the lives of individuals with autism and their families. I look forward to continuing to fight alongside the autism community to invest in research and education, improve access to health care and services, and advance policies to help every person reach their full potential.	10152898748293878
109304033877	In developing the Democratic alternative budget, we sought and received input from all parts of our Democratic Caucus. The result is a budget that I believe reflects the values and priorities of our Democratic Caucus, and the values and priorities of the American public. While no budget offers each and every idea we might include as individuals, the final product is a powerful vision of how to reward Americans who are working hard to get ahead and to promote economic opportunity for all Americans.\n\nBoth the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) and the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) budgets contain some important ideas and initiatives that are not included in the Democratic alternative budget.  I believe that both are far superior to the Republican budgets on the Floor today.\n\nThe CBC budget contains additional investments in education and other areas that I support and believe are important to our future.  While the plan includes somewhat higher revenues and spending than in the Democratic alternative and the President’s request, I support the increased investment and revenue levels it provides.  \n\nThe Progressive budget also contains many initiatives and policy changes I support that are not included in the Democratic alternative budget, including a 4 percent cost-of-living pay increase for federal employees to  help compensate for years of pay freezes. I also support adding a public option to the ACA exchanges, a proposal that is included in the CBC plan.  In addition, I support a financial market trading fee, and have put forward an “Action Plan to Grow the Paychecks of All, Not Just the Wealthy Few” that would use the revenue to provide more tax relief to the middle class and those working to join the middle class. The tax relief includes paycheck tax credits for American workers, as well as a number of incentives for apprenticeships and training programs and for employee profit-sharing and retirement savings. One of those incentives would use tax policy to leverage higher pay for hard working employees.  Specifically, the CEO-Employee Paycheck Fairness Act, which I introduced, prevents corporations from claiming tax deductions for CEO and executive bonuses and other compensation over $1 million, unless their workers are getting paycheck increases that reflect increases in worker productivity and the cost of living.  The action plan also includes a modernized and expanded Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit that goes beyond the President’s proposal in important ways, including by making it refundable.\n\nSimilarly, I strongly support putting a price on carbon, and have introduced legislation – the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act – to create a cap and dividend program to reliably lower carbon emissions and auction off permits to the first-sellers of fossil fuels. I believe it is important, however, to offset potential increases in energy costs for American homeowners, so my bill provides a dividend to every American. Professor James Boyce of the University of Massachusetts – Amherst has calculated that this approach will leave about 80 percent of American families with more money in their pocket at the end of the day.  This legislation has been endorsed by Bill McKibben and key organizations including the Sierra Club, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, and Communities United (Maryland). \n\nIn the case of both of these policies, the Progressive Caucus budget spends the proceeds on other program priorities. It has $2.7 trillion more spending than in the President’s budget and the Democratic alternative, and $2 trillion more the CBC budget. The Progressive Caucus budget has $5 trillion more revenue over ten years than both the President’s budget and the Democratic alternative budget, and almost $4 trillion more than the CBC budget. This is in part because the CPC budget does not rebate all of the carbon tax and does not use revenue from the financial market trading fee for tax relief for low- and middle-income Americans.  \n\nWhile I support many of the initiatives in the Progressive Caucus budget, I believe we should use the revenue generated by a financial market trading fee and a price on carbon to more directly boost family incomes and assist those struggling to find work. Like Leader Pelosi and others who share many CPC priorities, I differ on some of the details of their policy changes. But most of all I am very grateful to the CPC for their significant contribution in the development of the Democratic Alternative and for their vision – which I share – of a growing economy with more shared prosperity.	10152880916798878

109304033877	Today, it brings me great joy to join with Judy Gross and Senator Patrick Leahy and Senator Jeff Flake to bring my friend Alan Gross home from Cuba after his five years in prison. \n\nThis day would not have been possible without the tireless advocacy of Alan’s wife, Judy, who never gave up. I also want to thank President Obama and his team, including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and National Security Advisor Susan Rice, for their dedication to this effort and to their vision of a new day in the relationship between the United States and Cuba. \n\nI also want to recognize my friend and colleague, Congressman Jim McGovern, for his important role in gaining Alan’s release, and for his persistence in working to open a new chapter in the U.S. – Cuban relationship.	10152637160423878
109304033877	Voting NO on this spending bill. It leaves taxpayers on the hook to pay for gambling at biggest banks and undoes critical campaign finance reforms. We can keep government open without these provisions.	10152623632518878

109304033877	The House may vote on the Farm Bill Conference Report this Wednesday.  On the merits, some Members are planning to oppose the bill while others are planning to support it. However, every Member of Congress should insist on a House Rule that specifies that, in the event the Farm Bill passes, the House will immediately take another vote to use the savings from reducing agriculture subsidies to extend emergency unemployment insurance.\n\nIf the Speaker and House Republicans want to oppose using those savings to help millions of struggling Americans, that is their right. But they should have the decency to allow a vote on this critical lifeline for millions of Americans.	10151982683098878

109304033877	What President Johnson called for 50 years ago today was a War on Poverty. But by slashing food and nutrition support, the Tea Party GOP is waging a War on the Poor.	10151944650118878
109304033877	Glad to see the bipartisan Senate vote to consider extending unemployment insurance. The House should act immediately - it would boost the economy and help millions.	10151943228878878
109304033877	This agreement isn’t perfect, but it is certainly better than no agreement at all. This difficult negotiation has gone through many phases.

148299805224565	Today marks the 45th anniversary of #EarthDay. This year’s theme, “It’s Our Turn to Lead,” reminds us that it’s our time to take bold action to protect our environment. \n\nClimate change is real and it is impacting our lives in significant ways. Major storm events like the ones we experienced here in Massachusetts this past winter are becoming more and more common. \n\nSome cite this cold weather and extreme snow as undeniable proof that the climate isn't changing - that we’ve somehow hit the pause button on global warming. There is no pause button on global warming. If we do not act to control our emissions by decreasing our reliance on fossil fuels and investing in renewable energy and innovative technologies, we will continue to witness weather extremes - from heat waves, to super typhoons to record-breaking snowfall. \n\nIt is time for those who have rejected the science of climate change at the expense of our environment to acknowledge that we cannot wait to tackle this challenge. Our children and grandchildren cannot wait any longer. We must work together to create policies that preserve our environment and incentivize clean, renewable energy technology. \n\nIt’s our turn to act now to protect our planet.	825505220837350

148299805224565	STATEMENT ON THE PRESIDENT’S DRAFT #AUMF\n\nI’m pleased that we are finally discussing a new authorization for military force in the Middle East, something that should have happened a long time ago. Congress has been negligent, ignoring its constitutional duties on matters of war and peace.  I hope that when a resolution comes to the floor, the House will be given the opportunity for a full and fair debate. \n\nFurther, I am troubled by the Administration’s request, which I believe is far too open-ended and does little to constrain this or the next Administration from engaging in sustained combat.  We should be doing much more to promote a legitimate and lasting political solution in the region.  And we should be wary of believing that any Congressional resolution will suddenly cause 50 million people in the Middle East to decide to live peaceably together.	790528564335016

148299805224565	Tonight the President laid out a bold – but achievable – agenda to increase prosperity for all Americans.  \n\nWe continue to see strong economic growth as we recover from the worst recession since the 1930’s.  But too many middle class families – and those trying to get into the middle class – have not fully benefited from that growth.  That has to change.  We especially need to extend ladders of opportunity to those struggling in poverty.  \n\nThe question before us now is whether or not the new Republican Congress will agree to work with Democrats in a meaningful, thoughtful and bipartisan way, or if they will continue to be the “Party of No.”  \n\nI hope for the sake of the country they make the right choice.\n\n#SOTU	781168991937640

308919414191	I want to thank the voters of the Third Congressional District for re-electing me and giving me the privilege of continuing to represent you in Congress.\n\nAnd, I want to thank Ann Wofford for waging a spirited, issues-oriented campaign.\n\nI have always appreciated that this is an independent-minded district and that I can never take any vote for granted. It is why I have made staying in touch with the people I represent one of the hallmarks of my office, and I pledge to continue to keep my door open as an accessible representative to the individuals and families, entrepreneurs, employees and employers at businesses small and large, and local organizations and leaders who are working every day to better our communities.\n\nI also commit to returning to Washington on your behalf to solve the hard problems our country is facing without short-changing middle class families, or putting added burdens on our servicemembers, students or seniors. We need to strengthen our economy so that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to find a good paying job. We need to confront critical issues that are instrumental to improving the lives of America’s middle class families, like affordable education and childcare, equal pay for equal work, raising the minimum wage, providing earned sick leave and more. And we need to encourage policies that support innovation and small businesses that keep jobs on American soil. Right here in the Third District we are home to some of Massachusetts most exciting and forward-thinking companies, from footwear manufacturers to worldwide leaders in the technology sector. If we ‘Make it in America,’ we will put Americans back to work.\n\nI will continue to make working with both Democrats and Republicans to make a real difference in the lives of servicemen and women, military families, and veterans seeking the care and benefits they’ve earned one of my highest priorities as a member of the Armed Services Committee.\n\nThis has always been a campaign of ideas, but it is also a campaign of people. I especially want to thank my dedicated campaign staff and the remarkable volunteers who helped make this victory possible.\n\nI also want to acknowledge my talented and committed Congressional staff both in Washington and here in the district. I know that they will continue to do a superb job working on behalf of this district over the next two years.\n\nI am grateful for all that we have achieved together over the last seven years. And, as I visit all of the communities that make up this remarkable district, I see the hard work, determination, innovation, and perseverance that drive the people that live here. That resilience and hopefulness inspire me every day. What a powerful voice we can have when, in that spirit, we come together and chart a path forward on common ground.\n\nThank you, again, for giving me this strong vote of confidence. Over the next two years, I am committed to meeting our challenges head on and building on our steady progress. I am confident that together we can continue to make a difference.	10152776714349192

151168844937573	I am stunned and heartbroken by the news out of South Carolina this morning. My thoughts and prayers are with those who lost their loved ones as a result of this truly evil act. Whether religiously or racially motivated (or both) this is a hate crime. Regardless of one's faith, all houses of worship should be sanctuaries, where we can let go of our burdens. It is hard to imagine the suspect sitting in church, watching the men, women and children around him lift their voices in prayer, then viciously taking their lives. I hope he is captured quickly before additional lives are placed in jeopardy.	849662155088235
151168844937573	I am deeply troubled by the Administration’s decision to send an additional 450 U.S. military personnel into Iraq. It will bring the number of U.S. troops in Iraq to approximately 3,500, a clear escalation of our role in the region. Although we are being told our personnel will serve in noncombat roles as trainers and advisors, how long are they expected to serve in this capacity?\n \nPresident Obama MUST come to Congress for this creeping escalation. The U.S. is slowly but definitively getting further and further drawn into this conflict and the Administration cannot guarantee that additional troops won’t be ordered. The President has a Constitutional obligation to bring this matter before Congress. If this effort expands into combat, it should be based on a Congressional authorization, not an Executive order.\n \nAlthough I believe the President has an obligation to come before Congress, I do not support this escalation. I have real problems with US troops serving in this capacity without a broad coalition, and that includes troops on the ground from neighboring regional countries. \n \nI am also very concerned by what seems to me to be a half measure of participation. If the U.S. is to deepen its engagement, it should be with an equally strong coalition of partners and a well defined mission. If a military action deserves our support there should be a clear understanding of what winning means and a commitment to achieving it. We have had to learn that lesson too many times, in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq I, Iraq II, Somalia and so many other places. The debate about our role in the Middle East and indeed in the world at large is long overdue. The President has the responsibility to present coherent foreign and defense policies to Congress and engage in that debate with us. I am not at all convinced that more involvement in this troubled region is the most prudent path and I am not prepared to support additional military action.	847149512006166

151168844937573	5/22 – E-UPDATE\nBlack box legislation; Transportation; Appropriations; Tax credits; Science; Space\n\nBlack Box Legislation\n\nThis week I filed the “Black Box Privacy Protection Act” with Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) to give vehicle owners more control over the information collected through their car or motorcycle’s "black box" event data recorder (EDR). The legislation requires manufacturers to notify consumers if an event data recorder is installed in their vehicle, disclose the data collection capabilities, and provide information on how data collected may be used. The bill places ownership of the data in the hands of the vehicle owner and requires the owner’s permission before the information can be accessed.  The legislation also requires manufacturers to give consumers the option of controlling the recording function in future automobiles or motorcycles that are equipped with event data recorders.\n\nEvent data recorders, or "black boxes," are installed in vehicles to collect information leading up to an accident. They record factors such as speed and brake application. Many consumers are not aware that this data has the potential of being used against them in civil or criminal proceedings, or by their insurer to increase rates. No federal law exists to clarify the rights of a vehicle owner with respect to this recorded data. \n\nUnder this legislation, all data collected by an EDR would become the property of the vehicle owner. The bill would make it illegal for anyone other than the vehicle owner to download or retrieve information without owner consent or a court order. It also requires all new cars equipped with EDRs to have an option allowing the owner to control the recording function that cannot be restarted without the owner’s consent. For me this is a basic issue of privacy. Consumers should have control of the information collected in their own vehicles.\n\nTransportation\n \nOn Tuesday the House considered H.R. 2353, a two month Highway Trust Fund extension. The authorization for transportation funding expires at the end of May and H.R. 2353 extends it until July 31st. I supported this legislation so states and municipalities will continue having access to transportation dollars. I am deeply disappointed however, that an extension is once again necessary. Historically, reauthorizing transportation funding has been bipartisan and long term. Every state has infrastructure requiring repair and worthwhile transportation projects in need of federal funding. Transportation spending is also good for the economy because it creates jobs. Yet, time and time again, Republican leadership has settled on a short term extension rather than focus on how to advance legislation that will fund multiple years. Longer agreements give states a measure of certainty over how much money they can expect to receive from the federal government and the ability to set long-term priorities. I hope this is the last extension, and the House can complete work on a multiyear agreement this summer. I voted YES. H.R. 2353 passed.\n \nAppropriations\n \nOn Tuesday the House also considered H.R. 2250, Legislative Branch Appropriations. This bill funds the offices and services related to Congress, such as the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol and member offices. I did not support this legislation due to my overall concern about the continued impact of sequestration. I voted NO. H.R. 2250 passed.\n \nTax Credits\n \nOn Wednesday the House considered H.R. 880, the American Research and Competitiveness Act. This legislation updates and makes permanent the research and development tax credit. While I am concerned that the cost of the tax credit is not offset, it will create jobs and help to encourage additional investment in research. A permanent extension offers a degree of certainty to businesses that often plan their research projects far in advance. They must take into account the time involved with building facilities, conducting experiments and carrying out trials. Federal funding for research and development has declined over the years and making this tax credit permanent is one way to support it. I voted YES. H.R. 880 passed.\n \nScience\n \nAlso on Wednesday the House considered H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015. This legislation authorizes the federal government’s research and Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education programs. Past reauthorizations have enjoyed strong bipartisan support. Unfortunately, H.R. 1806 does little to encourage scientific innovation. Instead, it contains steep funding cuts to a whole host of Department of Energy (DOE) and National Science Foundation (NSF) programs, including those focusing on energy efficiency, renewable energy, social, behavioral, and economic sciences research, and geosciences. This would be the first time Congress imposes specific funding allocations on individual research disciplines, effectively deciding which initiatives are more important than others. I believe these determinations are best left to the NSF. The bill also includes a provision blocking the government from using DOE’s own research on fossil fuels to set future policy and regulations. The Administration has stated that H.R. 1806 will be vetoed. I voted NO. The legislation passed.\n \nSpace\n \nYesterday the House considered H.R. 2262, the SPACE Act of 2015. The legislation makes several changes to the Commercial Space Launch Act (CSLA), passed to promote development of the commercial space launch industry. While this legislation is far from perfect, it contains provisions to improve safety, keep this emerging industry internationally competitive and allow it to continue creating jobs and developing new technology. H.R. 2262 extends the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulatory learning period to 2025, giving the agency time to collect data and begin developing a safety framework for future regulations. It also establishes a legal framework to govern the property rights of resources obtained from asteroids and orders the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to study how to best manage space traffic and mitigate the increasing number of dangerous debris cluttering low-Earth orbit. I voted YES. H.R. 2262 passed.\n \nWhat’s Up Next\n \nA District Work period is scheduled. The next House votes will occur on Monday June 1st.\n\nhttp://capuano.house.gov/e-updates/eu2015-05-22.shtml	836971349690649

151168844937573	3/13 – E-UPDATE\nIran, Green Line Extension; Draper Lab; Brighton Marine; American Jewish Committee\n \nIran\n\nThe news that 47 Republican Senators wrote to Iran’s leader, inserting themselves in the delicate negotiations over nuclear weapons development is simply stunning, even in today’s hyper-partisan environment. I disagreed with President Bush on almost everything but I respected him and his office, and would never have sought to undermine him the way that this letter undermines President Obama.\n\nQuite plainly, the letter that 47 Republican Senators sent is a show of disrespect for the Office of the President of the United States and disregard for the Constitutional separation of powers. To tell Iran’s leader that any agreement negotiators craft essentially means nothing once President Obama leaves office is more than an escalation in tensions between Republicans in the Senate and the White House. It is troubling constitutionally.  Make no mistake; this letter represents more than just misplaced concern over complicated negotiations. It undermines the ability of the President and the Department of State to conduct foreign policy and threatens the President as Commander-in-Chief.  Criticism is legitimate, but this time, 47 Republican critics went too far.\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot this week about history and if there is any precedent for action like this. I recall the end of World War I when, in 1920, Republicans then in the Senate sabotaged United States entry into the League of Nations. This ultimately made it more difficult for the world to thwart aggression by Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and Imperial Japan. Regardless, at least that Republican Senate respected the Office of the President (if not the President himself) and the powers vested in that office by the Constitution. They waited until negotiations were concluded and the Treaty of Versailles was presented to them before they acted.\n\nToday’s Senate Republicans couldn't even give the Obama Administration the courtesy of waiting to see what the deal looks like before trying to derail it.\n\nGreen Line Extension\n \nThe Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, widely recognized as the state's premier public policy organization on fiscal, tax and economic policies, released a report this week on the status of the MBTA: http://www.masstaxpayers.org/sites/masstaxpayers.org/files/MTF_The%20T-The%20End%20of%20Its%20Line.pdf\n \nThis is an organization that tries to avoid partisanship and ideological purity tests which is one of the reasons why they are so widely respected. The report details many suggestions on how to fix the MBTA, and calls for a temporary halt in MBTA expansion.  This argument has been echoed by others, but too many critics do not take into account the progress made on some projects and the impact they will have when completed.\n \nThe Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, however, recognizes that not all projects should be stopped. Here is how they put it in their report: “Before the MBTA undertakes any further expansion (with the exception of the Green Line Extension), it must get its current fiscal house in order.” I fully agree – the Green Line Extension needs to move forward.\n \nDraper Lab\n \nI met this week with the new President of Draper Lab in Cambridge. We talked at length about the vital role that Draper has played in defense related research and in solidifying Cambridge’s relevance as a high technology and research magnet. New President Ken Gabriel shared with me his goal of expanding Draper Lab’s research into more civilian applications. I’ve met with Draper officials over the years, and have had the opportunity to visit the facilities. I always enjoy learning about their latest research.\n \nBrighton Marine\n \nI met with officials from the Brighton Marine Health Center (BMHC).   The center is planning a campus renovation and they shared some of those details with me. We also spoke at length about potential changes to the military’s TRICARE Prime, called the US Family Health Plan. These changes could impact both BMHC and plan participants. BMHC is the only location in Massachusetts and Southern New England that provides services under this plan.  TRICARE is a health plan for uniformed services personnel and their dependents. It is also available for qualified retired uniformed services personnel and their dependents. Many families rely on TRICARE and BMHC is making sure that they are fully informed as plan changes are considered. I thanked them for keeping me updated on what the changes could mean for families locally.\n \nAmerican Jewish Committee\n \nI met with recently with constituents from the American Jewish Committee.   We discussed several troubling issues, and I was impressed by their realism. They were concerned, as I am, about the prospect of a nuclear armed Iran. Like me, they would like to give negotiations a chance to succeed.  They expressed a degree of skepticism about Iran’s trustworthiness. I told them I would not take military force off the table but felt that talk of military action was premature.   We also talked about the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism in Western Europe and about efforts to depict Israel as an “apartheid” state on some US campuses.   I reiterated my opposition to “boycott, sanctions, and divestment” campaigns against Israel and recalled the successful effort to defeat a divestment referendum in Somerville.\n \nWhat’s Up Next\n \nThe next House votes are scheduled for Monday March 16th. At this writing, a floor schedule is not available.	806462952741489

151168844937573	1/16 E-UPDATE\nCollege ratings; Focus on regulation; Financial Services; Homeland Security\n\nJanuary 16, 2015\n \nCollege Ratings\n \nThis week I re-introduced a resolution with my Republican colleague, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), opposing the President’s plan to establish a college ratings system. The Administration first proposed such a system over a year ago and in December unveiled a draft framework. The ratings would be based on criteria such as the percentage of students receiving degrees and the average salaries of graduates. Given the diversity of our higher education system in everything from size to academic offerings and specialties, I think it will be extremely difficult to craft a one size fits all ratings system that can accurately determine a school’s value. While I do appreciate the Administration’s commitment to making higher education more accessible and affordable, establishing a system to rate schools using imperfect criteria that cannot be accurately measured or equally applied is not the answer. I am especially concerned about using this ratings system to determine financial aid, which could unfairly burden students and further reduce their access to higher education. I will be working with Rep. Goodlatte to build support for our resolution.\n\nA Focus on Regulation\n \nOn Tuesday the House considered H.R. 185, the Regulatory Accountability Act. This legislation is described by supporters as an effort to reduce regulatory burdens when in reality it does the exact opposite. H.R. 185 adds dozens of new regulatory requirements across numerous agencies. It significantly expands the scope of the cost-benefit analysis required on all administrative rulemaking and applies that cost-benefit analysis to every single rule, not just those with economic significance. H.R. 185 would apply cost-benefit analysis requirements to more than 3,000 rules every year. You can imagine how much more this will cost taxpayers. The Administration has stated that the President will veto this bill. I voted NO. H.R. 185 passed the House.\n \nFinancial Services\n \nOn Wednesday the House again considered H.R. 37, the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. You may recall that this bill was brought up last week under suspension of the rules which requires a 2/3 majority to pass. It didn’t receive that much support so it was brought up this week under regular order. This legislation is a combination of 11 different bills considered previously, some of which have actually passed with bipartisan support. However, H.R. 37 still contains some troubling provisions, including the provision delaying implementation of part of the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits banks from using its depositors’ funds to make risky investments. H.R. 37 gives banks two more years to divest from Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs). This is on top of the two extra years federal regulators have already granted banks to divest from non-conforming CLOs, which are risky investments that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently investigating. The SEC is determining how these instruments are used and traded and whether they are creating new avenues for fraud. The SEC is also reviewing whether banks and companies are using complicated bond deals to hide certain risks illegally. It’s worth noting that only three of Wall Street’s largest banks control almost 70% of CLO transactions. I again voted NO. It passed the House.\n \nHomeland Security\n \nLast month Congress passed legislation funding the federal government through the end of the current fiscal year with the exception of Homeland Security Appropriations. Those programs were only funded through the end of February to give the new Congress the opportunity to take legislative action opposing the President’s executive orders on immigration. The President acted because House Republican leadership has refused for years to consider comprehensive immigration reform or even to allow a vote on a bipartisan Senate passed bill. On Wednesday the House added several amendments to H.R. 240, Homeland Security Appropriations. They prohibit the use of funds to enforce the executive actions that the President took to set immigration enforcement priorities and expand opportunities for DREAMers – young people who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents, many as infants. Rather than proactively proposing their own ideas on how to reform our immigration system, House Republicans are instead working to stop the President from exercising his own authority to act by cutting off funding. I voted NO. H.R. 240 passed the House.\n \nWhat’s Up Next\n \nNext votes will take place on Tuesday January 20th. President Obama will deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening.\n\nhttp://capuano.house.gov/e-updates/eu2015-01-16.shtml	782329665154818

151168844937573	1/9 – E-UPDATE\nTerrorism; 114th Congress;Green Line Extension; FHA; TRIA; Financial Services; ACA; Keystone XL\n\nJanuary 9, 2015\n \nTerrorism\n \nI grieve with the family and friends of those who were brutally murdered this week in France.  First, 8 journalists were killed at a satirical magazine. Two police officers, guarding the paper’s staff after a firebombing in 2011, died in the same attack. Men were killed, it appears, because they published cartoons some felt disrespectful of religion or defended their right to do so. Freedom of conscience creates responsibilities: citizens must tolerate dissent and express disagreements peacefully. Today we learned that hostages were taken at a kosher market in Paris by a man who boasted of having previously killed an unarmed policewoman. At least 4 of the hostages perished. These attacks are assaults on the principles that support all democratic governments. \n\nThe 114th Congress\n \nOn Tuesday the 114th Congress was sworn in. As you will learn by reading today’s newsletter, not much has changed in the House. Nevertheless, I am energized about continuing to represent the 7th Congressional District and truly appreciate the opportunity. Thanks for your interest in this newsletter and all the feedback we received last year. I hope you will continue sharing your thoughts and expressing your opinions.\n \nGreen Line Extension\n \nBefore I get to this week’s legislative activity, I have some good news to share. On Monday the Federal Transit Administration made its nearly $1 billion commitment to the Green Line Extension official by signing the Full Funding Grant Agreement with the Commonwealth. This commits the federal government to fully funding its share of the Green Line Extension, something I’ve been working on for years. I was very pleased to celebrate the signing of this agreement Monday with the local, state and federal stakeholders who have been great advocates with me on this initiative.\n \nFederal Housing Administration\n \nThis week the Obama Administration announced that it was reducing the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance premium effective January 26th. This will make homeownership more affordable for those seeking to enter the housing market. These premiums have been steadily increasing and I have long advocated a return to more affordable levels which will help make this program more accessible to moderate-income families. I wrote to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) several times last year, along with Rep. Maxine Waters, to request that the FHA take another look at its policies regarding the mortgage insurance premium. Because that premium was steadily increasing, it was putting FHA mortgages out of reach for many otherwise qualified home buyers. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) is stable. This sensible reduction to the upfront mortgage insurance premium will better accommodate the homebuyers it is designed to serve.\n \nTRIA\n \nOn Wednesday the House considered legislation to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.  The bill considered, H.R. 26, was the same one that the House passed last month. It extends TRIA for six years and increases the amount of losses that would make insurance companies eligible to access TRIA from $100 million to $200 million over five years. TRIA was passed in the aftermath of 9/11 after terrorism insurance suddenly became unaffordable and limited. The high cost of terrorism insurance stymied activity in many industries, affecting workers compensation coverage and halting new construction. TRIA created a federal backstop to help make terrorism insurance available and affordable again. The measure has twice been extended but it expired at the end of 2014.\n \nI have introduced legislation on TRIA starting in 2004. Most recently I worked with my Republican colleague, Rep. Peter King, in advance of the program’s 2014 expiration. Unfortunately, the Senate did not act on the House bill and TRIA was not renewed. The House took steps this week to restart the program. The legislation still includes some changes to the Dodd-Frank Act having to do with non-financial swap transactions. While I do not think this legislation should be the vehicle that House Republicans use to amend Dodd Frank, a relatively noncontroversial change should not jeopardize restarting TRIA. The Senate also acted this week so the TRIA reauthorization is on its way to the President. I voted YES. H.R. 26 passed.\n \nMore Financial Services\n \nOn Wednesday the House also considered H.R. 37, the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. This legislation, introduced on Tuesday, is a combination of 11 different bills that were considered in the last Congress. Most of the provisions are noncontroversial and have actually passed with bipartisan support when voted on separately. However, H.R. 37 contains a very troubling provision that delays the implementation of part of the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits banks from using its depositors’ funds to make risky investments. H.R. 37 gives banks two more years to divest from Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs). This is on top of the two extra years that federal regulators have already granted banks to divest from non-conforming CLOs, which are risky investments that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently investigating. The SEC is determining how these instruments are used and traded and whether they are creating new avenues for fraud. The SEC is also reviewing whether banks and companies are using complicated bond deals to hide certain risks illegally. It’s worth noting that only three of Wall Street’s largest banks control almost 70% of CLO transactions. I spoke on the House floor against H.R. 37 and you can view my speech here. Because H.R. 37 did not go through regular order, it required a 2/3 affirmative vote in order to pass. It did not achieve that threshold so it did not pass in the House. I voted NO.\n\nMore Votes on the ACA\n \nOn Thursday the House considered H.R. 30, the Save American Workers Act of 2015. With this legislation, the Republican-led House is picking up where it left off when it comes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  H.R. 30 is the 54th time that the House has voted to repeal or alter the ACA. None of these efforts have resulted in a change to the law. H.R. 30 alters a provision in the ACA requiring employers to offer their employees working 30 hours or more a week health care or pay a penalty. H.R. 30 raises that threshold to 40 hours. This change places many more people at risk of losing their employer health care. Employers could simply reduce their workers’ hours slightly, freeing employers from the requirement of offering health coverage. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), this would increase the federal budget deficit by $53 billion over the next ten years. The CBO also estimates that a million workers could lose their health care coverage. Republicans argue that this change is necessary because the number of part-time workers has increased since the ACA became law. In fact, the exact opposite has occurred. I voted NO. H.R. 30 passed.\n\nKeystone XL\n \nToday the House considered H.R. 3, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. This is basically the same legislation that the House voted on in November. The Keystone XL Pipeline would carry crude oil over the Canadian border through parts of the United States to the Gulf Coast. Because of the nature of the project, and because it will cross an international border, there is a required approval process. I don’t think there is any question that a project like this one should be subject to a significant environmental review, including under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). H.R.3 basically exempts the pipeline from all of this. The review process is ongoing and there is no reason to stop it. This legislation also sets a troubling precedent by allowing the project to bypass required reviews, creating a similar path for other projects. I voted NO. H.R. 3 passed.\n \nWhat’s up Next\n \nNext votes will take place on Monday January 12th. The House is expected to again consider H.R. 37, the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. This time the legislation will come up under regular order, so it will need a simple majority to pass.\n\nhttp://capuano.house.gov/e-updates/eu2015-01-09.shtml	779560602098391
151168844937573	I commend President Obama for reducing FHA mortgage insurance premiums, which will make homeownership more affordable for those seeking to enter the housing market.

151168844937573	I grieve today with the family and friends of those who were brutally murdered in a French newspaper office. Two of the dead were police officers, assigned to defend the paper’s staff after a firebombing in 2011. I join with liberty-loving people everywhere in condemning this monstrous attack on free speech. Four men were killed, it appears, because they drew cartoons some felt disrespectful of religion. Freedom of conscience creates responsibilities:  citizens must  tolerate dissent and  express disagreements peacefully. This attack is an assault on principles that support all democratic governments.	778746625513122

151168844937573	12/22 – E-UPDATE\nTransportation; Public-private partnerships; Boston Harbor; Social Security Numbers; Jobs; Redevelopment; Monuments Men; National Housing Trust Fund; Family Self-Sufficiency Project; Constituent services; Looking ahead\n\nDecember 22, 2014\n \nDear Friends,\n \nI hope you are having a wonderful holiday season with the opportunity to spend some time with family and friends. As 2014 draws to a close I wanted to reflect on some of the work we have done over the last twelve months and look ahead to the New Year.\n \nTransportation\n \nI am pleased to report some significant progress on several transportation initiatives. The Green Line Extension (GLX), which I have been advocating for since my time as Mayor of Somerville, was approved for a $1 billion federal investment when the Federal Transit Administration announced its intent to enter into a Full Funding Grant Agreement with Massachusetts. This marks a major milestone for the GLX.\n \nIn September the new Assembly Square Orange Line T stop opened to the public, the first new MBTA station in three decades. When I worked almost ten years ago to secure federal funding for this T stop, Assembly Square was still under development. Now it is a thriving urban neighborhood with retail, residential, employment and entertainment opportunities. If you haven’t been to Assembly Square in a while, you should come check it out.\n \nAlso in September, we learned from the Department of Transportation (DOT) that the MBTA was awarded a TIGER grant to revitalize Boston’s Ruggles Station. This is a very competitive program. The DOT received $9.5 billion in grant applications, which was more than 15 times the amount of federal money available for this round of TIGER grants. With the Green Line Extension, the new Orange Line T stop and the improvements being made to Ruggles Station, Greater Boston’s public transportation network received some significant federal support in 2014.\n \nPublic Private Partnerships\n \nI had the chance in 2014 to delve deeper into some key transportation policy questions through my role as Ranking Member of the Committee on Transportation’s Special Panel on Public Private Partnerships. While on the special panel, I focused on how to best invest limited federal transportation dollars and the role Public Private Partnerships can play in stretching those dollars. I enjoyed this panel, in particular the opportunity to work closely with Members on the other side of the aisle. I am particularly proud that the panel released a bipartisan report during a time when partisanship seems especially bitter in Washington. It gives me hope that there are areas of policy where Democrats and Republicans can find common ground. This special panel certainly didn’t agree on everything, but we worked together to prepare a series of recommendations that took into account the often differing views of all our members.\n \nBoston Harbor\n \n I recently gathered with local, state and federal stakeholders to celebrate a $310 million federal authorization for the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the Boston Harbor. This work will deepen the harbor’s navigation channels so that it can accommodate newer, larger ships. The economic benefit of completing this dredging is significant, creating jobs and stimulating additional activity.  \n \nSocial Security Numbers\n \nYou may recall that I filed legislation to prohibit the Social Security numbers of deceased individuals from being made publicly available through the Federal government’s Death Master File (DMF). Easy access to this file has contributed to tax related identity theft. I was pleased that a provision limiting access to the DMF was included in the December 2013 budget agreement.\n \nJobs\n \nSaving and creating jobs whenever possible should be a priority for Congress. My colleagues and I were able to secure funding to save more than 100 jobs at MIT’s fusion lab in January. The money was going to be taken away from the university and instead directed to fusion programs overseas. This was very troubling to us for a number of reasons. Not only did it mean the elimination of good jobs in Cambridge, it also could have caused the United States to fall behind on important scientific research. We were pleased when the Administration finally agreed to keep those jobs in Massachusetts.\n \nRedevelopment\n \nAlso in Cambridge, the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center became the focus of future redevelopment opportunities. I have long worked on this issue because there is so much interest in that land, one of the last underdeveloped parcels in Kendall Square. My main focus has been on ensuring that Volpe’s employees and other stakeholders have a voice in the process and are not displaced by private development. In August, the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a Request for Information to gather ideas for redevelopment of that parcel, including construction of a space that can accommodate the current workforce within the existing footprint.\n \nThe Monuments Men\n \nThis year, H.R. 3658, the Monuments Men Recognition Act, passed by voice vote. I was the lead Democratic sponsor of the bill, and honored to be part of bringing this long overdue recognition to the men and women who served as the “Monuments Men” during World War II.  The legislation awards them with the Congressional Gold Medal. These brave soldiers struggled, often behind enemy lines, to locate and preserve some of the world’s most precious artifacts. Without thought for their own safety, they helped save from destruction cathedrals, sculptures and other works of art.\n \nNational Housing Trust Fund\n \nLate in 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced it would allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to begin making contributions to the National Housing Trust Fund, an action I have been working on for years. Congress established the fund in 2008 to help construct and preserve affordable housing all over the country. The need for affordable rental housing and job and business investment has only grown since the Great Recession. I am pleased to report that the FHFA acted on our request this year.\n \nFamily Self Sufficiency Program\n \nCongress this year expanded the Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program for families who utilize Section 8 Project Based Rental Assistance (PBRA). I worked with my colleague, Rep. Waters, to increase access to this program, at no additional cost to taxpayers. The FSS program allows families to pursue educational opportunities, job training and other economic stability initiatives. Families who use PBRA could not access this program. At our request, the program was expanded to allow property managers to seek private funding or use surplus resources to develop FSS programming.\n \nConstituent Services\n \nMy staff devotes much time and effort to constituent service.  Legislative gridlock does not affect the good relationships we have with federal agencies and US Embassies abroad.  Many times we have been able to help constituents by explaining the emergencies they face and getting the quick action they need.  While we cannot share the specifics of individual cases because of privacy reasons, we can give you an idea of some of the types of cases we encounter every day.\n \nI am privileged to represent great universities, research institutes, and teaching hospitals. We are often asked to expedite work authorization for brilliantly gifted young people who would otherwise be forced to leave the United States and continue their research or launch their start-ups overseas.\n \nWe also work with hospitals on compassionate cases, such as helping with visas for potential organ donors or relatives of the terminally ill.  This summer, a mother who had not seen her son in 13 years arrived in time to be with him during his last two hours of consciousness.\n \nSometimes, we help coordinate essential efforts. Recently, a young woman, brutalized in an arranged marriage, gave birth to a seriously ill child.  She arrived in Boston with a proper visa because an American embassy recognized the dangers they faced.  A faith-based organization, a pro bono lawyer, a family court judge, the US Citizenship and Immigration Service, MassHealth, and a great hospital did all they could.  The baby did not survive, but the grieving mother knows she is not alone.  Many Americans helped her and will support her claim for political asylum.\nWe expedited a passport for a disabled veteran who is a naturalized citizen, so he could be his brother’s best man and expedited naturalization for a young man so he could qualify for ROTC.\n \nWe regularly help constituents navigate federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration (SSA). We recently helped a woman who had been trying to get her case resolved for months, in person and through numerous phone calls. We worked with her and the SSA, and I am pleased to report a satisfactory resolution.\n \nLooking Ahead\n \nWhile I am happy to report on some of the successes that we have had this year, many issues will still require attention in the 114th Congress. Comprehensive Immigration Reform did not advance and I am hopeful that Congress will find common ground. I will continue advocating for my legislation, The Best Return on America’s Investment Now Act (BRAIN), which will encourage highly educated foreign students to remain in the United States. The bill amends the Employment Based Visa (EB) program to create a new category drawn from the current visa limit for persons who have earned Doctorate Degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). Not enough Americans seek enough of these degrees to satisfy our national needs and we should want to keep these graduates here to help expand our economy. While I am hopeful that an initiative like this will be part of CIR, I will refile my legislation in 2015.\n \nThe emergence of new technologies should prompt all of us to think about what the latest innovations in cell phones or other devices mean for our privacy. I filed several pieces of legislation aimed at regulating data collection and protecting privacy. The We Are Watching You Act was filed in response to reports that companies were developing new DVR technology that could record people in their homes as they watch television. The Black Box Privacy Protection Act would ensure that all the data collected by a vehicle owner’s event data recorder (EDR) or “black box” is the property of that owner and could not be accessed without a court order. The Reasonable Policies on Automated License Plate Readers Act seeks to establish privacy protections for the information obtained through automatic license plate readers. It is long past time to have a real discussion about just how much data we are giving up in exchange for the latest technology and how much data our government should be able to collect and store about us. In the weeks ahead I will be reviewing these bills with the intent of refiling them after updates to account for recent advances in technology that may pose new risks.\n \nI am sorry to say that Sudan and South Sudan will still need our attention in 2015. December 15th marked one year since the beginning of the South Sudan conflict. Millions of South Sudanese have been forced from their homes and thousands killed since fighting erupted in the newly independent nation. The Congressional Caucus on Sudan and South Sudan recently wrote the President, asking him to increase diplomatic efforts to end this brutal conflict before more civilians suffer and the region is further destabilized.\n \nWhile the House voted to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) for six years earlier this month, the Senate did not act before adjourning. TRIA was created in the aftermath of 9/11 after terrorism insurance suddenly became unaffordable and limited. Its high cost stymied activity in many industries, affecting workers compensation coverage and halting new construction. TRIA created a federal backstop to help make terrorism insurance available and affordable again. The measure has twice been extended. I have introduced legislation on TRIA starting in 2004, most recently with my Republican colleague, Rep. Peter King, in advance of this year’s program expiration. Because the Senate did not act, TRIA will expire on December 31st, so we will refocus our efforts in the New Year.\n \nI will continue working on campaign finance issues, including legislation in response to the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC, which fundamentally rewrote the nation’s campaign finance laws.\n \nI am energized for the new Congress and looking forward to working on your behalf with returning colleagues and new members. I thank you for your support of this newsletter and all the feedback we received this year. Please keep it coming and I wish you a Happy Holiday Season.\n\nhttp://capuano.house.gov/e-updates/eu2014-12-22.shtml	768486309872487

151168844937573	My heart is heavy today and my thoughts are with Mayor Menino’s family during this very difficult time. Mayor Menino left an outsized mark on the City of Boston; his legacy is evident in every neighborhood and in every corner of the city he loved so much. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to get to know him and to serve with him – first as colleagues at the State House, then as fellow Mayors, and finally as his Congressman.  My wife and I extend our deepest condolences to Angela, as well as the mayor’s children and grandchildren.	743458139041971
151168844937573	Here is the text of an email I just sent out to my E-Update subscribers:\n\nOn Friday I shared my thoughts with you on the Obama Administration’s developing plan to destroy ISIS and my concerns over arming the Syrian rebels immediately.\n\nThe House tomorrow will vote on a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government beyond September 30th. As part of that legislation, the House will also consider an amendment to provide funds to arm some Syrian rebels with certain conditions imposed. Here is the text of the amendment if you would like more detail. http://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/MCKEON021915141612381238.pdf\n\n Over the past few days my staff and I have attended numerous meetings, asking questions and gathering information. I wrote last week that I remain skeptical about arming the rebels but I am open to listening. I have approached all of the briefings this week with that perspective; I am keeping an open mind and am working to fully understand all aspects of current circumstances as well as strategies to address them.\n\n Based on what I have read and heard, my opinion remains the same. I believe that the President should continue the air campaign against ISIS in order to protect our interests and allies. The Administration should continue building an international coalition; and the strategy should be refined as more information becomes available and as circumstances change on the ground.  Today, America does not yet have enough reliable allies willing to shoulder enough of the burden in this effort.  Today, we have not vetted any faction within the Syrian opposition enough to trust them. Let’s not forget, a year ago, many ISIS fighters would have been trained by the U.S. as part of a “trusted” force. \n\n At this time, I cannot support this amendment. If the strategy is clarified and international partners make firm and explicit commitments to participate, Congress can and should be called back into session immediately for further discussion and a vote on the matter. The House should not rush to judgment in such a complicated region until there is more certainty surrounding our alliances and the goals of any mission. \n\nEqually important, this issue should not be an amendment to a Continuing Resolution necessary to keep the federal government running until after the election.  These are separate and distinct issues and each is important enough to be voted on separately. Absent additional information, I will vote NO on the amendment.	723179091069876

183092598372008	Today, the world is united in celebrating Earth Day and the progress the international community has made in promoting clean air and water protections and investing in renewable energy initiatives while combating greenhouse gas emissions. Nowhere is this progress more evident – or necessary -  than in our district, where it complements our everyday life. From the dunes of the Cape Cod National Seashore to the waters of Buzzards Bay, our district is intricately linked with the environment, and it is critical that we protect these treasures for years to come. #EarthDay2015	1047436375270955
183092598372008	Today, the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, on which I am the Ranking Member, held a hearing on how illicit wildlife trafficking not only threatens endangered species but also finances international terrorist activities.  This serious global crime, which has more than doubled since 2007 and is currently the fourth largest global illegal activity, has significant negative impacts for endangered species protection, ecosystem stability, and biodiversity conservation.  It is also a real and increasing threat to our national security.  Much of the global illegal trade in wildlife is run by transnational criminal and terrorist organizations, which are attracted to wildlife trafficking because of its low risk of detection, high profits, and weak penalties.  As we commemorate Earth Day today, we must continue this fight against wildlife trafficking.	1047427015271891

183092598372008	Great to join Congresswoman Clark, Laura Washington and Dr. Henry Vaillancourt of Fall River at the National RX Drug Abuse Summit in Atlanta to discuss the ongoing work to end prescription drug abuse. The rate of prescriptions being written and subsequent overdoses in Massachusetts – nearly two people a day dying – is both startling and sobering.  And prescription opioid abuse – both accidental and intentional – results in $72 billion in health care related costs annually.  This is the new War on Drugs and tackling this issue needs to be a priority for our government and community leaders.	1038988129449113

173604349345646	This afternoon, I sent the following letter to my colleagues in the House of Representatives:\n\nStop Spying on U.S. Citizens: Vote “NO” on H.R. 2596\n \nDear Colleague:\n \nThis afternoon, the House will consider the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) for Fiscal Year 2016, which fails to address an expansive new authority recently granted to the intelligence community with virtually zero scrutiny or debate.\n \nLast year, House and Senate leadership used the IAA to rush through a provision that permits the government to acquire, retain, and disseminate nonpublic telephone or electronic communications (i.e., content) of United States persons without the consent of the person or proper legal process. The section contemplates that those private communications of Americans, obtained without a court order, may be transferred to domestic law enforcement for criminal investigations.\n\nThe administration has historically conducted such surveillance under a claim of executive authority, such as E.O. 12333. However, Congress has never before approved using executive authority in that way to capture and use Americans’ private telephone records, electronic communications, or cloud data.\n \nThis provision received little media attention because of the unusual way in which it was adopted. On Monday, I spoke to the Rules Committee about my amendment to strike this provision from law. The committee ruled my amendment out of order without explanation.\n \nHere’s the timeline for how this provision came to be adopted: At 8:50 p.m. on December 9, 2014, the Senate passed a substitute amendment to H.R. 4681, the  IAA for Fiscal Year 2015, which included a new provision (Section 309) that was not part of the original bill that moved through the House several months earlier. The Senate adopted the substitute amendment by unanimous consent and passed the bill by voice vote at 8:51 p.m. At 1:13 p.m. on December 10 (the next day), then-Chairman Mike Rogers attempted to suspend the rules and agree to the Senate amendment by voice vote—passing into law a provision virtually no one knew about and that had thus far received no real vote or been subject to any real debate. I rushed to the floor to demand the yeas and nays. Less than four hours later, the House voted on the measure with most members still unaware of this provision.\n  \nAs noted above, I offered an amendment to the current IAA to strike from law the words, "and shall permit the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of covered communications subject to the limitation in subparagraph (B)". The intelligence committees and intelligence community have claimed that this provision does nothing. If that’s the case, then my amendment should be uncontroversial. Nonetheless, the Rules Committee rejected my amendment.\n \nCongress and the American people deserve real substantive debate on these important issues, and we should reject reauthorization of surveillance authorities until our Fourth Amendment concerns are addressed. I urge you to join me in voting “no” on H.R. 2596, the IAA for Fiscal Year 2016, when it comes before the House today.\n \nSincerely,\n \n/s/\n\nJustin Amash\nMember of Congress	908752229164184

173604349345646	This morning, Rep. John Lewis and I, joined by 58 of our House colleagues, sent the following (and attached) letter to the Senate urging stronger surveillance reforms to protect privacy.\n\nDear Senators:\n \nOn May 13, 2015, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 (H.R. 2048) passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 338 to 88. We, the undersigned representatives, opposed the measure because its reforms do not adequately or appropriately reform surveillance practices or address privacy concerns. Many of our colleagues felt similarly, supporting the bill only out of concern the Senate would be unwilling to engage in more comprehensive reform.\n \nThe American people deserve congressional action that secures their constitutional rights. While we recognize the government's legitimate interests in certain surveillance activities intended to protect the United States, these intrusions must be carefully limited and overseen in order to avoid encroaching upon the freedoms they are intended to preserve. The recent decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit declaring the government's interpretation of "relevant" unlawful underscores that Congress must do more. We urge you to join us in ensuring the federal government’s surveillance practices comport with the U.S. Constitution, are conducted under effective congressional oversight, and are limited to efforts proven effective at safeguarding our country.\n \nCongress has had ample time for debate. We must not kick the can down the road with a short-term reauthorization. Nor will we acquiesce to any effort to weaken this legislation. Indeed, there is strong support for real reform in this chamber, and we hope you will work with us to improve the legislation, such as by incorporating the reforms contained in the original USA FREEDOM Act of 2013, which was cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 152 representatives in the House, and the reforms embodied in the Massie-Lofgren amendment, which was overwhelmingly adopted by the House last year.\n \nWe look forward to working together to better protect the rights of all Americans.\n \nSincerely,\n \nJustin Amash (R-MI)\nJohn Lewis (D-GA)\nThomas Massie (R-KY)\nJared Polis (D-CO)\nTom McClintock (R-CA)\nRaúl Labrador (R-ID)\nJim Jordan (R-OH)\nPaul Gosar (R-AZ)\nTim Huelskamp (R-KS)\nJeff Duncan (R-SC)\nLloyd Doggett (D-TX)\nDiana DeGette (D-CO)\nPeter DeFazio (D-OR)\nMark Sanford (R-SC)\nAndy Harris (R-MD)\nTed Poe (R-TX)\nDave Brat (R-VA)\nEarl Blumenauer (D-OR)\nMark Pocan (D-WI)\nKeith Ellison (D-MN)\nWalter Jones (R-NC)\nScott Garrett (R-NJ)\nScott DesJarlais (R-TN)\nJohn Duncan (R-TN)\nAlcee Hastings (D-FL)\nRod Blum (R-IA)\nTed Lieu (D-CA)\nJim McGovern (D-MA)\nMick Mulvaney (R-SC)\nRichard Nugent (R-FL)\nAlan Lowenthal (D-CA)\nBill Posey (R-FL)\nChellie Pingree (D-ME)\nJohn Fleming (R-LA)\nMark Meadows (R-NC)\nMichael Honda (D-CA)\nDonna F.

173604349345646	You will read all sorts of stories and headlines about how the latest USA FREEDOM Act ends "bulk" collection. It doesn't. In fact, the bill expressly authorizes, for the first time, the NSA, FBI, and other government agencies to unconstitutionally collect data in bulk on potentially millions of law-abiding Americans.\n\nHere's my full statement from Wednesday on why I voted no on the USA FREEDOM Act:\n\nLast week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the bulk telephone metadata program run by the National Security Agency (NSA) is not authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act and is thus unlawful. The ruling is a big win for privacy and civil liberties advocates who have long argued that Section 215 clearly does not contemplate the type of mass collection we now know is occurring. But the win will be short-lived if H.R. 2048, the latest version of the USA FREEDOM Act that’s scheduled to be considered by the House of Representatives this afternoon, becomes law.\n\nSection 215 authorizes the government to collect records and other “tangible things” that are "relevant" to a terrorism or foreign intelligence investigation. To support the bulk collection of data pertaining to millions of law-abiding Americans, the government has effectively claimed that all records everywhere are potentially relevant to a current or future investigation, and thus all records are fair game for collection. In its ruling, the Second Circuit had little choice but to reject the government's broad interpretation of "relevant," given that the rest of the statute gives no indication Congress ever contemplated collection on such a mass scale.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nBut H.R. 2048 threatens to undo much of the progress resulting from the Second Circuit’s opinion. The bill's sponsors, and unfortunately some outside advocacy groups, wrongly claim that H.R. 2048 ends "bulk" collection. It's true that the bill ends the phone dragnet as we currently know it—by having the phone companies themselves hold, search, and analyze certain data at the request of the government, which is worse in many ways given the broader set of data the companies hold—but H.R. 2048 actually expands the statutory basis for the large-scale collection of most data.\n\nH.R. 2048 does this by authorizing the government to order the production of records based upon a “specific selection term” (i.e., like a search term used in a search engine). The records sought still must be relevant to an investigation, so it’s possible the court’s ruling will continue to restrain the government in some fashion. But it’s more likely a court looking at H.R. 2048’s language will see the “specific selection term” as defining the outer limits of what Congress considers acceptably “relevant” under Section 215.\n\nIndeed, the Second Circuit encouraged Congress in reforming Section 215 to make a “congressional judgment as to what is ‘reasonable’ under current circumstances.” Unfortunately, “specific selection term” is defined so broadly under the bill as to have little effect on narrowing the scope of items the government may obtain through a 215 order.\n\nA “specific selection term” may be a specific person (including a corporation, such as Western Union), account, address, or personal device, but it also may be “any other specific identifier,” and the bill expressly contemplates using geographic regions or communication service providers (such as Verizon) to define the records sought, so long as it's not the only identifier used as part of the specific selection term. In other words, the bill doesn't let the government require Verizon to turn over all its records without limitation, but nothing appears to prevent the government from requiring Verizon to turn over all its records for all its customers in the state of New York. Only a politician or bureaucrat wouldn't call that "bulk."\n\nH.R. 2048 gives our intelligence agencies, for the first time, statutory authority to collect Americans’ data in bulk. In light of the Second Circuit’s opinion that the NSA has been collecting our information in bulk without statutory authority for all this time, it would be a devastating misstep for Congress to pass a bill that codifies that bulk collection and likely ensures no future court will ever again be positioned to rule against the government for over-collecting on statutory grounds.\n\nH.R. 2048 falls woefully short of reining in the mass collection of Americans’ data, and it takes us a step in the wrong direction by specifically authorizing such collection in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Americans, and members of Congress, should demand that Congress instead pass the original, bipartisan version of the USA FREEDOM Act from 2013, which strengthened—not weakened—Section 215’s relevance standard to end bulk collection, while still allowing the government the flexibility it needs to pursue genuine threats against the United States.	892001470839260

173604349345646	From day one following the revelation of the NSA's bulk collection program, I have said that the warrantless collection of records on all Americans violates both the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and the plain reading of Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Today's Second Circuit ruling makes clear that the executive branch's interpretation of the statute—interpreting records "relevant" to a terrorism investigation to mean all records everywhere—is "unprecedented and unwarranted." In light of this ruling, Congress must not proceed with the latest version of the USA Freedom Act. While limiting certain types of bulk collection, the latest USA Freedom Act would authorize bulk collection of Americans' records for the first time, thereby undoing some of the progress resulting from the Second Circuit's decision. Instead, Congress should pass, and the president should sign, the original USA Freedom Act, as introduced in 2013 before amendments, that protects the liberty and privacy of all Americans while providing the intelligence community the authority necessary to deal with those who seek to harm us.	889415044431236

173604349345646	The House is poised to set a shocking precedent of more spending, more debt, and higher taxes this evening.\n\nThere are two main competing budgets on the House floor: one from the Budget Committee and one supported by the Armed Services Committee.\n\nCompared to last year's budget, the Budget Committee's budget includes $20 billion in additional "emergency" military spending that's off-budget. This extra military spending isn't counted toward the spending caps set in the 2011 fiscal deal that has modestly reined in spending over the last four years. The Budget Committee's budget says that the new "emergency" spending should be offset by cuts to other programs.\n\nThe Armed Services Committee's budget raises "emergency" military spending by $22 billion, but unlike the Budget Committee's budget, this budget eliminates the spending offsets. It doesn't ask for any cuts to other programs. The Armed Services Committee's budget lays the foundation for more spending from both parties, hundreds of billions of dollars of new debt, and tax hikes.\n\nIf the House passes the Armed Services Committee's budget tonight, we'll have set the dangerous precedent that violating the 2011 budget deal and sequester are acceptable, that more national debt is just fine. We'll have joined with Pres. Obama in obliterating even the pretense of fiscal responsibility.\n\nThe votes on the Budget Committee's budget (known as "Price #1") and the Armed Services Committee's budget (known as "Price #2") will happen around 5 p.m. I will vote yes on Price #1 and no on Price #2.\n\nHow will your representative in Congress vote?	868697483169659

173604349345646	I voted yes on #HR4, Jobs for America Act. The bill combines 15 bills that previously passed the House. It requires federal agencies to provide more information about the costs of unfunded mandates and advanced public notice of proposed regulations, requires the approval of Congress for regulations with annual compliance costs of more than $100 million, and expedites approval of mining permits, among other things. This legislative package will decrease the burden on businesses by reducing unnecessary regulations and promoting pro-growth tax policy. It passed 253-163.	858844724154935

173604349345646	I voted no on the Democrats' motion to recommit (return to committee) #HJRes124.

212027388827797	Over the course of this past week I was able to attend the Detroit Regional Chamber Mackinac Policy Conference on Mackinac Island. This conference is a yearly opportunity to talk with fellow Michiganders about important issues that matter most to those right here in Southwest Michigan.\n\nOn Wednesday, I joined my colleague Senator Debbie Stabenow, D-Lansing, to unveil a “Bipartisan Action Plan for a Brighter Michigan.” \n\nUnder our leadership, the entire Michigan Congressional Delegation has been meeting regularly to discuss ways we in Washington can improve the lives of everyone here at home. It’s also a good way to get to know our fellow Michigan legislators better and it opens the door to all sorts of bipartisan cooperation that produces real results for Michigan.\n\nFrom working together on issues like fighting Asian Carp, banning synthetic plastic microbeads that pollute our Great Lakes, working to protect and expand our military and defense installations, making sure that Michigan stays on the cutting edge of medical innovations, and working to create local jobs and a stronger Michigan economy– we are better positioned to succeed when we work together.\n\nYou hear a lot about dysfunction in Washington – but the Michigan Congressional Delegation remains ever-committed to putting the needs of everyone in our state above party politics and working to get the job done for you.\n\nWhen both sides of the aisle and both sides of the U.S. Capitol come together to maximize Michigan’s voice and impact – we can certainly accomplish a great deal. That’s what our bipartisan action plan for a brighter Michigan is all about. #MPC15	953856694644859

212027388827797	Inspiration comes in all shapes and sizes....\n\n“I can and I will” is the motto of Brooke and Brielle Kennedy, who live in Mattawan, Michigan. They are battling Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a rare disease that destroys the nerves controlling voluntary muscle movement. They were diagnosed with SMA Type II shortly after their births. Their whole lives have been a constant battle with trial treatments and drugs, physical therapy, rehabilitation, and the many daily struggles SMA brings.\n\nThrough it all, Brooke and Brielle - and their determined parents Sarah and Eric  - have faced these challenges with bravery, optimism, and infectious smiles. They have a presence that is indescribable. Their cheerfulness and determination compelled me to do all I could do help.\n\nI first met Brooke and Brielle, or Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty as they are sometimes called, in 2011 and was told of their story battling SMA. With the help of their parents I was given a firsthand look at the challenges facing families with loved ones suffering from rare diseases. Clinical trials take time and money, research funding is low, the approval process for treatments is slow and inefficient, and the rarity of diseases like SMA means there are very few people to test potential cures. But mostly, there is a lot of frustration and not a lot of hope.\n\nThat’s where Brooke and Brielle come in. They are powerful voices that helped me and the Energy and Commerce Committee get the National Pediatric Research Network Act signed into law in November 2013 following a multi-year and multi-Congress effort. That was just the beginning. \n\nWith the help of the Kennedys and many other patient advocates, researchers, and health care innovators, the 21st Century Cures initiative continues to bring hope to those dealing with the thousands of diseases without cures. For the past year, we have been gathering information on how Congress can speed up the approval process for treatments and cures, expand medical research, encourage innovation, and ultimately save more lives.\n\nWe plan to have legislation to accelerate cures and treatments for diseases on the president’s desk by the end of this year. This legislation will have the potential to change not only Brooke and Brielle’s lives, but also the lives of many other patients and families across America. Brooke and Brielle may be little, but they have had a big impact on Congress and have inspired hope for so many. \n\nBrooke and Brielle are two of the brightest stars I know. We have the chance to do something big, and this is our time. And it is Brooke and Brielle’s time.\n\nLearn more: http://bit.ly/Cures2015	945296802167515

212027388827797	#NationalPoliceWeek is a time to reflect and thank those who protect and serve every single day. Today I met with Van Buren County Deputy Brian Matthews and his family to congratulate him for being honored today at the National Police Officer Memorial for winning “Officer of the Month” in June of 2014 by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.\n\nIn March of 2014, Matthews and other officers were returning on a flight from a week of training in Arizona on March 2, 2014, when an officer from Muskegon suffered a stroke. Thanks to Matthews’s quick thinking and action, he was able to assist and stabilize the injured officer. The flight made an emergency landing, and the injured officer was quickly ushered to a local hospital where he was treated and released. Without Matthews providing assistance and steady calm, the injured officer may have suffered grave consequences. \n\nI offer a heartfelt thank you to Deputy Matthews, his family, and all of our brave police officers for their service and dedication to our communities and country.	944513615579167
212027388827797	21st Century Cures is about embracing technological and scientific advancements to get treatments and cures to patients more quickly. It’s a forward-looking approach to health care, using new strategies to fight disease rather than doing things the way they've been done in the past.\n\nWhen a new drug or device is developed, it must go through a clinical trial to test its safety and effectiveness. The gold standard for how these trials are conducted was developed decades ago, and a lot has changed since then. Modernizing clinical trials is essential in achieving our health innovation goals.\n\nClinical trials are slow and expensive. In fact, their cost and time to completion are at all-time highs. While there has been a number of promising advancements, our current regulatory structure does not fully embrace the potential of personalized medicine. Throughout our yearlong 21st Century Cures listening tour we heard time and again that addressing clinical trials is vital if we are going to get lifesaving and improving medical products to market more quickly.\n\n“Clinical trials need to be modernized for the molecular age.” So explained Dr. Roy Herbst, Chief of Medical Oncology at the Yale Cancer Center and co-chair of the Lung-MAP Trial, which is an innovative and personalized clinical trial for lung cancer. He’s right. Our approach to health research has advanced thanks to innovations at the molecular level, but our approach to health product regulation has not kept pace.\n\nWilliam Murray, President and CEO of the Medical Device Innovation Consortium, summed up the potential benefits of reform: “We believe that clinical trial innovation has the potential to improve the safety and effectiveness of products being introduced into the market, reduce clinical trial timelines and costs, and give U.S. patients earlier access to beneficial innovative technologies.”\n\nBetter treatments for patients is reason enough for reform, but we cannot ignore the economic cost of an outdated approach to clinical trials. Mike Carusi, testifying on behalf of the National Venture Capital Association, explained during a June 2014 hearing, “A small, venture-backed company typically spends $500,000 to $2 million per month in operating costs as it conducts clinical trials and awaits regulatory approval.”\n\nWhat can we do about it? For starters, let’s ditch the unnecessary paperwork. It wastes time and money.\n\nNext, we can make it easier to find patients who could benefit from the research. Clinical trials for children can be some of the most difficult to conduct, and at least part of the reason why is because it’s hard for sick children and pediatric researchers to find each other. The 21st Century Cures initiative establishes a Global Pediatric Clinical Trial Network to cut time from the process by helping developers identify patients much more quickly than if they had to recruit participants on their own. Providing hope to these children is what drives this effort.\n\nMore flexibility in the design of clinical trials is another opportunity for reform. This includes use of biomarkers, biostatistics, and adaptive trial designs — all of which are tools to customize a trial based on the unique characteristics of patients most likely to benefit. The rise of personalized and precision medicine means treatments can be significantly more targeted for a patient’s individual genetic makeup or illness. Embracing these tools will help us better identify individuals eligible for trials and ultimately get the most effective treatments and data sooner.\n\nUltimately, clinical trials are about the patients who raise their hand and say, “I want to try a new therapy. I want to test a new treatment. I want to help you learn not only would could help me, but many others like me.” Clinical trials are a chance to better understand diseases so we can eventually beat them. Even if a clinical trial fails, the data and lessons learned contribute to someday finding cures.\n\nClinical trials are a linchpin in the discovery, development, and delivery cycle for cures. Health breakthroughs are meaningless if we cannot test and prove them in real patients. So let’s make clinical trials better. Let’s make them faster, safer, and more personalized. We owe it to the patients who are on the front lines trying new treatments, and those who will follow and benefit when they work.	944109502286245

187654104587692	Despite the $700 million border bill already passed by House Republicans, the President has chosen to ignore Congress, the American people, and the root problems in our broken immigration system.

The American people are looking for real solutions on jobs, promoting our economy, and a workable immigration policy – not more executive orders.	868423626510733

223726364320243	During the #Selma50 Commemoration, I had the opportunity to hear reflections from Mary Liuzzo Lilliboe, daughter of Viola Liuzzo. A proud Detroit citizen, Viola answered the call to join activists after Bloody Sunday and drove herself  to participate in the #Selma to Montgomery marches. Her daughter recalled hearing she was killed by the KKK.  Her activism in the Civil Rights Movement, and her sacrifice helped pass the Voting Rights Act later in 1965.	1175318672494336

223726364320243	I'm very proud of Macomb County and the Macomb Intermediate School District partnering to  lead the effort to highlight #NationalManufacturingDay at over 31 companies while partnering with 21 school districts. Here at KUKA Systems., students from Stevenson High School learned about exciting career opportunities in manufacturing.	1054237094602495
223726364320243	Today is #NationalManufacturingDay, a day when we focus on the importance of #manufacturing to the U.S. economy.  America’s manufacturers have created jobs at the fastest pace in 15 years, with over 700,000 new jobs added since February 2010.\n\nWe can do more to spur the manufacturing sector.  The House of Representatives just approved a bill I cosponsored, the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act.  This bill will establish a Network for Manufacturing Innovation to improve the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing, stimulate R&D, and increase domestic production.  It will create many more Centers for Manufacturing Innovation, such as the manufacturing center recently awarded to southeastern Michigan that will focus on advanced materials.  We also need to address the currency manipulation of trading partners like China that puts our manufacturers at a disadvantage.	1053538501339021
223726364320243	Flood Follow-up…The State of Michigan and FEMA are doing a joint preliminary damage assessment this week and next.  This is an important preliminary step that will allow the Governor to determine if the state will request Federal assistance from FEMA.  My office coordinated two update calls last week with local, county and state officials and all are working together on this phrase of damage assessment.	1026081144084757
223726364320243	Flood Follow-up…As state, county and local communities continue working hard to assess the damage from this week’s flooding, it is also important for local homeowners to document damage and maintain receipts of their own clean-up expenses.  Although it is too early to know and it depends on the State damage assessment, it is important to be prepared should there be a future federal emergency declaration.	1019578744734997
223726364320243	These have been a tough couple days in our communities.  I know many families are still struggling with property damage and the loss of personal items.  We are all appreciative of local, county and state emergency response teams in Oakland and Macomb and I have been impressed with the collaboration between all levels of government.   Local and county leaders continue to assess the scope of the damage so that the State can make a comprehensive request for federal assistance, which I strongly support.	1018896071469931
223726364320243	Rest in Peace Maya Angelou.  You once said, “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”  On numerous occasions you made us feel as if you were describing the world around us in a way that was larger than life.	963995223626683
223726364320243	This week is #NationalSmallBusinessWeek! Small businesses are the engine that keeps our economy going.  In honor of #NSBW I would like to highlight one of our very own small businesses right here in Ferndale MI.  The The Rust Belt Market.  The Rust Belt Market is owned by Chris and Tiffany Best and recently celebrated its third year of operation. It is #Michigan’s first year-round indie market for artists, designers, vintage collectors, and foodies. The Rust Belt Market is not just a shopping venue, it’s  a place that seeks to help other small, creative-based businesses to grow and help our communities.	952122518147287

223726364320243	With today's important news about enrollment in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, Americans have spoken by the millions in their desire for more affordable, comprehensive health insurance.

223726364320243	Rep. John D. Dingell has been a pillar of unique strength for Michigan and the entire nation in the U.S. House of Representatives.  His exceptional combination of legislative prowess and a deep respect for those individuals whom he prided in representing in Congress stands as a model of public service.  His legislative accomplishments will be well recorded in the history books as they have touched every aspect of modern life, yet it is my hope that his wise counsel and deep feelings about the institution he cares so deeply about will be heard by all as well.	900699446622928

210401648605	Last month, the World Trade Organization (WTO), for the fourth and final time, ruled against the United States’ country-of-origin labeling requirements on retailers for fresh beef, pork, and chicken. In its decision, the WTO found these provisions violated current trade agreements and, thus, gave Canada and Mexico permission to impose retaliatory sanctions on U.S. exports, including an estimated $3.2 billion worth of Michigan exports. \n\nToday, I joined my colleagues in the House to repeal these labeling requirements, which have proven to be a costly, failed experiment that, if not repealed, would bring about sanctions that would have a devastating impact on our state and national economy. Purchasing billions of dollars’ worth of Michigan goods and products annually, Canada serves as our largest trading partner, and maintaining a favorable trade relationship with our northern neighbor and ally is critical to Michigan’s economic success.	10153426768638606
210401648605	On Saturday, we celebrated National Trails Day, a celebration of America’s magnificent bike and hike paths that improve the quality of life for local communities that enjoy them, including those in Michigan’s 10th District. 35 years ago, I was pleased to help pave the way for the first hike and bike path in Harrison Township along the Metropolitan Parkway.  More recently, I helped secure funding for the Macomb Orchard Trail, a 24-mile paved trail that provides free recreation for people of all abilities to enjoy in Northern Macomb.  Over  the years, I have enjoyed the federal, state and local cooperation that has allowed for these paths, which are such an asset to our local communities.	10153423944768606
210401648605	Last April, the EPA issued its proposed rule to vastly expand U.S. waters subject to federal regulation without first consulting state and local authorities and other impacted stakeholders.  As a result, the proposed rule, which would have an especially devastating impact on American farmers, received overwhelming rejection. \n\nIgnoring rational opposition and states’ rights, the EPA, today, issued its final rule, which is yet another blatant overreach by this Administration determined to put politics ahead of Americans. Fortunately, this isn’t over.  Earlier his month, the House passed the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015, legislation that, if adopted, will require the EPA to rescind its flawed rule and to consult with state and local governments before issuing a new rule, thus restoring the federal-state partnership originally established by the Clean Water Act.  \n\nNow, more than ever, this legislation is necessary to restore the integrity of our regulatory process and protect the hardworking Americans that too often have to pay the high price of compliance – especially our farmers.  I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to take immediate action and pass this important bill.	10153388795893606
210401648605	Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld an injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, blocking the President’s recent executive actions on immigration known as the Deferred Action for Parents of American and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program, which also includes a provision to expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. President Obama’s executive action on immigration was a blatant constitutional overreach that would have automatically granted amnesty to millions of immigrants here illegally. He, himself, has said on 22 occasions that he lacks the authority to take such action.  I agree, and it appears that the courts do as well.  I applaud today’s ruling and am confident that the final constitutional questions regarding this matter will properly be decided in the courts – where they belong.	10153386397488606
210401648605	This National Teacher Appreciation Week (May 4th – 8th) we are especially grateful for those educators who make such a profound, lasting difference in the lives of our future generations. Coming from a family of many teachers, including my grandmother, my aunt, my cousin, and my niece, I understand the vital role teachers play in shaping the minds of our children and grandchildren. Great teachers not only teach the subjects and skills our students need, but inspire their imagination.	10153329002483606

210401648605	Today, I joined MDOT and other state and local officials to celebrate the opening of the Port Huron Welcome Center. With millions of tourists crossing the Blue Water Bridge annually, the new Port Huron Welcome Center will serve as a showcase for all of the magnificent attractions Michigan has to offer. MDOT deserves a lot of credit for spearheading the new center, as well as the entire reconstruction project along I-69 and I-94 between Lapeer Road and Pine Grove Avenue, which includes the new bridge over the Black River. MDOT is even dedicating $100,000 annually to Port Huron for new economic development projects like the recently constructed Blue Water Convention Center, demonstrating its commitment to the Blue Water Area and its revitalization.	10153370179193606
210401648605	Today, I welcomed members of the Port Sanilac Marching Band to the nation’s capital. It was a pleasure meeting these spirited young Americans who are a reflection of our nation’s bright future.	10153367138158606
210401648605	For the second consecutive winter, ice coverage on the Great Lakes was well above normal this year with a peak of 89 percent of the Great Lakes basin covered in ice – last year was even worse with 92 percent covered in ice. These harsh conditions can seriously impede commercial navigation critical to the economic success of the eight Great Lakes states, as well as the entire U.S. and Canada. In a strong economy, the Great Lakes can handle 200 million tons of cargo, support 227,000 jobs, contribute $33.5 billion to the economy, pay $14.1 billion in salaries, and provide $4.6 billion in tax revenues.\n\nTo keep commerce safely moving across our Great Lakes year round, we rely on the U.S. Coast Guard. Unfortunately, the Coast Guard’s aging fleet on the Great Lakes – which includes only nine icebreaking-capable cutters – is challenging their vital mission to keep our waterways clear and safe, which is why I have included a provision in this authorization to allow the Coast Guard to add a new icebreaker to the Great Lakes fleet.  Starting the acquisition process now will minimize the loss of operating hours on the water as older cutters undergo repairs and maintenance. The brave men and women who serve in the U.S. Coast Guard put themselves in harm’s way and often face harsh conditions to secure our waterways, and we must ensure they have the resources they need to safely do their job.	10153360624973606
210401648605	Today marks the  50th anniversary of Head Start, a nationwide program that helps ensure members of our youngest generation have the educational opportunities they need to succeed. Last year, I had a chance to spend time with the bright Head Start students at New Haven Elementary, just a few of the tens-of-millions of children Project Head Start has served since its creation in 1965. As a mother and grandmother, I know how important early childhood education is to a child’s development, which is why I have supported and will continue to support legislation to expand this important program.	10153359163823606
210401648605	Today, in celebration of Armed Forces Day, we honor the brave men and women who have served our country with valor and bravery and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice protecting our liberty and democracy. Thank you to those Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who make it possible for us to enjoy the freedoms that make this nation the greatest in the world. For your service, we will be eternally grateful.	10153352531818606
210401648605	I am honored to have had the opportunity to join the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment and the U.S. Army Band for a recent performance of this year's Twilight Tattoo. Throughout history, our brave soldiers have sacrificed and served our country with honor and bravery, protecting our freedom, liberty, and democracy. This incredible performance did an amazing job telling their story and the powerful history of the United States Army, from the Revolutionary War, to the War of 1812, to the Army's leadership combating today's global conflicts.	10153350194658606
210401648605	Last month, a federal jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty of 30 federal charges, including counts for conspiring to use and using weapons of mass destruction in a heinous attack at the Boston Marathon that killed three innocent civilians and one police officer and injured nearly three hundred others. Today, in what was a unanimous decision, that same jury sentenced him to death – a punishment fitting for the suffering and loss he and his brother caused. I agree with the jury’s decision and hope the family and friends of those killed and injured in that senseless attack know justice has been served and that the entire country shares their grief and prays that they find peace.	10153349854683606
210401648605	This week, National Police Week (May 11th-17th), we acknowledge the police officers that protect and serve our local communities, especially the outstanding law enforcement officers that serve in Michigan’s 10th Congressional District.  This is also a time to remember and honor those who have lost their lives in the line of duty.  We are grateful for their service.	10153340751098606
210401648605	Today, I joined the Paslin Company, including Paslin Company CEO Kirk Goins, to celebrate the grand opening of their 4th facility in Macomb County in Shelby Township, MI.  The expansion of this longtime, family-owned business is sure to be an economic boost to the community and will contribute to the continued resurgence of the automotive industry here in the heartland of American innovation.	10153334853468606
210401648605	Millions of people’s social and economic livelihoods are dependent on the Great Lakes and their precious resources, including the fresh drinking water they supply for millions. That is why it is so critical we do everything within our means to preserve and protect them for future generations, which includes preventing the storage of nuclear waste in close proximity to Lake Huron as proposed by the Ontario Power Generation company.  \n\nLast February, I wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry asking that he engage the International Joint Commission to encourage the Canadian government to reassess their plans to dump nuclear waste near Lake Huron, as such a move could endanger the health of the Lakes and create a public safety hazard.  Last night, with the endorsement of a Canadian Joint Review Panel, Canada is getting closer to approving the hazardous project and could even authorize the final license within the next several months. \n\nStoring radioactive nuclear waste within a mile of Lake Huron unnecessarily puts our magnificent Lakes in danger – posing a threat to both the U.S. and Canadian residents who rely on them. We must act before it is too late, which is why I am calling on Secretary Kerry again to take action. Canada has always been a great neighbor and ally of the U.S., as well as a great steward of the Lakes, and I believe that, working through the International Joint Commission, we can come up with a viable alternate site for their proposed nuclear waste facility.\n\nAdditionally, instead of just pointing fingers at the Canadians, the U.S. should address its own nuclear storage facility issues and finally advance the long-studied, overdue nuclear waste repository in Yucca Mountain that Senate Democrats have blocked.	10153332455113606

210401648605	Today marks the start of National Small Business Week (May 4-8), an opportunity to acknowledge the important role small businesses play in our growing economy.  With an estimated 28 million small businesses in the U.S., they employ half of America’s workforce and account for 7 out of every 10 new jobs.  This week,  let’s show our support for our local small businesses and their hardworking employees that help drive our economy.	10153326529063606
210401648605	Today, DTE Energy obtained a license to build a second nuclear energy facility at its Fermi plant.  This approval, which included an extensive, six-year examination of DTE’s remarkable safety and environmental practices, will help DTE ensure it is able to continue its already diverse approach to delivering clean energy at a low cost to Michigan residents. I strongly believe that energy independence equals national security, and we must continue to produce domestic energy and wean the U.S. off its heavy reliance on foreign fossil fuels. Our domestic energy portfolio must be comprehensive and include all forms of energy, and nuclear is an important component of that.	10153319248173606
210401648605	Today, the House Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee passed the U.S. Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015, which included a provision I submitted authorizing the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard to design and build a new icebreaker for its Great Lakes fleet. This past winter, for the second consecutive year, ice coverage on the Great Lakes was well above normal. In fact, this year saw a peak of 89 percent of the Great Lakes basin covered in ice – last year was even worse with 92 percent covered in ice. Unfortunately, the Coast Guard’s aging fleet on the Great Lakes – which includes only nine icebreaking-capable cutters – is challenging their vital mission to keep our waterways clear and safe. While today’s Committee passage is an important first step, there are more steps in the process , both in the House and Senate. Read more: http://goo.gl/sxwnM4	10153319013173606
210401648605	Today’s announcement that GM will be investing $5.4 billion into its U.S. plants – starting with $783 million in Michigan alone – is further proof that our domestic auto industry is not only coming back from difficult times, but coming back strong.  Those who questioned the resilience of our domestic automotive industry and the hardworking men and women who make Southeast Michigan the heartland of American innovation have once again been proven wrong.  Today’s announcement is also further proof of the outstanding leadership and vision provided by GM CEO Mary Barra and her strong commitment to continuing to build this industry right here at home.  I applaud this announcement and believe that, looking back, this continued, sustained and strong growth of the domestic auto industry confirms that providing bridge loans to help this vital industry through the economic collapse was the right thing to do.  I offer my sincere congratulations and thanks to all of the hardworking men and women who make up General Motors, who really help keep our region, our state and nation driving forward toward a better future.	10153318566458606
210401648605	It was great having Port Huron Northern marching band in Washington D.C. a couple of weeks ago to participate in the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade.  These talented high school students were a showstopper performing “Everybody’s Everything,” by Santana for the parade’s grand finale across from the White House.  My office was pleased to arrange a Capitol tour for these great young Americans while they were in DC.	10153309918243606
210401648605	Today, I joined members of the St. Clair County Board of Commissioners at the grand opening of the Blue Water Convention Center. Already, as a result of the new development, we are seeing new spinoff businesses and economic expansion, and the new convention center, which highlights Port Huron’s beautiful shoreline, will undoubtedly serve as an anchor for the area’s continued growth and revitalization.	10153283670008606
210401648605	According to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, U.S. taxpayers spend an estimated 7.6 billion hours each year filing taxes, and that doesn’t even include the millions of additional hours taxpayers spend responding to IRS notices and audits.  Taxpayers deserve a simpler, fairer tax code that allows them to keep more of their hard-earned money.  They also need assurances that the very institutions intended to serve them are held to the highest standards of accountability. This week, the House will consider legislation that reduces barriers to financial independence, increases transparency, fairness and accountability at the IRS, and helps Americans keep more of their hard-earned money.	10153272383338606
210401648605	A recent AP review of 940 VA facilities across the country shows that the 27 VA facilities in Michigan have continued to improve patient wait times. Additionally, of the 27 Michigan VA facilities, the 10th District’s Bad Axe and Yale facilities are among those that demonstrated the lowest percentage of delayed care. While there is always room for improvement, the dedicated healthcare providers at these facilities should be commended for their commitment to providing our veterans with the quality care they have earned. http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/04/08/michigan-veterans-clinics-cut-waits/25500947/	10153265495533606
210401648605	Two years ago this month, chaos erupted as Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, carried out a horrendous attack at the Boston Marathon that killed three innocent civilians and one police officer and injured nearly three hundred others. Today, with the federal jury’s announcement that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving brother, has been found guilty of all 30 charges against him for this horrific attack and will – at a minimum spend the rest of his life in prison – Americans can have confidence in our judicial process and its ability to bring the full force of justice upon anyone who attempts to inflict harm on this great country and its citizens.	10153259523253606
210401648605	Today, I joined members of the Blue Water Area Chamber of Commerce at their annual State of the County event.  St. Clair has experienced a boom of new economic development that has led to job growth and greater opportunities for local residents. This economic expansion, driven by business leaders across the county, has made the Blue Water Area a great destination for tourists and an amazing place to call home.  I tremendously enjoyed meeting with them today, and I commend them on their success.	10153228915368606

316865541750741	I voted “yes” on H.Res 599. This resolution urges the government of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) to respect the freedom of assembly, expression, and religion and all fundamental human rights and the rule of law for all its citizens and to stop censoring discussion of the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations and their violent suppression. In addition to concealing information about Tiananmen Square, the PRC continues to harass and detain peaceful human rights advocates, including over 1,300 prisoners of conscience. The bill passed 379-1.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 503 - the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act. This bill authorizes the National Desert Storm Memorial Association to establish a commemorative work on federal land in the District of Columbia to commemorate and honor those who served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield.  No federal funding can be used for the memorial. I was a cosponsor of this bill to honor the sacrifices of our brave service members who fought in these wars. The bill passed 370-0.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 4660 - making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. This bill reduces spending by almost $400 million compared to FY2014 enacted levels. The bill includes a number of significant policy items including Second Amendment protections and pro-life provisions. Also, the bill places an emphasis on combating human trafficking. The bill passed 321-87.\n \nI voted “no” on H.R. 4681 - Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015. I support the work our intelligence community does to keep this country safe. However, I am deeply concerned by recent revelations of the NSA and other intelligence agencies committing unethical acts and infringing upon the rights of U.S. citizens. As this bill did not contain sufficient provisions to rein in the intelligence community and preserve the principles upon which this country was founded, I voted “no.” The bill passed 345-59.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 4412 - to authorize the programs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration authorized programs, activities, and reports respecting NASA, including those with regard to human exploration of space, the Space Launch System, the Orion multipurpose crew vehicle, the commercial crew program, the International Space Station (ISS), radioisotope thermoelectric generators, extrasolar planet exploration, the James Webb Space Telescope, the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, near-Earth objects, space weather, the Deep Space Climate Observatory, land imaging remote sensing data, aeronautics research, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, project and program reserves, and orbital debris mitigation. NASA has played an integral part in our technological development, and space travel is important to the future of mankind. The bill passed 401-2.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 4810 -the Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014. This bill allows veterans who have waited longer than 30 days for an appointment or live over 40 miles from the nearest VHA facility to seek non-VA healthcare. Fifty-seven thousand of our veterans are currently waiting for healthcare due to the VA’s inability to schedule them properly. This bill is a solution to the VHA backlog and ensures that our veterans will never again have to suffer while waiting months for a primary healthcare visit. The bill passed 426-0.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 4745 - making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. While I wish that there could have been more reforms to how we pay for infrastructure spending, such as the ROAR Act (H.R. 4945) that I have introduced and the Transportation Empowerment Act (H.R 3264) that I have cosponsored, one of the biggest concerns I hear about from my constituents is road funding. I voted yes, and the bill passed 229-192.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 4457 – the America’s Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014. This bill enables businesses to expense up to $500,000 of investments in new equipment and property per year for tax purposes. Immediate expensing, rather than depreciating over a multi-year period, helps business owners invest in new equipment and expand their businesses. The bill passed 272-144.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 4453 – the S Corporation Permanent Tax Relief Act of 2014. The bill provides a permanent five-year recognition period for built-in-gains of an S corporation.  Additionally, the bill makes permanent the treatment of certain basis adjustments for S corporations making charitable contributions of property. The bill passed 263-155.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.Res. 617 - Condemning the abduction of female students by armed militants from the terrorist group known as Boko Haram in northeastern provinces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This resolution expresses support for the families of the girls that were abducted and calls for their immediate release.  The resolution also supports initiatives to promote the human rights of women and girls in Nigeria, and encourages the President to provide Congress with a comprehensive strategy to counter growing threats of radical Islamist terrorist groups in parts of Africa. The resolution passed 411-2.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 3375 - to designate the community-based outpatient clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs to be constructed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as the “PFC Floyd K. Lindstrom Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic”. Floyd K. Lindstrom (June 21, 1912 – February 3, 1944) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the military's highest decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions in World War II. The bill passed 396-0.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 1671 - to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located in Dublin, California, as the “James ’Jim’ Kohnen Post Office”. Dr. Kohnen retired from the U.S. Army Reserves as a Colonel in the Corps of Engineers after 30 years of service. He volunteered for a variety of service organizations in the East Bay, CA, and served as an elected or appointed official on five local boards. Dr. Kohnen passed away on May 29, 2012.The bill passed 398-0.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 4870 - Making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. This bill provides the necessary resources to protect our service members and maintain a strong national defense. I support our military and was proud to vote “yes” on H.R. 4870. The bill passed 340-73.\n \nI voted “yes” on S. 1044 – the World War II Memorial Prayer Act. The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to install at the World War II Memorial an inscription of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s D-Day Prayer. On the morning of June 6, 1944, the day Americans stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, President Roosevelt addressed the nation with this prayer. The bill prohibits the use of federal funds and allows the Secretary to accept private donations for the project. The bill passed 370-12.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 316 (concur in the Senate Amendment) – the Collinsville Renewable Energy Production Act. The Senate amendment to H.R. 316 authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to reinstate terminated hydroelectric licenses for two projects in Canton, Connecticut at the town’s request. The bill passed 379-3.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 4413 – the Customer Protection and End User Relief Act. This bill reauthorizes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which regulates the derivatives market (futures and swaps). This bill provides certain regulatory relief from Dodd-Frank provisions that negatively impact end-users, such as farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, who utilize these products to hedge risk. Also, H.R. 4413 ensures that the agency performs cost-benefit studies and considers feedback from stakeholders when creating regulations. The bill passed 265-144.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 3301 – the North American Energy Infrastructure Act. This important piece of legislation promotes the construction of cross-border oil and natural gas pipelines.  It improves the efficiency of the approval process by eliminating red tape and burdensome regulations.  In recent years, U.S. and Canadian production has increased, and facilitating the transportation, import, and export of natural gas and oil is important to growing our economy. The bill passed 238-173.\n \nI voted “yes” on H.R. 4899 – the Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act. This bill provides for the expansion of onshore energy production, cuts red tape, and streamlines the permitting process.  Increased production can mean lower prices at the pump, for heating, for transportation, and for goods. The bill provides for timely approval of permits, requires new lease sales, and reforms the onshore permitting process.   The bill contains provisions for increased offshore production, as well.  Reducing the amount of imported oil and gas is important for U.S. energy security, and this legislation helps to achieve energy independence. The bill passed 229-185.	566654440105182

316865541750741	This evening I voted ‘yes’ on H.Res 676, which authorizes the Speaker to initiate or intervene in one or more civil actions on behalf of the House of Representatives in federal court against our lawless president. Congressman Bentivolio released the following statement:\n \nAmericans do not elect kings with four-year terms; we elect presidents who have the duty of executing the laws passed by Congress as they are written.\n \nThis president has arbitrarily changed his own healthcare law in order to protect him from negative political outcomes.\n \nThat is wrong and it undermines the rule of law and the Constitution.\n \nI served in two wars and I swore an solemn oath to protect the Constitution. I saw good men die or be injured following that oath.\n \nI happily voted for H.Res. 676 because it’s time for the president to follow the law rather than undermine it.	536146983155928

316865541750741	Thank you for submitting your immigration questions last week. Here are some of the questions we will ask HHS, FEMA, & DHS about the humanitarian crisis on the border and how it will affect Michigan.\n \n1.            How is our government verifying the identity of these children? Age? Nationality? Human trafficking status?\n \n2.            How does our government verify the identity of any adult taking custody of the minor? And have any of these children been released to those already here illegally?\n \n3.            What medical conditions have been reported thus far? Are any of them contagious? What is the health status of the children sent to Michigan specifically?\n \n4.            How many people have failed to appear at hearings in Michigan in the last 48 months?\n \n5.            How many agents are assigned to locate permitted travelling aliens that have not appeared as ordered in a Michigan court?\n \n6.            Question for DHS: what is DHS doing to find out who/what is providing the planning and resources to migrate people from central America to the USA? Obviously children are not coming here without help and coordinated efforts.\n \n7.            How many housing facilities are being sought in Michigan? Have any been approved? Who approves them? \n\n8.            How much money are Michigan taxpayers expected to contribute to house undocumented immigrants in facilities in Michigan?  \n \n9.            Will the children receive all of the required immunizations to enter into the US?\n \n10.          How much does it cost to operate a facility in Michigan? Cost per person? Per Day?\n \n11.          How does the Administration plan on securing the border and enforcing current immigration law?	529729203797706

316865541750741	The President has time to attend two fundraisers in Texas today, but he doesn't have time to visit the border or address the ongoing humanitarian crisis there.	527628930674400
316865541750741	Before we talk about comprehensive immigration reform, I propose that we secure our borders and enforce the laws we have on the books. We can't reform our immigration system until we have control of it, starting with our borders. How would you address the current border crisis? Do you think the President should visit the border to see the problem for himself?	527244817379478

316865541750741	On Tuesday I proudly supported the passage of H.R. 4810, the Veterans Access to Care Act. This bill, which also passed the Senate as part of a larger reform, enables veterans to use a non-VA healthcare provider for care if they have been waiting for an appointment longer than the VA's mandated wait time, have been told they cannot get an appointment within that time, or who live at least 40 miles away from a VA facility . \n\nIt is outrageous that our veterans have been placed on secret lists or forced to wait up to 200 days for their basic healthcare needs. It's past time the VA take responsibility for the veterans who have been suffering without proper treatment and do all in their power to give them the best possible treatment in the shortest amount of time. As a veteran, I am furious at the treatment of my fellow warfighters at the hands of the VA, and will do all that I can to correct this injustice.\n\nH.R. 4810 requires that the VA work with non-VA healthcare facilities to ensure that veterans can be seen within the mandated wait times. If a veteran visits a non-VA facility, the VA must reimburse the facility for the veterans' healthcare, including all follow-up treatment and visits for 60 days. Additionally, this bill requires the VA to enter into a contract with an independent entity to assess the Veterans' Healthcare Administration and provide recommendations for its improvement.\n\nThe bill also prohibits all bonuses for VA employees through FY2016.	516362578467702
87490183861	Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season and new year to all. It is an honor to continue to serve you in Congress. Blessings on you.	10151844588568862
87490183861	I'm looking forward to joining a group of my fellow veterans for breakfast with President Obama at the White House tomorrow. Happy Veterans Day.	10151754954153862
316865541750741	The President broke the law by not informing Congress thirty days prior to the release of any GITMO detainees. The administration’s claim that Sgt. Bergdahl was in rapidly failing health is questionable; it’s improbable that there was a way to verify Sgt. Bergdahl’s condition prior to the transfer. I am outraged by this flagrant disregard for the laws that are designed to keep this government from committing abuses against both its citizens and abroad.\n \nWhile I’m happy to see Sgt. Bergdahl return home, the ramifications of the prisoner trade are concerning, considering the five Taliban leaders released have known ties to Al-Qaeda. One is wanted by the UN for committing human rights atrocities and should be held accountable for his crimes, not released into Qatar under supposed supervision. These five men are classified as a high risk to return to planning and carrying out attacks on innocents around the globe. Their release is both dangerous and shortsighted.\n\nThe President of the United States must respect the rule of law and the division of powers set forth by our Founding Fathers. The executive branch cannot use executive orders and claims of needed immediate action to avoid answering to Congress and to the American people. \n\nIt's disturbing that the President would go to extraordinary lengths to rescue a soldier who allegedly went AWOL, but refused to assist an ambassador who was under fire.	512357262201567
316865541750741	I voted “no” on the H.R. 3361, the USA FREEDOM Act. Originally, this bill was designed to stop the unlawful collection of data on American citizens. I proudly cosponsored this strong version of the bill. However, the revised version voted on today contained only weak language prohibiting mass data collection, had no provisions against  back door targeting, and removed the special privacy advocate provisions that the FISA court so desperately needs. We need surveillance reform, but this bill would do little to nothing to protect American citizens and allow lawmakers to hide behind ineffective reforms. The bill passed 303-121.	511920672245226
316865541750741	I voted “yes” on the Conference Report to H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act.  The bill authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to undertake various water related projects that are important to the U.S. economy, trade, and various industries.  The proper maintenance and construction of water projects, such as dams, locks, and harbors, are vital to the facilitation of American trade and transport – and investing in our infrastructure is an important step to help our economy grow.  The cost of newly authorized projects in the bill is more than offset by the de-authorization of old, inactive projects. The bill passed 412-4.\n\nI voted “yes” on H.R. 2203, which authorizes the award of a gold medal to Jack Nicklaus. He amassed 120 victories in professional competition, including 73 wins on the Professional Golf Association (PGA) Tour.  Nicklaus won 18 professional majors, the most of any golfer in history. In 2005, President George W. Bush awarded him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Also, he has a long-standing commitment to charitable causes, including the Nicklaus Children’s Health Care Foundation, which provides pediatric health care services.  In 2012, the Miami Children’s Hospital opened the Nicklaus Outpatient Center to provide pediatric urgent care, diagnostic service, and rehabilitation services in Palm Beach County.  Nicklaus also supports numerous junior golf initiatives and serves as an honorary chair of the American Lake Veterans Golf Course in Tacoma, Washington, which is designed for the rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. The cost of medal is $35,000 which should be offset by the sale of duplicate bronze medals. The bill passed 3710-10.\n\nI voted “yes” on H.R. 685, to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the elite group of American fighter pilots, the Fighter Aces, because of their work protecting Americans and her interests. An American Fighter Ace is a pilot who has destroyed five or more confirmed enemy aircraft.  As a veteran, it is imperative we support our troops and give recognition for their service, bravery, and commitment to the values and principles we as a nation stand for. I know first-hand there is nothing free about freedom, and at a minimum, we should honor our military which has put it all on the line for us so we don’t have to. I proudly cosponsored H.R. 685. The bill passed 381-0.	511920638911896
316865541750741	Happy Memorial Day. A big thank you to all who have served and currently serve our great nation.	509123805858246
316865541750741	I voted “yes” on H.Res. 567 which provides for the establishment of a Select Committee on the events surrounding the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi. I was a proud cosponsor of this resolution and strongly support the expedited creation of this committee. What happened in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012, was horrific, and it is a great tragedy that we have neither caught those responsible nor determined how this foreign policy failure was allowed to occur. It is time we hold all those involved accountable for their actions. The resolution passed 232-186.	506463259457634
87490183861	Proud to have stood alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on July 2, 1964, as President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law. Here's a photo of the signing (can you spot me?), and a page from LBJ's White House diary noting those present at the event. \n\nThis remains one of my proudest moments in Congress, and I'm truly blessed to be here and see the many ways people have continued the spirit of Dr. King's service in all they do today. #MLKDay2015	10152617870588862

87490183861	49 years ago today, President Johnson put pen to paper and signed the final page of this bill, the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I'm proud to have supported this landmark legislation, and I will continue to lead the fight for equal rights for all. A recent Supreme Court decision to gut major sections of the Voting Rights Act is nothing short of a supreme failure in protecting the rights of ALL to vote, no matter the color of their skin. Congress MUST act to right this wrong.	10152266725228862
87490183861	My good friend and colleague, Congressman Gary Peters, introduced legislation this week to reauthorize the State Small Business Credit Initiative.  I helped author the original SSBCI, which has been a resounding success.  SSBCI helped Michigan businesses leverage almost $380 million in private loans against $79 million in federal funds and create or save approximately 6,000 jobs. I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of Gary Peters's important bill and hope my colleagues in the House and Senate will consider and pass it without delay.	10152084084428862

206947066849	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\n\nIn Letters, Congressman John Conyers, Jr. Enlists President Obama, HHS Secretary & Detroit Water and Sewage Dept. Director to Stop Water Shutoffs & Protect Detroiters\n\n(DETROIT) – Today, Congressman John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) sent three letters - to President Obama, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell, and Sue McCormick, Director and Chief Executive Office of the Detroit Water and Sewage Department - requesting immediate federal action and local relief for the water crisis impacting thousands of Detroiters. Copies of the three letters are attached. After the letters were transmitted, Representative Conyers issued the following statement:\n\n“Since March, water service for up to 3,000 Detroit customers per week has been cut off due to an overzealous and misguided approach to cost-cutting by the Detroit Water and Sewage Department. As water rates have skyrocketed 119 percent over the past decade, upwards of 90,000 largely impoverished households are currently in arrears and in danger of termination. Regardless of the rationale for these cutoffs, the human consequences are unacceptable and unsustainable. The failure to reinstate water service means unsanitary conditions, malnutrition and disease for babies, the sick, and the elderly,” said Conyers.\n\n“The time for action is now. Throughout the past week I have worked with local residents, state and federal officials to resolve this crisis; today I am taking this issue to the highest levels – by sending letters to President Obama, HHS Secretary Burwell, and Detroit Water and Sewage Department Director McCormick – to stop the shutoffs and protect Detroiters. Specifically, I wrote urging the following actions be taken immediately:\n\n> Calling on President Obama to make available for relief some of the $200 million still available for Michigan from the Hardest Hit Fund - a reserve made available for relief from impacts of the Great Recession\n\n> Requesting that HHS Secretary Burwell formally designate the water crisis a public health emergency eligible for direct federal relief\n\n> Urging an immediate end to the shutoffs by the Detroit Water and Sewage Department\n\n“In the 21st Century - in the wealthiest nation on earth - no one should ever go without safe, clean water. These steps are just the beginning, as we work determinedly to ensure that this crisis is resolved and never repeated.”\n\nWenonah Hauter, Executive Director of Food & Water Watch added: “We applaud Representative Conyers for taking action to demand that water service is restored to all Detroit residents. When 45 percent of the city struggles to pay for water in their home, it is clear that the problems go far beyond delinquent payments. It’s indicative of broader, systemic issues resulting from decades of bad public policy that have culminated in profits before people. Governor Snyder should act to ensure that all residents have their water restored--access to safe, clean, affordable water is a human right.”\n\n###	10152170896401850
206947066849	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\n\nConyers, Wilson, & Kaptur Host Brain Trust on Long-Term Unemployment As Congress Turns a Blind Eye\n\n(WASHINGTON) – This afternoon, the Congressional Full Employment Caucus held a panel discussion on the ongoing employment crisis in America, entitled “Bipartisan Solutions to Long-Term Unemployment.” The event - moderated by Arthur Delaney with the Huffington Post - featured esteemed panelists including: Betsey Stevenson, a Member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors; Judy Conti, Federal Advocacy Coordinator with the National Employment Law Project; and Heidi Shierholz, an Economist at the Economic Policy Institute. During the course of the discussion, panelists identified proven bipartisan solutions - that Congress can consider and pass immediately - to combat the ongoing employment crisis in the United States and get Americans back to work.\n\nAt the conclusion of the panel discussion, Representatives John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.), Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.), and Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) issued the following statement:\n\nRepresentative John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.): “The unemployment rate has declined at an unacceptably slow pace in the half-decade since the financial crisis. More than 3.4 million currently-unemployed people have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer, excluding the untold number of individuals who have become discouraged and dropped out of the workforce. I co-founded the Congressional Full Employment Caucus this year so that Congress focuses on the widespread unemployment crisis. Having a job is not only essential for having a home and having healthcare. It is essential for enjoying a life of basic stability and dignity. The discussion today not only shed light on the plight of the long-term unemployed - and the discrimination that they face - but also on the actions Congress can take right away. The greatest danger is that Congress will forget this human tragedy. Today’s panel is the first of several efforts - spearheaded by the new Full Employment Caucus - to restore the focus on jobs and to identify and advocate for lasting solutions to the unemployment crisis.”\n\nRepresentative Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.): “There’s a simple message I’ve been trying to get across since I arrived in Congress: Unemployment is our true deficit. People are suffering. Five years after the onset of the financial crisis, there are still more than eleven million people actively looking for jobs, more than four million who have been jobless for six months or longer, and seven million who have given up looking for work altogether. Nearly 3 million Americans, including more than 130,000 Floridians, have not received their unemployment insurance benefits since December 2013.  Now more than ever, it is important that we support a movement towards full employment by enacting policy that creates jobs and boost wages. The mantra of this Congress must be: Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!”\n\nRepresentative Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio): “Putting Americans back to work is priority number one.  Our unemployment crisis not only hurts those who cannot find work today, but future generations.  We must act now.  The solution could not be more clear.  If we want a strong future, we must invest in our crumbling infrastructure—supporting millions of good jobs modernizing our transportation, energy, and water sectors.  We have the tools to do great things for the American people.  We need the will to act.  I am excited to be leading that charge today.”\n\n###	10152165413626850

206947066849	BREAKING --\n\nConyers Introduces New Legislation to Protect Student Loan Borrowers\n\nAs House Republican Leaders Obstruct Student Loan Relief, Rep. Conyers Joins Democratic Leaders in Fight for Student Loan Fairness\n\n(WASHINGTON) – Today, Congressman John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) introduced H.R.4835, the “Stopping Abusive Student Loan Collection Practices in Bankruptcy Act of 2014.” This legislation curtails ruthless collection tactics used by creditors against borrowers who have taken out student loans and sought bankruptcy relief. In particular, the legislation empowers a bankruptcy judge to award both the costs and attorney’s fees to borrowers in bankruptcy cases where student loan creditors engaged in abusive litigation. This legislation comes on the heels of President Obama’s issuance of an executive order earlier this week that allows nearly 5 million Americans struggling with student loan debt the ability to cap their loan payments at 10 percent of their income starting in 2015. In addition, yesterday afternoon House Democrats moved to force a vote on the House companion bill to Senator Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) “Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act,” after the legislation was blocked in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAfter H.R. 4835 was introduced, Representative Conyers (D-Mich.) issued the following statement:\n\n“With record tuition costs, student loan debt topping $1 trillion nationally, and too few employment opportunities for young Americans, it’s no surprise that our nation’s student borrowers are struggling. As a report in the New York Times revealed in January, even student loans borrowers with terminal illnesses - and who were driven into bankruptcy as a result - have been denied important consumer protections. These mounting challenges have turned into a full-blown crisis; the time is now for the federal government to step in and be a part of the solution,” said Conyers.\n\n“Today, I introduced H.R. 4835, the ‘Stopping Abusive Student Loan Collection Practices in Bankruptcy Act of 2014,’ to ensure basic fairness for student borrowers. Unfortunately, some student loan debt collectors engage in abusive litigation tactics that exponentially drive up the cost of legal representation for a borrower. My legislation allows bankruptcy judges to award attorneys fees in cases where a court determines that a borrower’s student loan debt does not have to be repaid in total, due to an undue hardship on the individual and the creditors’ position in opposing this relief was not substantially justified. By empowering bankruptcy judges to award borrower’s attorney’s fees in cases, my legislation will help put a stop to creditors taking advantage of student loan borrowers in the courtroom.\n\n“By ensuring basic legal and consumer protections for students, Congress can help save a generation from being mired in student loan debt. As a matter of fairness and personal opportunity, Congress must stand with our students to level the playing field.”\n\n###\n\nThis legislation is supported by the National Consumer Law Center, Inc. on behalf of its low-income clients as well as the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys.	10152140049066850
206947066849	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\n\nHOUSE PASSES Congressman John Conyers, Jr. AMENDMENT TO FULLY FUND CENTER TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS\n      \n(WASHINGTON) – Late yesterday evening, the U.S. House of Representatives considered H.R. 4745, the “Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act of 2015.” During consideration of the legislation, Congressman John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) offered an amendment to fully fund the Homeless Data Analysis Project (HDAP). The HDAP is the federal government’s leading center for data collection and dissemination of best practices for combating homelessness. This program has been located within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) since 2001. Despite initial reservations by conservative Members, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the amendment unanimously. After the amendment was adopted, Representative Conyers issued the following statement:\n\n“In the aftermath of the nationwide housing crisis of 2008, millions of Americans lost their homes through no fault of their own. In the worst cases - yet regrettably all too often - these struggling individuals wound up in shelters or found themselves living on the streets. It is unthinkable that more than a million people struggle with the scourge of homelessness in the world’s most prosperous nation. In an effort to help repair this shameful state, I offered an amendment - unanimously approved by the House of Representatives - that fully funds the Homeless Data Analysis Project (HDAP). This vote was a win for America’s most vulnerable people, and an acknowledgment by Congress that homelessness is not only corrosive to individual lives but also to our national character,” said Conyers.\n\n“In 2001, Congress directed the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to ‘take the lead on data collection’ on homelessness, the result of which was the HDAP. This program provides critical resources to communities to improve data collection, reporting, and integration of data collection efforts with other federal funding streams. Over the past decade, this project has allowed HUD and other agencies to move away from using largely anecdotal and often inconsistent evidence to using quality data for policy decisions. Better data means better outcomes for the most vulnerable Americans.\n\n“With more than 19,000 individuals - including nearly 4,000 children - homeless in the Detroit area at some point over the course of a year, we have a moral obligation to act. By fully funding homeless assistance grants, and data coordination programs to wisely administer such funding, we can help make the dream of ending homelessness a reality.”\n\n###	10152136831786850
206947066849	PRESS RELEASE\n\nConyers Receives the Owen Bieber Award at UAW Constitutional Convention\n\n(DETROIT) – Today, the United Auto Workers (UAW) held their 36th Constitutional Convention at Cobo Center to approve organizational changes and elect new union leadership. At the convention, Congressman John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) delivered opening remarks and was honored with the Owen Bieber Social Activist Award for his years of public service dedicated to advancing labor rights. The award is named for former UAW leader, Owen Bieber, who served as President from 1983 to 1995. After receiving the award, Representative Conyers issued the following statement:\n\n"I am honored to have helped open the 36th United Auto Workers Constitutional Convention and to receive such a significant award. I am grateful for the UAW’s recognition, but more importantly I am thankful for their decades of tireless commitment to America’s workers and their families,” said Conyers.\n\n“From an early age, my father - who worked as a UAW organizer - instilled in me the values of labor and standing up for workers’ rights. I was just a young boy when my father fought to organize the Ford plant and suffered at the hands of their security forces at the Battle of the Overpass. From my very first days in Congress, I carried these memories with me and was inspired by my father’s teachings. Our fight for justice must continue to extend to the workplace, to afford all workers a sense of dignity and fairness.\n\n“The UAW is proud to have helped build the great city of Detroit, and with it the American middle class. The economic downturn of the last several years presented a fresh challenge to organized labor, but the fundamental promise of collective bargaining remains the same. Through a renewed commitment to full employment, we can once again restore the American economy and build a better future for everyone.”\n\n###	10152122533666850

After learning of her passing, Congressman John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) released the following statement honoring Dr. Angelou’s life and legacy:\n\n“I was deeply saddened to learn that Dr. Maya Angelou passed away earlier today. Her contribution to our country - and, in particular, her ability to help us remember joy in moments of national turmoil - cannot be overstated. Her work inspired my own, and I take heart in knowing that both her art and her advocacy will continue to enrich the lives of so many,” said Conyers.\n\n“A student of life, Dr. Angelou taught herself skills that led to her career as a revered poet, distinguished professor, and loving mother. Her autobiography ‘I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings’ has brought hope and wisdom to countless individuals as they persevere through life’s many challenges. Dr. Angelou was a fierce champion of equality and fairness throughout her advocacy, and was a passionate supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. Undoubtedly, Dr. Angelou has cemented her place in America’s history and will be forever remembered through her work and teachings.”\n\n###	10152112178346850

206947066849	Congressman John Conyers, Jr. & Congressman Bobby Scott:\n"OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S CLEMENCY INITIATIVE A BUILDING BLOCK IN MEANINGFUL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM"\n\n(WASHINGTON) – Today, Department of Justice Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole announced six criteria the Department of Justice will consider when reviewing and expediting clemency applications - for President Obama’s review and approval- from a select group of non-violent individuals behind bars. These petitions will be prioritized for review over other clemency petitions that do not require all six criteria. In addition to announcing the new head of the Office of the Pardon Attorney, Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to increase the numbers of attorneys, with backgrounds in both prosecution and defense, to aid the permanent staff of the Pardon Office during this initiative. After the public announcements, U.S. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (D-Va.) issued the following statement:\n\n“For far too long, America’s criminal justice system and policies have tipped the scales of justice in favor of slogans and sound bites over commonsense. This approach has locked away our youth and torn apart families; a disproportionate number of which are within minority communities. As a matter of civil rights and basic justice, the Obama Administration has decided to stem the tide on decades of this injustice. The Department of Justice’s decision to expand and expedite the clemency process has the potential to assist thousands of non-violent offenders serving lengthy sentences behind bars who would not be serving such lengthy terms under sentencing laws today. This action builds on the progress that the Judiciary Committee began, in the 111th Congress, in passing the Fair Sentencing Act to reduce the arbitrary disparity in drug sentencing.”\n\n“We commend President Obama for taking this historic first step, but in doing so we also call on Congress to lead the way for the United States to see lasting criminal justice reform. While clemency attempts to fix our broken system of mandatory sentencing on the back end - providing relief to a lucky individual plucked from the stack of petitions - it does not repair the unjust system that put thousands of individuals there in the first place. Congress must work to eliminate or greatly reduce mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, and enhance judge’s discretion to avoid disproportionate sentences when mandatory minimums are charged. Again and again studies show that mandatory sentences discriminate against minorities, are ineffective at preventing crime, are inefficient from a cost perspective, and often require judges to impose sentences that violate commonsense. For these reasons, we have a moral obligation to put an end to mandatory sentencing and pass laws with proportional penalties that make sense. Only then will justice truly be restored to an American criminal system gone awry.”\n\n###\n\nhttp://bobbyscott.house.gov/press-releases/conyers-scott-obama-administrations-clemency-initiative-a-building-block-in-meaningful-criminal-justice-reform/	10152046934231850

206947066849	Today, I sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke expressing my concerns about too-big-to-fail banks investing in public assets and critical sectors in our economy.  Here's the letter:\n\nThe Honorable Ben Bernanke\nChairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20551\n\nDear Chairman Bernanke,\n\nWe write in regards to the expansion of large banks into what had traditionally been non-financial commercial spheres. Specifically, we are concerned about how large banks have recently expanded their businesses into such fields as electric power production, oil refining and distribution, owning and operating of public assets such as ports and airports, and even uranium mining.  \n \nHere are a few examples. Morgan Stanley imported 4 million barrels of oil and petroleum products into the United States in June, 2012. Goldman Sachs stores aluminum in vast warehouses in Detroit as well as serving as a commodities derivatives dealer. This “bank” is also expanding into the ownership and operation of airports, toll roads, and ports. JP Morgan markets electricity in California. \n \nIn other words, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley are no longer just banks – they have effectively become oil companies, port and airport operators, commodities dealers, and electric utilities as well. This is causing unforeseen problems for the industrial sector of the economy. For example, Coca Cola has filed a complaint with the London Metal Exchange that Goldman Sachs was hoarding aluminum. JP Morgan is currently being probed by regulators for manipulating power prices in California, where the “bank” was marketing electricity from power plants it controlled. We don’t know what other price manipulation could be occurring due to potential informational advantages accruing to derivatives dealers who also market and sell commodities. The long shadow of Enron could loom in these activities.\n \nAccording to legal scholar Saule Omarova, over the past five years, there has been a “quiet transformation of U.S. financial holding companies.” These financial services companies have become global merchants that seek to extract rent from any commercial or financial business activity within their reach. They have used legal authority in Graham-Leach-Bliley to subvert the “foundational principle of separation of banking from commerce”. This shift has many consequences for our economy, and for bank regulators. We wonder how the Federal Reserve is responding to this shift.\n \nIt seems like there is a significant macro-economic risk in having a massive entity like, say JP Morgan, both issuing credit cards and mortgages, managing municipal bond offerings, selling gasoline and electric power, running large oil tankers, trading derivatives, and owning and operating airports, in multiple countries. Such a dramatic intertwining of the industrial economy and supply chain with the financial system creates systemic risk, since there is effectively no regulatory entity that can oversee what is happening within these sprawling global entities.\n \nOur questions are as follows:\n \n1)      What is the Federal Reserve’s current position with respect to allowing Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to continue trading in physical commodities and holding commodity-related assets after the expiration of the statutory grace period during which they, as newly registered bank holding companies, must conform all of their activities to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956? What is the legal justification for this position?\n \n2)      Has the Federal Reserve been investigating the full range of risks, costs, and benefits – to the national economy and broader society – of allowing these institutions (and, possibly, other large financial holding companies) to engage in trade intermediation and commercial activities that go far beyond pure financial services?  If so, please share the results of your investigation. If not, why not?\n \n3)      What types of data do you collect about the regulated financial holding companies’ non-financial activities? How does the Federal Reserve interact with non-bank regulators who are in charge of overseeing the areas and markets in which banking institutions conduct their non-financial activities?\n \n4)      How do your examiners review, monitor, and evaluate banking organizations' management of potential conflicts of interest between their physical commodity businesses and their derivatives trading?\n \n5)      If such an entity were to become insolvent, what complications are likely to arise in resolving a company with such a range of activities? Please share your analysis on the implications of resolution authority on the commercial activities of systemically important financial institutions. Please describe how these banks approach this issue in their resolution plans (or “living wills”).\n \n6)      When your examiners work within these large institutions, what framework do they use to, say, consider the possibility that a bank run could ensue from a massive public oil spill by a Goldman Sachs-owned oil tanker or a nuclear accident at a plant owned by a bank?\n \n7)      Does this relatively new corporate structure contribute to the likelihood of industrial supply shocks?\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \n \nSincerely,\n \nAlan Grayson\nRaul Grijalva\nJohn Conyers \nKeith Ellison	10151497738211850

By providing shelter, and a corresponding network of support for its members to transition to independent living, Alternatives For Girls helps women who are struggling with abuse, homelessness, and drug use. \n\nI commend the Department of Health and Human Services for recognizing the exceptional, critical work of Alternatives For Girls, and I thank the organization for its selfless work to improve the lives of our neighbors in need.	10151406721591850
206947066849	Republicans in the House of Representatives just blocked my attempt to bring up my one-sentence sequester repeal bill, H.R. 900, for an immediate vote.  \n\nThese cuts are currently diminishing our nation’s educational quality and research output, while leaving us with more untreated mental illnesses, more hunger, more homelessness, and fewer federal criminal prosecutions. The sequester means we will have 2,100 fewer inspections to ensure the safety of our food supply this year.  As the House adjourns today, we do so knowing that thousands of low-income and special needs kids enrolled in Head Start are currently being kicked out of the program. \n\nThis is unacceptable.

This legislation would eliminate that five-year waiting period and allow veterans to seek treatment for mental illnesses stemming from service, regardless of when their conditions arise.\n\nIt is an appalling figure, yet unfortunately 22 veterans commit suicide every single day. Sixty years after the Department of Veterans Affairs was established, it is time for Congress to renew its commitment to providing the men and women who served our nation - from Detroit and all across the country - with the healthcare services they earned.\n\nCurrently the VA provides healthcare treatment and services to veterans who suffer from service-related mental or physical disabilities. Typically, the diagnosis of physical injuries is made before or shortly after separation from the military. However, mental illnesses may not arise until years later. In addition, some serious mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder were virtually undiagnosed in veterans of conflicts prior to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAs the United States armed forces and the VA continue to improve treatment for those who served, there remains a gap for veterans struggling with mental illnesses. Fortunately, the"Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act" will go a long way towards ensuring that the services and treatments relating to mental health that are available to recently discharged veterans are also made available to all who served.	10151397226611850
770135879667732	Today we pause in honor of the 71st anniversary of D-Day. This day is always especially moving and special for me as my father, 1st Lieutenant John Kline, U.S. Army, landed on Omaha Beach on D-Plus 1.\n\nMy father survived, but many of his friends did not. Today we honor our fallen heroes who never returned from Normandy in service of a grateful nation.	1068056369875680

770135879667732	Today on the #NationalDayofPrayer, I ask you to join me in praying for our brave men and women in uniform and our great country. This year's verse is I Kings 8:28, “Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence this day.”	1048219668526017
770135879667732	This week is #CharterSchoolsWeek. Aspen Academy Charter School and Global Academy are two of Minnesota's charter schools I've had the pleasure of visiting recently. Minnesota is the birthplace to the charter school.	1047412661940051
770135879667732	Yesterday, we saw that our economic growth slowed to a near halt – unacceptable for those I represent. Minnesotans expect their representatives in Congress to serve as responsible stewards of taxpayer money, and earlier this evening the House passed a budget that balances, grows our economy, and fosters a more efficient and effective government. I was pleased to support this balanced budget in order to advance the solutions Americans deserve and support a healthier, stronger economy	1045265888821395
770135879667732	I enjoyed participating in the Minnesota delegation hotdish competition yesterday. While my "Not Your Congressional Pork Barrel Biscuit" hotdish (featuring Lloyd's BBQ sauce) didn't take first place, I enjoyed getting together with my colleagues and having a taste of home.	1041091259238858
770135879667732	On Wednesday, I will be leading a hearing to examine the federal bureaucracy governing Bureau of Indian Education schools. Sadly, there are significant health and safety hazards at many American Indian education facilities across the country. The federal government has made a commitment to American Indian students and families to provide educational opportunities in a manner that preserves their culture, language, and traditions, and I will continue to work to ensure we meet this commitment.

770135879667732	This week the House is voting on several important bills every taxpayer should know about including a taxpayer bill of rights, a bill to make political targeting a fireable offense, legislation that gives taxpayers the right to know the status of investigations that may include personal information, and a bill that would allow organizations to declare their tax-exempt status rather than wait for bureaucratic approval.	1035601063121211
770135879667732	I recently returned from a Congressional Delegation (CODEL) trip that included stops in the UK, Jordan, Iraq, Saudia Arabia, and Israel to hear from our allies about the spread of ISIS and Iran's rising influence in the region. During our stop in Iraq, I appreciated hearing from our men and women in uniform.	1030364250311559
770135879667732	The House has acted once again to deliver a realistic balanced budget that reflects the needs of the American people and ensures our national defense. It is important for Minnesotans to know their taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely and I am pleased to have supported a budget that does just that.	1023285624352755
770135879667732	It's always great to meet with Minnesotans who are in DC. This morning I enjoyed hearing from law enforcement from around that state who are representatives of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association.	1019605501387434
770135879667732	Happy #NationalAgricultureDay. Agriculture is a rich tradition in our state with nearly 75K family farms covering more than 26 million acres. Thank you to all of those in the farming community for all you do for our state and the nation.	1019203408094310
770135879667732	Today I questioned Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Dunford, about the events and decisions that led U.S. Marines to be ordered to disarm while assigned to protect the U.S. Ambassador to Yemen and other embassy personnel prior to boarding a commercial aircraft during their evacuation.

770135879667732	I attended today's Supreme Court oral arguments in the King v. Burwell case which challenges the legality of subsidies provided under Obamacare. The President's health care law's implementation has been one problem after another, and today’s case underscores just how far beyond the law the Administration has gone to prop up this fatally flawed plan. There is a better way.	1011412688873382

770135879667732	As many of you know, next week is Christmas. In anticipation of this, and as the U.S Capitol Tree is from Minnesota, my office had a Christmas tree from Cambridge, MN on display in my office. For those who weren't in D.C. to see my tree I'm posting the pictures here.\n\nIn addition to the tree, handmade ornaments from Minnesota schools, Boy Scouts, community events, and county fairs were provided to decorate the tree.	964815070199811

128558293848160	Attended two important events this morning:\n\nFirst, the Stop the Trafficking 5K Run in Eden Prairie where they are raising awareness for what needs to be done to stop the horrific crime of sex trafficking. Proceeds from the race will go to local advocacy groups.\n\nThe second event was the dedication of the Minnesota Military Family Tribute at the state capitol. This memorial -- the first of its kind in the U.S. -- will honor the family members of our troops who often make countless sacrifices while their loved ones serve our country.	835501116487204
128558293848160	Joined my colleagues at a signing by Speaker Boehner of important anti-trafficking bills. The legislation, including a bill I authored, now heads to the President's desk.	824034817633834

128558293848160	Students from Edina's Valley View Middle School stopped by the Capitol today, a very engaged group that asked me a number of thoughtful questions. Of course, they had a lot of fun as well.	821451634558819
128558293848160	My statement regarding the today's passage in the House of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act which ensures any potential nuclear deal with Iran would be subject to Congressional review:\n\n“Congress is united in its understanding that a nuclear Iran poses a threat to the United States, Israel, and stability in both the Middle East and around the globe. Any potential deal negotiated by the Administration should be fully reviewed by the legislative branch to ensure it’s consistent with American interests both now and into the future.”	821430537894262
128558293848160	The Don't Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act, legislation I authored to ensure death benefits of public safety officers killed in the line of duty aren't taxed, just passed the Senate with no opposition. It now heads to the President's desk!\n\nThank you to all of our police officers, firefighters, and EMTs that keep our communities safe.	821399174564065
128558293848160	As part of National Police Week, the House is voting tomorrow on my legislation to protect the death benefits of police officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty from being taxed by the IRS. The Don't Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act makes clear that federal and state death benefits for public safety officers killed on the job are not subject to federal income tax. Families of officers that have given the ultimate sacrifice have seen long delays due to ambiguity in the tax code. The men and women that keep our communities safe -- and their loved ones -- deserve better.	820450517992264

128558293848160	Yesterday was my "Education Day" in Minnesota. I started out the day reading to 1st graders at Excelsior Elementary and letting them know about how Congress works. After that, I met with superintendents from six local school districts to talk about education policy and how my office can be of service. I ate lunch with students at Shirley Hills Elementary in Mound before heading to meet the robotics teams from Chaska and Chanhassen High Schools. Finally, the day finished with a reception for the Congressional Art Competition at the Bloomington Art and Theatre Center to announce the winning piece of art!	815488745155108

128558293848160	My statement on the passage of anti-trafficking legislation in the Senate: \n\n"The Senate did the right thing by setting aside their differences and coming together to protect victims of sex trafficking. Both Republicans and Democrats in the House made combating this crime a priority by approving legislation in the first few weeks of the new Congress. The work isn't done, and we must stay vigilant to ensure that we can protect and help the young girls harmed by human trafficking."	812700412100608

7997462059	Here are some FACTS about the Trade Act: when H.R. 1314 hits the president's desk, the $700 million and $250 million Medicare cuts WILL BE in the bill. The money in the TAA bill on the floor today is BELOW the amount President Obama's Department of Labor requested this year. \n\nA vote for any part of the Trade Act is a vote to cut Medicare. Period.	10152902568777060

128558293848160	Today's vote to pass a permanent 'Doc Fix' in the House gives certainty to doctors and sets us on the path to protect Medicare access for future generations. My statement on the vote:\n\n“Minnesotans want to see a Washington that puts aside politics and isn’t afraid to tackle the big issues. Passing a permanent ‘Doc Fix’ means Congress will no longer have to find annual band-aid solutions to this self-imposed crisis that threatens access for seniors and provides uncertainty for doctors. This bipartisan action makes sure that Medicare is protected for current beneficiaries while taking the necessary steps to ensure the program will be there for our children and grandchildren.”	800555606648422
128558293848160	My statement on the speech to a joint meeting of Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \n\n"The Prime Minister’s powerful speech before Congress gave moral clarity to the threats that a nuclear Iran presents to Israel, the Middle East, and the United States. Since negotiations began, Iran has gone out of its way to push boundaries and avoid transparency at all costs. We can’t allow Iran the capability to develop nuclear weapons. We must stand with Israel to ensure the security of its people."	790585264312123
128558293848160	I joined a broad, bipartisan group of my colleagues in approving the Keystone XL Pipeline today. The bill now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law. The State Department says building the pipeline will support 42,000 American jobs and add $3.4 billion to the economy.\n\nMy statement on today's passage:\n\n“After six years of obstruction and delays, it’s time to build the Keystone pipeline. This pipeline is better for the environment, safer for our communities, and more cost effective than shipping by rail. I encourage the President to sign this legislation into law so we can get started on this important infrastructure project.”	782428315127818

128558293848160	I introduced legislation with my colleagues this week to require a warrant for law enforcement to search through old emails. Currently, one is not needed for emails over 6 months old. Congress hasn't updated email protections since 1986! \n\nTo put this in perspective, the last time we updated our email protections:\n\n-Kiss by Prince was #1 on the Billboard charts.\n-Top Gun was the highest grossing movie.\n-The Minnesota Timberwolves didn't exist.\n-And I looked like this:	779931662044150
128558293848160	Glad to hear that the Senate passed the Clay Hunt SAV Act today to improve veteran mental health services and suicide prevention programs to help our American heroes once they return home. I was a cosponsor of this legislation in the House, where it passed last week. With an estimated 22 veterans per day taking their own life, action must be taken to stop this crisis.	779191688784814
128558293848160	My statement on tonight's State of the Union address:\n\n"I agree with the President that this is an opportune time to turn the page and work together to find solutions to America’s biggest challenges. Congress will remain focused on building a healthier economy that results in more jobs and bigger paychecks for hardworking families, and I urge the President to join us in this effort. From an ambitious trade agenda to a fairer, flatter tax code, we have an opportunity to find common ground that will provide real results for millions of Americans looking for financial security.”	773616199342363
153386471383393	Tomorrow, the House Appropriations Committee will mark up the $30.17 billion FY16 Interior and Environment Appropriations bill. I am the Ranking Member on the Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, which provides funding for our National Parks, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and various arts and humanities programs. The bill before the committee will be impossible for me to support. It has some minor increases in funding for investments in our National Parks and for schools and hospitals in Indian Country – which I was glad to see. However, all of these increases are paid for by drastic cuts to environmental protections – most notably programs to ensure that Americans have access to clean water, including drinking water.\n\nThe cuts in this bill to the Environmental Protection Agency amount to a war on clean water. Families in California are in the midst of a drought and communities in North Carolina and West Virginia are just a few months removed from seeing their water contaminated by pollution. The need to protect access to clean water systems in this country is as pressing as ever. This bill slashes more than $580 million in funding from the EPA’s Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water state revolving loan funds– programs that have garnered praise for their effectiveness from former Republican Governors like Sarah Palin and Jeb Bush. Since 1989, Minnesota has received more than $1B in funding from these programs to help communities build storm water and drinking water infrastructure systems. The bill also has riders that further limit the EPA’s ability to enforce current water protections and it trims funding for Brownfield restoration and economic development programs.\n\nThis bill does include some long-overdue investments in critical areas. We are making strides forward on funding for Native American schools and hospitals which have been woefully underfunded. The National Parks Service received some of the funding necessary to proceed on repairs and operations coinciding with their centennial next year, but the bill still places them $381 million below the President’s request. A small increase to the Bureau of Land Management would also allow them to continue their good work.\n\nHowever, the deep cuts to clean water funding are simply an unacceptable way to pay for these increases. Clean drinking water is an essential human need. If people do not have access to clean drinking water, our other investments will not have the same impact. An increase in funding for our parks means very little if the water that flows through them is polluted. The public health gains from a new hospital for a tribal nation are mitigated if their water supply is contaminated. This is simply not a trade I am willing to make.\n\nI hope that we are able to improve this bill during tomorrow’s markup process. We must find a way to pay for these long overdue investments that does not jeopardize public health.	865506726838027
153386471383393	All of our women and men in the military sacrifice a great deal in order to serve our country.  They are separated from their families for long lengths of time and are asked to perform dangerous and selfless tasks.  However, on Memorial Day each year we take time to pause and recognize the members of our Armed Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice and given their lives in service our nation. \n\nIn recent years, our nation has ended our war in Iraq and is nearing the end of our longest conflict in Afghanistan.  The war in Iraq took the lives of 68 brave Minnesota soldiers and the conflict in Afghanistan cost us another 29 Minnesota lives.  These women and men were our friends, family members, and neighbors. We owe their families and their loved ones the utmost gratitude and support.\n\nFor generations to come Americans will honor the commitment and dedication of the women and men who serve in the United States military.  All of those who have served in our Armed Forces deserve our respect and most sincere gratitude.  On Memorial Day we take time to honor those who gave their lives in service on those critical missions and recognize the sacrifice they have made.  My thoughts and prayers are with all of those in Minnesota who are mourning the loss of a friend, family member or loved one this Memorial Day.	853975074657859
7997462059	I'm marching in Minnesota today because grassroots action is the best way to get our leaders to act and stop the worst effects of climate change.	10152891185042060
7997462059	Yesterday President Obama nominated Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Wilhemina Wright to serve on the United States District Court for Minnesota. Judge Wright's 15 years on the court and her commitment to public service prove she is an excellent candidate for this nomination. She will also bring much needed diversity to Minnesota's federal judiciary.Judge Wright is the first black woman to sit on the bench of Minnesota's Supreme Court and would be Minnesota's first black female federal judge. We need leaders in the criminal justice system who reflect the communities they serve. I look forward to offering my support during the confirmation process.	10152781000547060
153386471383393	This week is National Infrastructure Week, which could not be timed more perfectly this year as we face big choices about what kinds of roads, bridges and transit we need.  At the end of this month, authorization of the federal Highway Trust Fund will expire.  In a few months, that trust fund will run out of money all together if Congress does not act.  In Minnesota, the legislative session is winding down, and legislators in St. Paul are debating what our state transportation bill should look like. \n\nInvesting in our nation’s infrastructure is critical to our future economic success, and I will join my colleagues Rep. Nolan, Rep. Walz, Rep. Ellison in working to pass a Highway Trust Fund Reauthorization through Congress this spring.  \n\nCongress urgently needs to put transportation funding back on solid footing and – I strongly believe – we need to significantly increase our investments.\n\nOur region and our economy need the certainty of a full federal transportation authorization that includes transit.  And we must solve the biggest challenge facing this country’s transportation system – funding.  \n\nAll Minnesotans deserve safe roads, bridges and transit.  This should be an easy choice for my colleagues in Congress.  Rarely do I find an issue where there is so much agreement on the course of action that should be taken.  The business community and the labor community are in agreement that we must reauthorize the Highway Trust Fund and pass a full transportation authorization that allows us to plan and build the infrastructure we need for the future.  Businesses want to be certain that the infrastructure that they need for the future will be there so that they can grow and succeed.  The working men and women of labor know that these kinds of investments in our infrastructure will help to put Minnesotans to work.  \n\nWe must work together to get out of neutral and back into gear.	849293761792657
153386471383393	Today is Equal Pay Day.  When women succeed, we all succeed. Without strong, successful women in every industry in this country, our economy would suffer dramatically. In Minnesota women earn just 80 cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts. This is simply wrong for women and their families. I am proud to support the Paycheck Fairness Act here in Congress, and am disappointed that Republican leadership has not allowed us a vote on the issue.  I will continue to advocate for all working women and their families, until they receive the equal pay they have earned.	836372343084799
153386471383393	Great to see the new Andersen facility in Bayport today. An excellent investment for our state that is creating good jobs for folks like Tony.	832301010158599
153386471383393	Five years ago today, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law and helped change the course of our nation’s health care system for the better.  My colleagues and I worked tirelessly to see that law passed and the President’s signature put in place changes that have benefited our country in countless ways.  \n\nSince the enactment of the ACA, more than 16 million American men, women and children have gained health care coverage.  In Minnesota, 95.1% of the state’s citizens have health care coverage today.  Insurers are no longer allowed to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, impose lifetime caps for coverage, or charge co-pays for recommended preventative care. \n\nWe have already seen the benefits of the Affordable Care Act just 5 years after the President signed it into law. By any measure, families are more secure thanks to the protections afforded by the ACA.  Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress remain dedicated to seeing this law fail – even if that failure comes at the expense of the health of millions of Americans.  They have voted 56 times to repeal, weaken or undermine the Affordable Care Act in spite of its massive successes.  After five years, we must come together to build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work together to further strengthen access to our health care system.	823148927740474
153386471383393	The 2016 federal budget released by Republicans this week would abandon the American middle class.  It would make our country less healthy by taking away health care coverage for over 16 million people and cutting nutrition programs.  It would cut Pell Grants and make it harder for parents to send their children to college. It would raise taxes for hard-working families while protecting corporate tax breaks. While they are making drastic cuts that would hurt the middle class, Republicans want $400 billion in new military spending for weapons and warfare.\n\nOur country is strong when we invest in economic infrastructure, world-class education and hands-on training.  We know that these investments create good, economy-boosting jobs that put more money into the pockets of hard-working American families.  This brings those families closer to the American dreams of owning a home, or sending their children to college.  The Republican budget pushes those dreams further and further out of reach for millions of Americans. \n\nThis Congress needs to work with President Obama to invest in the American people and give them the tools they need to thrive – instead of making drastic cuts to the types of investments that make our economy strong.	820554911333209
153386471383393	Today is International Women’s Day, a time for celebrating the achievements of women and recognizing our ongoing struggle for gender equality. We know that engaging women is a critical component to building a safer, healthier world. Around the world, women are working to confront barriers to education, health, and economic security.   Communities and nations thrive when women are at the table and helping to lead the way. I am excited to see what fantastic discoveries and achievements the next generation of young women and girls will bring to our world.	813340042054696
153386471383393	Today marks the 50th Anniversary of “Bloody Sunday” when brave civil rights marchers set out to walk from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. Led by now-Congressman John Lewis and other civil rights leaders, women and men marched to demand that African-Americans be guaranteed the right to vote. As the protesters were leaving Selma on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were attacked and beaten. \n\nJust a few months after that tragic day, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law.  Today, the Voting Rights Act is under attack.  Provisions protecting the right to vote have been invalidated by the Supreme Court. It is my hope that, as a Congress, we will pass legislation that strengthens the Voting Rights Act, honoring the legacy of all those that were attacked 50 years ago and ensuring the right to vote is protected for future generations.	812454395476594

153386471383393	February marks Black History Month, when we celebrate and remember the tremendous impacts that African American men and women have made on our society. From Civil Rights leaders like my friend and colleague in Congress Rep. John Lewis of Georgia who stood with Martin Luther King, to Minnesota cultural luminaries like Prince and August Wilson, our communities and our country would not be what it is today without the achievements of many great African Americans.  Minnesota was also changed immeasurably by the work of people like Roy Wilkins, Matt Little and Nellie Stone Johnson. \n\n2015 is a year where we can make great strides in ensuring that we remember and honor the history of African Americans in this country year round. In my role on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee here in Congress, we have the responsibility to appropriate the final funding for the Smithsonian’s African American History Museum which is set to open next year. The museum will tell the stories of African Americans throughout our nation’s history. The final $41 million for completion of the museum represents a fantastic investment in helping to keep these stories alive and accessible for future generations. In addition, the President’s FY16 budget proposes funding for a national historical trail from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.  These projects are two examples of ways we can remember the historic contributions of African Americans in this country throughout the year. I will work to see that both of those projects receive the funding they need to be completed and will continue to support funding for initiatives that lift up the important contributions that African-American women and men have made to our nation.	805850196137014
153386471383393	I am thrilled that His Holiness Pope Francis has accepted an invitation to address a joint session of Congress on September 24th.  As a Catholic, I have been so impressed by the refreshing new voice that Pope Francis has brought to the church.  His Holiness' advocacy for human rights and the respect he gives to the poor and marginalized are inspiring.  I look forward to hearing from him and my thanks go to both Speaker Boehner and President Obama for their work to make Pope Francis’ visit possible.	799336340121733
153386471383393	Today’s attempt by House Republicans to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act for the fourth time threatens the health and well-being nearly every American without providing any replacement. \n\nInstead of outlining a replacement to the ACA, Republicans want to take away comprehensive health coverage from millions of Americans and repeal critical patient protections.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, people with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied access to care; young adults are able to remain on their parents’ health coverage; families can purchase affordable health coverage on the health insurance exchanges; and seniors are receiving real help with their prescription drug costs as we eliminate the Part D donut hole.   \n\nMy constituents have made it clear that the ACA is helping to improve their family’s health and economic security.   Republicans are once again voting to strip away all of the protections and benefits that the ACA provides. The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land and it is time for Republicans to stop focusing on repealing and undermining it. Instead, I am interested in working on passing a budget that protects and strengthens the middle class.	798382243550476
153386471383393	Yesterday, President Obama introduced a budget proposal that prioritizes investments in education, infrastructure construction, workforce development, and national security. His plan would reduce the federal budget deficit, end mandatory across the board budget cuts, and increase taxes on the profits of multinational corporations and the wealthiest Americans. \n\nPresident Obama sent Congress a plan that is focused on strengthening the economy for middle class Americans while reducing the federal deficit and investing in rebuilding our infrastructure. I strongly support ending across the board budget cuts – sequestration – which is stopping lifesaving health research and damaging the preparedness of our servicemen and women. This is a budget that raises taxes on foreign profits to pay for infrastructure here at home that will create jobs and strengthen our economy. \n\nAs the congressional budget process moves forward, I will work with the President and my Democratic colleagues to protect the middle class. I am very concerned that Tea Party Republicans will threaten retirement security for our seniors and make cuts to critical investments for our children, our environment, and our economy. Such an abandonment of middle-class priorities needs to be rejected by Democrats and, if necessary, vetoed by President Obama.\n\nIt is my hope that Republicans and Democrats will work together to end sequestration and pass appropriations bills for fiscal year 2016 that put the needs of middle class Americans, our economy, and our national security ahead of any partisan agenda.	798242633564437
153386471383393	Today, I joined 45 of my colleagues as an original co-sponsor of the International Human Rights Defense Act.  We have made important strides towards equality in Minnesota and throughout the United States over the last several years.  However, there are still too many places where lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are not afforded their basic human rights - and that is wrong.  The legislation introduced today would direct the State Department to make the human rights of LGBT people a U.S. foreign policy priority and require the development of a global strategy to help achieve this goal.	794971077224926
153386471383393	Tonight, President Obama will make very clear that his priority is putting the middle class first.  Building a strong foundation for the middle class must be a priority for this Congress as well.  I will continue my work to advocate for policies that protect middle-class families in Minnesota and across the country. In past years, I have co-sponsored legislation to enact many of the policies the President has said he will address tonight. The President will give a boost to that work by endorsing investments in infrastructure, middle-class tax cuts, and greater access to higher education in order to support and strengthen middle class families and workers.  \n\nWhile these proposals may not be what Congressional Republicans want to hear, I know it is what the American people want to hear.  Overwhelmingly, families in Minnesota and across our nation support increasing access to higher education, cutting taxes for middle-class families, and granting paid sick and family leave to workers.  \n\nIt is my hope that Congress – both Democrats and Republicans - will work to build an economy focused on the middle class rather than settling into two more years of obstruction.	790350501020317
153386471383393	Today, we honor and remember the legacy of Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. He was one of the finest advocates for equality and social justice our country has ever known and he continues to inspire countless Americans. Dr. King's resolve, perseverance and compassion should guide all of us who continue to work in pursuit of his vision for a more just and equal nation.	789783397743694

153386471383393	This week, the President called on Congress to pass legislation that would allow all American workers to earn up to seven days of paid sick time a year. He also proposed funding that would allow states to develop paid family and medical leave programs. \n\nThese are proposals which have had my support for years in Congress, and all working Americans have reason to be encouraged by the President’s proposal.  Healthy employees are better employees.  Workers cannot do their jobs safely or effectively while they are ill.  If one illness or medical issue could leave them struggling financially, they will not be able to have the peace of mind that all working Americans should earn.\n\nAdditionally, during flu season here in Minnesota we are all too aware of the way that contagious illnesses can be passed.  Employees who come to work sick can infect their co-workers, customers or bosses and cause even more people to become ill.  Unfortunately, without paid sick leave many Americans are forced to choose between caring for themselves and protecting their coworkers or making ends meet.  \n\nMy colleague and friend Rosa DeLauro has worked to pass legislation like this for years here in Congress – which I have always supported.  The President’s support for this legislation is incredibly valuable and will be a great help to those of us working to see paid sick leave legislation become law in this country.	788191684569532
153386471383393	The Keystone XL Pipeline should not be allowed to circumvent a thorough environmental review. Congress voted on this matter less than two months ago, and substantial questions remain in the regulatory and review process.  More than 2.5 million Americans submitted comments on the State Department’s environmental review of the Keystone XL project, and this bill would disregard their concerns. \n \nFurthermore, I see no evidence to suggest that this project merits congressional intervention.  The precedent of forgoing due diligence regarding our nation’s environment for the benefit of a foreign company is irresponsible.  Additionally, this project would bring zero permanent jobs to Minnesota, and as few as 50 nationwide. Trading dubious economic benefits for potentially disastrous environmental consequences is simply not a trade I am willing to make. \n \nI am pleased that President Obama has issued a veto threat should this bill find its way to his desk.  I oppose this bill and the precedent it would set for bypassing essential review processes for political purposes.	784626978259336
153386471383393	The attacks on the press in Paris this week are abhorrent and I stand in solidarity with the people of France as they mourn this tragedy. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of all those affected.  \n\nA press that is free to speak without fear of censorship from political regimes or violence from terrorist extremists is critical to an open society. \n\nPolitical cartoonists are a critical part of a free press and provide some of the most thoughtful and internationally accessible commentaries on our world. As we saw several years ago in Denmark and again yesterday in Paris, sometimes those cartoonists can be the target of violence as a result of their work. It is my hope that the world comes together to stand in support of a free and open press.	783431725045528

153386471383393	Today is a historic day that marks a new beginning in relations between the U.S. and Cuba.  I congratulate President Obama for his efforts to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba and to begin easing the trade restrictions between our countries. I would also like to thank the President for his efforts to secure the release of USAID worker Alan Gross from prison in Cuba.  \n\nWhile traveling to Cuba this past summer, I saw the tremendous opportunities that exist between the people of our two countries to find common ground in pursuit of human rights, in the service of a democratic transformation and economically.  The connections between the American people and the Cuban people are far stronger than any differences. Normalized diplomatic relations will allow us to focus on achieving our shared goals through cooperation and communication – a formula that has served the United States well in nations around the world.  \n\nI will continue to work to end the trade embargo between our two countries as I have done since I came to Congress in 2001.  Ending the embargo and normalizing trade relations is good for Minnesota businesses and good for the people of Cuba.  It is my hope that the politics and politicians in South Florida who have held U.S.- Cuba relations hostage for decades will abandon their Cold War-era policies and join those of us seeking full diplomatic and economic engagement with the Cuban government and its people.   \n\nToday’s news is a fantastic step forward that is long overdue.  President Obama’s leadership on this issue has been extraordinary and will help us foster the expansion of human rights, security and democracy in the Western Hemisphere.	769514519770582

153386471383393	Today, funding for the federal government runs out if we do not pass an appropriations bill or a continuing resolution. I want to vote for a bipartisan appropriations bill that keeps our federal government running because there are a number of things included that I have worked hard to pass. However, I cannot vote for this omnibus bill. Republicans have corrupted the appropriations process by secretly inserting provisions that put Wall Street and billionaires ahead of the middle class. \n \nOur appropriations process should be about making our federal government work in a way that meets the needs of every American.  We spend months debating various bills to determine how best to fund critical programs and services. Republican leadership is ignoring that process by inserting last-minute provisions that give their billionaire political donors a stronger voice in the political process and allow their allies on Wall Street to be bailed out by taxpayers.  Billionaires already play an enormous role in our political process. Today, wealthy donors can give political party committees $97,200 per year.  The provisions in this bill would raise that number to $777,000 per year.  These provisions, which appeared suddenly in the bill overnight, would amplify the voices of a select, wealthy few and allow them to drown out the political influence of middle-class Americans.  This is wrong. \n\nThe bill on the floor today would also put middle-class taxpayers back on the hook for abuses by Wall Street banks. In 2010, I helped pass a bill that would help limit abuses in financial institution and protect taxpayers from having to bail out banks.  That bill included a provision entitled “Prohibition of Federal Government Bailouts of Swaps Entities.” This provision made sure that federal taxpayers would not bailout banks selling credit swaps – one of the most volatile financial products.  Republicans would eliminate that provision, and leave middle-class taxpayers on the hook for bailing out Wall Street again in the future. Then, after gutting language to protect taxpayers from the mistakes of banks, those wealthy bankers would be able to exert greater influence over our nation’s elections and elected leaders. This combination is deeply destructive to our democracy.\n\nWe must pass a bill to keep our government funded.  Giving greater influence to wealthy political donors and more lax restrictions to questionable financial practices has nothing to do with keeping our government open.  These are policy provisions inserted into this bill in the middle of the night, in the hopes that the urgent need to fund our government might overshadow how harmful they are to our country.  \n\nMy job in the House of Representatives is to represent the best interests of the people of Minnesota.  Supporting either of these provisions will benefit billionaires and will harm the people I was elected to serve. I will not support this bill as long as they are included.	766860670035967

7658849357	I voted against arming the so-called "moderate" Syrian rebels. \n\nFor more than three years the President has remained indecisive on whether or not to arm and support the shrinking ranks of ‘moderate’ Syrian rebels who are rapidly aligning with the Islamic State and al Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra. \n\nHis failure to convince the American people, coupled with turning a blind eye to this ongoing conflict, has once again left the United States without any good options. \n\nMany of the so-called ‘moderate’ rebels have already joined the cause of Islamic jihad, and President Obama has failed to coherently outline how he would prevent American weapons from getting into the hands of our enemies.\n\nPresident Obama has the right conclusion – defeating the Islamic State – but a flawed strategy filled with half-measures to reach it. \n\nThe Islamic State declared war against the United States, and President Obama has asked the U.S. Congress to follow him in a Vietnam-style slow walked response. I will not. \n\nEither the United States chooses to decisively defeat this brutal evil with all available resources, or we will have to answer the next generation's questions regarding why we failed to defeat the totalitarian evil of our day.	10153214840899358

7658849357	The leftwing attack machines are at it again, this time distorting my views on Israel. My record is clear: I've always stood unshakably in support of Israel's sovereignty and survival and that will never change. \n \nI am deeply concerned that Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon will be a nightmare for the world. But for Israel and the United States in particular--based upon Iran's clear declaration of intent to annihilate the Jewish state and threats against America--this could mean destruction of the highest order. \n \nThe dangerous P5+1 agreement, which has been pushed by the Obama administration, immediately eases sanctions and allows Iranian enrichment of weapons grade uranium and to maintain nearly all elements of its secret military nuclear program. We should demand a full dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program, nothing less. Preventing a nuclear Iran is a defining issue of our time. There is no second chance once Iran has a nuclear weapon.\n \nEver since I had the remarkable opportunity to live on a Kibbutz in Israel as an 18 year old, I’ve felt a kinship and a sense of home whenever I travel back there. And with so much at stake, I will continue to be outspoken in my love and support for the Jewish state of Israel and our national security.\n \nClick here for some of my recent columns explaining my unwavering support for Israel:\n \nhttp://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Is-the-Obama-administration-condoning-sanctions-and-boycotts-against-Israel-341250\n \nhttp://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Israel-must-never-be-betrayed-335212\n \nhttp://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/US-pressure-and-demands-on-Israel-to-make-concessions-must-stop-330601	10152700537889358

It’s easy to spend, spend, spend when it’s future generations that will have to pick up the tab. But for the sake of children and grandchildren, we need to put the brakes on reckless spending and get America’s fiscal house in order.	10152644926024358
7658849357	It’s a big mistake to push an amnesty bill on behalf of big special interests at the expense of hard working Americans.  With millions of Americans struggling in the Obama economy, our first duty must be to help unemployed American workers and those in low paying jobs. And when you consider President Obama’s utter disregard for the Constitution, there is simply no reason to trust him to enforce the law. It’s time we learn the lessons of 1986 and secure the border first—not grant amnesty first.	10152614982264358
7658849357	Saddened by the loss of former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. He was a tireless defender of Israel and an unwavering friend to the United States. His loved ones are in my prayers.	10152563290509358
7658849357	President Obama’s position of no negotiation took us to the brink of government default to advance his political agenda over the best interests of the American people. Republicans were the adults in the room, offering compromise after compromise and urging the President to come to the table and do what’s right for our country.\n \nPresident Obama may have won an immediate political battle for his radical agenda but it comes at a great cost to the economy, to our health care system, and to the American people. It means we will continue on the same trajectory towards economic decline, skyrocketing national debt, and greater government intrusion in our health care.\n \nAfter an embarrassing two weeks of Obamacare failures, I hope President Obama will soon realize that forcing every American to purchase a health insurance policy that they don’t want at a price they can’t afford from a website that doesn’t work is not a sustainable course of action.\n \nI could not vote for this bill as it does nothing to give relief to the countless Americans hurting under Obamacare, nor does it address our out of control spending and $17 trillion national debt.	10152315933989358
7658849357	The prospect of military intervention in Syria demands a robust public debate, and President Obama made the correct constitutional decision to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force.\n\nI am adamantly opposed to President Obama starting another war in the Middle East and plan to vote against military intervention in Syria. We have bad actors and bad options on both sides in Syria, with many of the rebels working with al Qaeda-affiliated groups. \n\nThe fruit of President Obama’s failed foreign policy has contributed to the chaos and instability in Libya and Egypt, all the while distracting from the essential threat in the Middle East: the specter of a nuclear Iran.\n\nPresident Obama has not demonstrated a vital American national security interest in the conflict in Syria or a clear strategy outlining what the use of force would accomplish. The American people do not support a military intervention and I cannot vote for one.	10152200442854358

388085277945339	Yesterday I joined a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans in Congress – with the support of numerous veterans organizations – to vote against the House funding bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) because it shamefully underfunds programs that provide our veterans with the benefits they have earned in service to our great nation. Joining us in opposition to this legislation are millions of veterans represented by the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and Paralyzed Veterans of America. The fact of the matter is we can and must do better for our heroes than what this bill provides.\n\nThe simple truth is, with 22 veterans committing suicide every day, it is apparent we are FAILING our veterans in America. This measure FAILS to provide the resources necessary to put an end to the backlog that has forced thousands of veterans to wait an absurd amount of time for the care they are immediately entitled to – and has cost many veterans their lives. This bill FAILS to provide the resources to build new veteran health care facilities in order to meet the growing needs of veterans – and it FAILS to allow the VA to maintain the health care facilities that already exist. And finally, this bill FAILS to adequately address the mental and physical health needs of veterans – and most especially the crisis of escalating veteran suicide – scaling back health benefits for roughly 70,000 veterans according to reports from VA Secretary Robert McDonald.\n\nIf we can afford to put our young men and women in harm’s way, then it is our sacred obligation to protect and serve them as they protected and served us. It’s time for the Congress to do more than talk the talk – we need to walk the walk. It’s time for Congress to honor our veterans with action by stepping up and providing the benefits our brave men and women have earned through their service to our country. We owe them nothing less.	797602340326962
388085277945339	By now, you may have heard the news about U.S. Steel’s intention to idle operations at its Minntac plant, leading to the loss of nearly 700 jobs. My first concern is for the workers and their families – and for all the businesses affected most directly by these layoffs. The heart of the matter is that the process of enforcing our trade policies and agreements against the illegal dumping of foreign steel into our marketplace is broken. It’s ineffective. It takes too long. It’s full of loopholes that allow horrific damage to be done before any action can be taken. What’s more, there are no effective tariffs on foreign steel. As a result, our jobs, our economy and our national security are being put at enormous risk. We need to put a stop to unworkable trade agreements and avoid more of these devastating layoffs from happening in the future.\n\nRead my full statement here: http://1.usa.gov/1DnyhQc	781451218608741
388085277945339	This morning, I joined Lt. Governor Tina Smith and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken to meet with top administration officials at the White House in an effort to determine what immediate steps can be taken to stop job losses resulting from declining iron ore prices and unfair dumping of foreign steel. I’m glad the Administration shares our concern and willingness to explore tougher enforcement against illegal trade. The heart of the problem is that enforcement takes too long and there are no tariffs on steel imports – by the time the lengthy and costly process of determining harm from illegal trade is complete, the damage has already been done. The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement will only make this situation worse, and that's why I'm against ramming it through Congress on a 'Fast Track' with no opportunity to amend and improve it.	779387275481802
388085277945339	Minnesota students are some of the smartest, most thoughtful kids you’ll ever meet. It was truly a pleasure to spend time today with classes from Deer River High School and Barnum High School visiting Washington DC. They had some thought-provoking questions for me – and I think we took a year’s worth of selfies.	778432642243932
388085277945339	I have decided to cosponsor Rep. Mike Honda’s Non-Disparagement of Native American Persons or Peoples in Trademark Registration Act – ensuring that racial slurs and derogatory terms are no longer profited from or glorified using federal trademark protections. In addition to working on other critical tribal issues like housing and treaty rights, this bill is an important step towards repairing relationships and establishing respect for our nation’s Native Americans.	748362861917577
388085277945339	The simple truth is, FAIR Trade > Free Trade – and that’s why I’m supporting the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act. Our economy has lost up to five million jobs as a result of currency manipulation by China and other foreign countries. Foreign nations that control the free exchange of currencies give their own exporters an unfair advantage over competitors and weaken America’s manufacturing base. This measure will permit the Commerce Department to treat manipulated exchange rates as export subsidies – giving domestic manufacturers the tools they need to restore jobs and fight back against countries that unfairly subsidize their exports.	773833712703825
388085277945339	Today was International Women’s Day - a day dedicated to celebrating the economic, political and social achievements of women past, present and future.

388085277945339	As the former director of a Head Start Program, I’ve seen how influential those early years are on a child’s future success – preparing them to find a job and join the workforce when they grow up. That’s why I’m cosponsoring a resolution to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Head Start Program. This may seem like a small action, but recognizing the critical importance of these programs is an integral part of protecting them for future generations.	766707070083156

388085277945339	All around the Eighth District, I've heard concerns from veterans who are still unable to access the care they need because they live in remote, rural areas. This is because the VA has only taken into account how far a veteran lives from a VA medical facility – regardless of whether that facility can provide the medical services they need – in its interpretation of the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act’s 40-mile eligibility criteria. In order to help fix the problem, I've joined on as the lead House Democrat in support of a bill requiring the VA to offer access to community care if a veteran lives within 40 miles of a VA medical facility that cannot provide the care they require. In America, nobody should struggle to access care – especially not the brave men and women who have risked their lives to keep the rest of us safe.	760095567410973
388085277945339	I hope you can join me this morning at Baxter City Hall or at 3:00 PM at Duluth City Hall to discuss Minnesota’s transportation needs. As anyone who travels through our region can attest, our highways are falling into disrepair faster than we can fix them. We have a significant opportunity to make progress this year, and I want to be sure we are working together to make our roads and bridges as strong and safe as we possibly can.	755784024508794
388085277945339	Wonderful news for our efforts to improve mental health services for our nation’s veterans – the Clay Hunt SAV Act, which I cosponsored in the House, has passed the Senate and is on its way to the President’s desk. This long overdue legislation provides veterans with improved access to VA suicide prevention and other mental health services.  Authored by my Minnesota colleague Rep. Tim Walz, the bill was named after Clay Hunt, a Marine who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and succumbed to suicide in 2011 after battling depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This measure is an important step in what needs to be a larger nationwide campaign to improve mental health services for all who suffer from these difficult and debilitating conditions, along with their families and care givers.	753284628092067

388085277945339	I'm delighted to announce that the Duluth Transit Authority will receive a grant for $6.3 million from the Federal Transit Administration to replace six diesel buses with six state of the art Proterra 40’ zero emission fast-charge electric buses – plus two on-route fast charge stations. This grant is tremendous news for the City of Duluth and for everyone in the community who uses mass transit. As I told Transportation Secretary Anthony Fox when we began the application process last year, given its long cold winters, Duluth is probably the best city in the nation to demonstrate fast-charging electric bus technology. With this grant, Duluth will lead the way for other cold weather cities looking to incorporate sustainable technologies into their transit systems.	749957921758071

388085277945339	This year, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) implemented lower service standards – delaying mail and hurting businesses, residents, rural communities and the economy. This is unacceptable, so I am currently working with Reps David McKinley and Paul D. Tonko on a resolution in support of restoring USPS service standards. Lowering standards fails to address the real problem: An unnecessary federal requirement to put $5 billion away per year for future retiree benefits. The fact is, this requirement is no longer necessary because the fund now has substantial resources to ensure full retiree health benefits for the foreseeable future. It’s time to restore service standards and get back to the root of the problem.	748350718585458
388085277945339	The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is widely considered one of the most spectacular and remote areas in the world – which is why President Obama has finalized the Comprehensive Conservation Plan to designate the Arctic Coastal Plain as “Wilderness” – bringing with it extra conservation protections. Having cosponsored legislation in both the last Congress and the new Congress to designate this area as Wilderness, I’m pleased to hear that it will now be protected for generations to come.	747730478647482
388085277945339	Having a safe place to call home shouldn’t be an exclusive privilege for the few – it should be affordable and accessible to our region’s hardworking families. My former colleague Mel Watt, now the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, was up on Capitol Hill today to answer questions about his plans for supporting the mortgage market to help lower-income and middle class buyers. In addition to creating millions of good-paying jobs and bringing hundreds of billions of dollars to our economy through the housing industry, affordable housing enables families to settle down and raise their children in a stable home – which is why I’m thankful Director Watt listened to my request to set aside funds for the Capital Magnet Fund and Housing Trust Fund to go towards these activities.	746938612060002
388085277945339	Today, the House will vote on the Clay Hunt SAV Act – legislation to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs’ mental health care and suicide prevention programs and require a pilot program on student loan repayment for psychiatrists who agree to serve in the Veterans Health Administration. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and look forward to voting YES on it tonight.	739607029459827

186908658003781	Today, I voted in support of the Death Tax Repeal Act to eliminate the estate tax that allows double and triple taxation on inherited family assets.  \n \nFamilies work hard to build businesses and have something to leave behind for their loved ones.  It’s morally wrong and crippling to small family businesses.  \n\nRepealing this death tax takes an unnecessary burden off the backs of hardworking, taxpaying Americans who are simply striving for the American Dream.	1021251451236160

186908658003781	This morning we held a ceremony at Camp Shelby honoring Mr. Travis Johnson of Hattiesburg for his years of service to our country. \n\nIt was my privilege to present Mr. Johnson with the Army of Occupation medal with the Germany clasp and the European-African-Middle East Campaign Medal with 3 bronze stars for his service in the 311th Infantry Brigade.\n\nToday’s freedoms were borne on the backs of our military and their selfless sacrifice as well as the sacrifices of their families. I was proud to present these medals and decorations to a fellow soldier and a proud son of Mississippi.	1000713853289920

186908658003781	I strongly oppose long-term funding for DHS that allows the president to move forward with his illegal, unconstitutional amnesty plans. \n\nThe majority of Congress disagrees with his actions, the federal courts disagree with his actions, and the majority of the American people disagree with his actions.\n\nI am disappointed that Senate leadership did not stand strong.  More so, I am beyond frustrated that the president would use the safety of the American people as collateral to protect his unlawful amnesty plan.\n\nThe president has put law-breaking illegal immigrants above law-abiding American citizens.  It’s blackmail, it’s wrong, and it’s not the way we should conduct business or create policy in the United States of America.	995879950439977
186908658003781	The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms, and Explosives is attempting to further Obama’s anti-gun agenda by proposing a ban on certain ammunition.  \n\nAs a lifetime member of the NRA and a sportsmen, a ban on M855 5.56 x 45mm cartridges not only affects me personally but enrages me as a firm supporter and protector of our Second Amendment rights.  \n\nToday, I signed on to a letter to the Director of the BATFE strongly opposing this ammunition ban. The Right to Bear Arms is something our forefathers fought for and something I will continue to fight for.	993835260644446

186908658003781	Today, the House passed a bill to repeal Obamacare.  Since its very inception Obamacare has been bad for individuals, bad for families, and bad for businesses!  \n\nOur bill will finally put an end to the harmful policies that were forced upon the American people by this president and allow us to replace them with conservative, common-sense reforms that provide real solutions.  \n\nNow it’s time for our conservative friends in the Senate to follow through with their end of the bargain and repeal this law!	979547638739875
186908658003781	Yesterday, the Senate voted to pass the Keystone XL pipeline that will create thousands of jobs across our country.

We would not be where we are today if it weren't for the many brave individuals who dedicate their lives to pushing the boundaries of space exploration and discovery.  From Apollo 1 to Columbia to Challenger, these astronauts put themselves in harm's way to better our future. \n\nI join NASA and the American people on this day of remembrance in paying my utmost respects to these outstanding individuals.  Their hard work and commitment forever changed the world, and their sacrifice will not be forgotten.	976136989080940
186908658003781	Last week I had the honor of presenting Columbia resident and World War II Veteran, Lieutenant Lawrence Bean, with the Purple Heart, Bronze Star and Combat Infantry Badge during a ceremony held in his honor.  \n\nLt. Bean fought in the Battle for Luzon, where the United States proved victorious, but at the devastating cost of more than 10,000 dead soldiers and 35,000 wounded.  It was during this battle that Lt. Bean was injured by an enemy grenade.  \n\nI couldn't have been more proud to finally be able to present these well-deserved honors to Lt.

It is unacceptable for the President to release these dangerous men with insufficient measures to prevent them from joining the fight against our military abroad. Releasing these prisoners increases the risk to our military, as well as Americans at home. \n\nIf President Obama is serious about shutting down the facility, then he should put forward an alternate plan and work with Congress to do so.	594821283987883

573002239470919	I have been a longtime supporter of preserving and protecting America's outdoor traditions. That is why I recently cosponsored legislation called the Sportmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act. This bill is a comprehensive piece of legislation that is meant to protect and enhance opportunities for recreational hunting, fishing, and shooting. Some of the key provisions in this package are: prohibiting the EPA from outlawing lead ammunition and fishing tackle; allowing states to increase funding for public shooting ranges; and allowing lawful possession of firearms on Army Corps lands. It is my hope the House brings this bill to the floor soon so we can continue to preserve and advance the sportmen's heritage.	693197974118011
573002239470919	Today, the House of Representatives passed legislation that I sponsored to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in Cedar Hill as the “Sergeant First Class William B. Woods, Jr. Post Office.”\n\n“Sergeant Woods dedicated his life to protecting our great country. Renaming the Cedar Hill Post Office after Sergeant Woods will forever remind us of the dedication with which he served the United States of America and the ultimate sacrifice that he made on its behalf.  It has been a true privilege to sponsor this bill in the House of Representatives and I will continue to work to see it signed into law.\n\nSergeant Woods was a graduate from Northwest High School in Cedar Hill. He first enlisted with the United States Marine Corps in 1996 as a rifleman and he later enlisted in the United States Army where he attended the Special Forces Qualification Course in 2003 and earned the Green Beret. While in the U.S. Army, SFC Woods was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group and deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. \n\nIn 2009, Sergeant Woods died in Germany from wounds sustained while conducting a mounted patrol in Afghanistan. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and two daughters.	692902574147551

573002239470919	Yesterday, Rep. Vicky Hartzler and I held a joint press conference at the Noren Conservation and River Access Area in Jefferson City to discuss the overreaching regulation by the administration known as the Waters of the United States. \n\nRecently, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act was introduced which would give agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 30 days to withdraw the current WOTUS proposal and charges them with developing a new proposed rule. In addition, this legislation would require the federal government to engage in a true federalism outreach process with states and local governments to ensure the new rule properly defines and respects the authority of local government entities. \n\nThe current WOTUS proposal by the EPA is not only an attack on individual rights but also represents a huge encroachment on the rights of states to regulate the waters within their borders. The EPA can try to rebrand and repackage this proposal any way they want, but any reasonable person knows that it will do immense damage to our nation's economy and individual property rights.	671789439592198

573002239470919	“We take the stars from heaven, the red from our mother country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing Liberty.” – President George Washington\n\nOur United States flag was first authorized by the Second Continental Congress on June 14, 1777. This date is now observed as Flag Day throughout our nation, and, on it, we pause to recognize, remember, and give honor to one of our country’s most enduring symbols.\n\nTo me, the flag represents a living example of what it means to be an American. Our flag serves as an inspiration to our nation’s veterans, those currently defending our country, and all Americans who proudly stand tall and raise their hands over their hearts when they recite the Pledge of Allegiance or sing the Star Spangled Banner. \n\nMany of our fellow Americans have made courageous sacrifices to preserve all that our national flag represents. And June 14 serves as a day to remember our loyalty to our great nation and reaffirm our belief in liberty and justice. Across the nation, there will be ceremonies, parades, and services held in communities for all to pay respect to the nation’s flag.\n\nOne service my office offers is the flag program in which residents of the 3rd District can request a flag that has been flown over the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Each year my office receives dozens of requests from Eagle Scouts, veterans, businesses, and families that would like flags to use for ceremonies, display inside, or fly outside. Each flag flown over the Capitol comes with a commemorative certificate identifying the date on which it was flown and the occasion for doing so.  The price of each flag depends on size and material. For more information or to place an order, please call any of my offices or visit my website.\n\nFlag Day exists because the American spirit exists, and I encourage you to take a moment and reflect on what this symbol means to you and to those who defend our country.	691798337591308
573002239470919	As your representative in Congress, I meet with residents of the 3rd District on a daily basis, vote on bills on the House floor, and attend Financial Services and Small Business committee hearings. That’s just a small sample of what I do in the House of Representatives. One facet of this job is not only inspiring, but also something that many people don’t know about: nominating exceptional young people from our district to our nation’s armed service academies.  \n\nI work closely with our district’s Military Academy Advisory Board, made up of academy graduates, veterans, parents, and community leaders in this process, and since 2009, the board has nominated 88 of the brightest and hardest-working individuals. Before these individuals are nominated, the panel first conducts face-to-face interviews with these young folks who wish to serve their country as commissioned officers. \n\nThe four armed service academies are West Point in New York (U.S. Army), the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland (U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps), the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado (U.S. Air Force), and the Merchant Marine Academy in New York (U.S. Merchant Marine). The U.S. Coast Guard does not require congressional nominations. \n\nThe application process for the class of 2020 has officially opened and it is my privilege to invite the young individuals to learn about the admissions process at the academies. The nomination process includes a formal application and applicant interviews with the 3rd District Military Academy Advisory Board. The board then makes recommendations as to which outstanding students should receive nominations, based on the criteria established by the service academies.  Once a nomination is received, an applicant still must be accepted for admission by an academy in order to enroll.\n\nFor those selected from the extremely competitive field of qualified students nationwide, they are in for an incredibly positive life experience. \n\nThe level of candidates for academy nominations seems to get more impressive each year. There are many tough decisions to make by the Military Academy Advisory Board to make final recommendations. I would like to thank each person on the panel for dedicating your time and helping me decide on a final nominating list and I would like to recognize them: Washington Missourian Publisher Bill Miller Sr.; Sheldon Hartsfield, a safety director and retired military; Adam Gresham, a state employee and U.S. Naval Academy graduate; Matt West, on-air host at KJFF radio in Festus; and Julie Boeckmann, a communications specialist at the Missouri Department of Education.\n\nMore information about the academy nomination process can be found on my website and my office will continue to reach out to schools to inform students about the nominating process. I look forward to getting another opportunity to meet these young people in person as they seek the honor of attending one of our military academies and serving a very grateful nation.	689369761167499
573002239470919	While I had hoped that the unprecedented Operation Choke Point would have been far behind us by now, it was once again necessary to offer an amendment to the annual Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations legislation to prohibit funding for it. \n\nIn the 113th Congress, I offered an amendment which passed the House with unanimous support to block funds for Operation Choke Point and I am pleased that an identical amendment for Fiscal Year 2016 passed unanimously. My colleagues and I will continue to ensure DOJ and FDIC enforcement actions are focused on actual threats and risks and not politics and ideology as we continue to move forward with the fight to end this illegal program once and for all.	689118694525939
573002239470919	This morning I was proud to be in the room and watch, Elsie Shemin-Roth, formerly of Labadie, Missouri, receive the Medal of Honor on behalf of her father. Elsie and I were on a long and winding journey together and even after five years, we never gave up hope. Today was five years in the making and it was a true honor to watch Elsie stand next to the President of the United States and accept the highest honor for her father’s courageous and selfless acts of valor during World War I.	688529551251520
573002239470919	During my time in Congress, I have, and remain, strongly committed to our military and those who serve and have served our country.\n\nProviding for the common defense is one of the federal government’s constitutional responsibilities, and I take this responsibility very seriously. As such, Congress must ensure that our troops have the resources and state of the art equipment they need to complete their missions and return home safely.\n\nIn May, the House debated and ultimately passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA). The NDAA is the key legislation that provides the necessary authorities and funding for our nation’s military. It authorizes government defense programs, establishes funding levels for such activities, and sets policies under the manner in which federal funding may be spent.\n\nOne provision in the NDAA that is of particular importance to Missouri is funding for 12 additional F-18s, which can be converted to E/A-18G Growlers, which is the only electronic warfare airplane for the U.S. Navy. Additionally, it restores funding for the A-10 Warthog which is used by the U.S. Air Force to provide close air support for ground troops in combat situations. I have been a staunch supporter of maintaining money for these vital programs and have provided written testimony to the House Armed Services Committee indicating the importance of the F-18 line to our service members and the people of Missouri.\n\nWhile I am pleased that a bipartisan majority of House members passed the NDAA and sent it to the Senate, there are still many other pieces of common-sense legislation that would benefit our military personnel, their families, and our veterans that I would like to see enacted into law.  One of these bills that I am proud to cosponsor is the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act. This legislation would eliminate the so-called “widow’s tax” which forces surviving spouses of military members to forfeit some or all Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments if  benefits are also being received from the Department of Veterans Affairs Dependency and Indemnity Compensation program. The SBP program allows a career military retiree to pay a premium to fund a benefit for the retiree’s surviving spouse. The DIC is a separate program through the VA that provides benefits to surviving spouses of those whose deaths are determined to have been caused by military service.  Some Americans fall into both categories and the misguided offset policy penalizes them for it. Under current law, for every dollar a surviving spouse receives from the VA DIC program, a dollar from the Survivor Benefit Plan must be forfeited. For years, this has been an ongoing issue and it must be fixed. This legislation would rightfully give members of the military peace of mind that their loved ones would be taken care of, should anything happen.\n\nThere are many issues facing the 3rd District and our nation, but I will always remain attentive to the well-being of our fighting forces, our veterans, and the military families who have given so much to support their loved ones and our nation.	687926577978484
573002239470919	Today, the EPA announced its Waters of the U.S. rule which is an unprecedented power grab by this nation's administration. I have been a staunch opponent of this rule because it is an attack on individual rights and it is an encroachment on the rights of states to regulate the waters within their borders. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to block the EPA's poorly crafted rule.	685152924922516
573002239470919	Thank you to all the men and women who selflessly serve to protect our great nation. I hope everyone has a safe and blessed Memorial Day with friends and family.	684169981687477
573002239470919	There is no doubt that Memorial Day exists because the American spirit exists. \n\nWith that in mind, there is one story in mind that truly embodies the American spirit and persistence. Five years ago, I was approached by a constituent in my Washington, Mo. office wanting to tell her father’s story about his time defending our great nation in World War I. Her father, Sergeant William Shemin was in the 4th Infantry Division in the United States Army. And she believed that her father should be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in France in August, 1918. Sgt. Shemin selflessly exposed himself to enemy fire to rescue wounded troops and after all of his superior officers were either wounded or killed, he took command of his platoon and led it to safety, before he, himself, was wounded by a machine gun bullet. \n\nAs Sgt. Shemin’s daughter, Elsie, told the story of incredible bravery, I could visibly see how passionate she was about ensuring her father received, posthumously, the Medal of Honor. And while Sgt. Shemin was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, there was never any explanation why he didn’t receive the Medal of Honor – and I was determined to join her in this cause and see it through to the end. \n\nAs many of you know, the Medal of Honor is our country’s highest military honor and it is not awarded frequently. In fact, it requires an exhaustive review and approval process. Per the United States Army, Medals of Honor are “bestowed only to the bravest of the brave; and that courage must be well documented.” As a result of the irrefutable documentation that is required, it is even rarer for the Medal of Honor to be posthumously awarded for acts of valor that took place nearly 100 years ago, because the military is not able to review Medal of Honor cases dating that far back without approval from Congress. However, after working to secure passage of legislation to allow for the review of Sgt. Shemin’s case, and receiving favorable recommendations from the Army and Pentagon, I can now proudly state that the President of the United States will award Sgt. Shemin with the Medal of Honor on June 2nd, 2015, just shy of 97 years since that fateful day in France. While Sgt. Shemin was not able to receive this award during his lifetime, I take comfort in the knowledge that his daughter, Elsie, will be able to accept the Medal of Honor on his behalf and that we, as a country, can celebrate Sgt. Shemin’s lasting legacy. \n\nWhile stories like Sgt. Shemin’s are truly inspirational, we shouldn’t lose sight of the recognition that all of our country’s servicemembers and veterans deserve. There are men and women both out on the front lines and in supporting roles who we should give thanks to each and every day. It is because of them that we are able to enjoy the freedoms that we cherish so much. \n\nMemorial Day is a time to remember all of our veterans and servicemembers who stood fearlessly in defense of our nation. It is a day that serves as a reminder to remember what was lost and what was saved. I cannot wait to welcome Sgt. Shemin’s daughter to the nation’s capital and to see her finally hold her father’s Medal of Honor, which is truly a dream come true for her.	683066375131171
573002239470919	I am very pleased to announce the White House has officially stated the president will posthumously honor World War I veteran, Sergeant William Shemin, with the Medal of Honor on June 2, 2015. Sgt. Shemin's daughter, Elsie Shemin-Roth, will accept the highest award on his behalf.\n\nAfter five years in the making, this is truly one of the proudest and most humbling moments I’ve had as a Member of Congress. Five years ago, my constituent, Elsie Shemin-Roth, came into my Washington, Mo. office wanting to tell her father’s story and see if we would be able to help – and I told her I would do everything I can to ensure her father receives the Medal of Honor. Now, at last, it is truly amazing that we are able to rightfully celebrate her father’s lasting legacy. Working with Elsie for the last few years has been a great pleasure and I am more than excited for June so she can come to the nation’s capital and be given the highest award for her father’s courageous and selfless acts of valor during World War I.	680552838715858
573002239470919	I’m honored to cosponsor, along with the Missouri delegation, legislation that would rename Washington, D.C.’s iconic Union Station the “Harry S. Truman Union Station.” President Truman’s legacy has long surpassed him due to his career in Missouri and in the nation’s capital. Naming Union Station after President Truman would be a fitting tribute to a man who’s character and accomplishments are second to none.	680334922070983
573002239470919	Today I voted in support of H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\n\nThis week marks two years after Kermit Gosnell was found guilty for the senseless and horrific actions of delivering and then killing infants born alive. \n\nI have been a lifelong supporter of the unborn and I was proud to cosponsor and vote to ban abortions past 20 weeks. As a society, I believe it is our duty to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves and allow them the right to be born into the world. We must ensure there are no more so-called doctors, like Gosnell, in offices who have no respect for the right to life. I hope the Senate and the president act quickly to stand up for the unborn and make this important legislation the law of the land.\n\nH.R. 36 would ban abortions past 20 weeks, with an exception for instances of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at stake. Last Congress, the Congressional Budget Office estimated this bill, if enacted, would save 2,750 lives each year. In 2013, Gosnell was convicted of three counts of first degree murder in infant deaths. He agreed to serve a life term without parole and waived his right to appeal instead of facing the death penalty.	680005225437286
573002239470919	Yesterday, the House passed, with my support, H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act. I’ve been a staunch opponent of the EPA’s Waters of the United States (WOTUS) proposal so I was proud to co-sponsor and vote for legislation that passed the House today, which would stop this harmful rule from going forward.  \n\nThe bill passed by the House today would require the EPA to withdraw its WOTUS rule within 30 days and would require agencies to develop a new proposed rule to define the term “waters of the United States” with input from key stakeholders across the country. The poorly crafted WOTUS proposal from the EPA would be detrimental to our nation’s farmers, ranchers, and small business owners and I am pleased the House of Representatives brought this important legislation to the floor so we can reverse the EPA’s wrongdoings.\n\n It is my hope that my colleagues in the Senate will bring this legislation to the floor quickly, so that we can send it to the president’s desk as soon as possible.	679850558786086

573002239470919	Growing up as a young man working on my family’s farm and then going on to own my own small business, celebrating National Small Business Week is particularly special to me. \n\nWorking on my small family farm and learning the trials and tribulations of owning my own business taught me the importance of working hard – and that as a small business owner, you are often the first one to work each day and the last one paid. \n\nEach year I look forward to National Small Business Week because it serves as a way for us to focus on the importance of small business employers, their employees, and the products and services they offer. \n\nWhenever I travel through central and eastern Missouri and stop to talk with small businesses, I greatly enjoy hearing the triumphant stories of how businesses have blossomed. However, often those conversations are shadowed with the overbearing and counter-productive government regulation that keeps them from growing even more. \n\nThe House of Representatives is working hard to push against the administration’s regulations. Earlier this year, the House voted on the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvement Act. This bill would ensure that government agencies are completing the proper cost-benefit and economic analyses when proposing rules that affect not only small businesses, but businesses of all sizes. This bill also increases the transparency of the rule-making process by requiring agencies to provide a detailed summary outlining the disproportionate effects the proposed rule would have on small businesses.\n\nThis bill and other pieces of legislation the House has already passed, is intended to level the playing field for our nation’s small businesses. The endless regulations coming out of Washington are often given little to no thought from bureaucrats who probably have not worked in a small business before. And the implications these regulations have on our nation’s small businesses are very real. \n\nHowever, Americans are resilient and I know the entrepreneurial spirit is still out there. As vice chair of the House Small Business Committee, I have heard from small business folks around the nation that, while they are facing many hard times, the spirit is still alive and well. \n\nThe motivation and dedication of our small business friends, and the people that work for them, is at the heart of economic growth and prosperity. As a member of Congress, I take my role seriously to support policies that enhance opportunities for entrepreneurs by providing conditions that set-up folks for success.	678151272289348

573002239470919	It is that time of year when Congress begins to debate the annual appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year. And this year is the earliest the House of Representatives has started the appropriations process since 1974. Tackling these appropriations bills is vital to ensuring that Washington can appropriately rein in the overspending that is coming out of our nation’s capital.\n\nThe House is clearly ready to continue legislating and I wanted to highlight the first two appropriations bills that I supported this week.\n\nI proudly supported the Fiscal Year 2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill which ensures our nation’s veterans receive their much deserved health, job, and training for the future. We have all seen and heard the issues happening across Veterans Affairs clinics across America and this legislation directs the VA in the right direction. Included in this bill is additional funding to speed up VA claims processing; tracking progress toward reducing backlog by extending rigorous reporting requirements; and it tightens oversight of taxpayer dollars to address mismanagement. This legislation continues to create a seamless VA and Department of Defense electronic health record and, most importantly, it keeps the VA under the scrutiny of a magnifying glass. And for our men and women that serve in the military, this bill provides the support system and infrastructure to maintain the readiness for those overseas and care for their loved ones.\n\nIn addition, the House voted on the Fiscal Year 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. This protects funding for the critical national and regional waterways in America. Also included in this bill is language that prohibits implementation of the “Waters of the U.S.” rule, which I have been a staunch opponent due to the devastating effects it would have on our nation’s farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. And for the past few years, I have offered an amendment that would prohibit funding of the Missouri River Ecosystem Restoration Plan (MRERP). MRERP is a duplicative and unnecessary study that is funded on the backs of taxpayers. I was pleased my colleagues in the House, once again, recognized the importance of this amendment and unanimously support it in this year’s appropriations bill.\n\nLastly, I am very pleased to announce that for the first time in six years, the House and Senate came to an agreement on the budget. Not only did both chambers come to an agreement but this budget balances the budget in nine years; it repeals the president’s health-care law; it does not raise any taxes on Americans; and over the next ten years it adds 1.2 million jobs to our nation’s workforce.\n\nThis budget and these two appropriations bills set the vision for a stronger America. This week’s work focused on helping hard-working Americans get ahead by building a strong, more competitive economy and nation.	676012149169927
573002239470919	For the first time in six years, the House and the Senate were able to come together and agree to a budget that sets the guidelines for how much Washington will spend.\n\n Today, I supported a budget that, for the first time since 2001, balances in 10 years or less. Not only does this budget set America on a course to rein in spending, but it also prioritizes growing our economy, reforming our tax code, fully repealing the president’s health-care law; all without raising taxes on the American people. This budget focuses on helping hard-working Americans get ahead by building a strong, more competitive economy and nation.	675806055857203
573002239470919	We have now been in America’s new Congress for over 100 days. \n\nAnd over those 100 days, I am pleased to report the House of Representatives has kept its word to grow an “opportunity economy” instead of a Washington, D.C. economy. Things are different under House and Senate leadership and there is a lot of information to prove that.\n\nRecently, a report by the Bipartisan Policy Center found that, “The first three months of the 114th Congress showed a burst of energy, with Congressional committees reporting bills in higher numbers than during recent Congresses.”\n\nIn the 114th Congress, the House of Representatives has passed 62 bills which is more than double the 25 passed in the first 100 days in the last Congress and is twice as many as the 31 passed in the 112th Congress. And what is even more telling is, of those bills, eight have been signed into law by the president. \n\nThe 62 bills that have been passed out of the House are priorities of Americans for a more prosperous America. For example, an overwhelming percent of Americans want to see implementation of the Keystone XL Pipeline so the first bill the House passed was to start construction – then, unfortunately, the president vetoed it. \n\nThe House has also listened to the voices on Main Street and one important piece of legislation that passed was the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. This legislation was a compilation of 11 previously House-passed bills that would reduce the regulatory burdens facing emerging growth companies and small business investors. Among one of the 11 bills included was my legislation, the SBIC Advisers Relief Act, which would reduce duplicative registration and regulation on advisers to small business investment companies. \n\nAnd to support our nation’s veterans, the House has passed several bills. One bill in particular was the Hire More Heroes Act, which would incentivize small businesses to hire veterans by exempting veterans who already receive health insurance through the Department of Veterans Affairs or reservists covered under TRICARE from being counted towards the number of employees required by the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act. \n\nIn addition, the House has voted to repeal the president’s health-care law, passed a budget for a stronger America, and has held the government accountable by unanimously supporting several pieces of legislation dealing with the IRS. \n\nFor information on all of the bills the House has passed over the last 100 days, please feel free to contact my office. Over the next 100 days, America’s Congress has no intention of slowing down and I will continue to keep my pledge to support legislation that empowers all Americans.	672892922815183

573002239470919	Spring has officially arrived and I know, like you, I am more than ready for longer days, warmer weather, and having friends and family over to grill hamburgers, pork steaks and corn on the cob. \n\nEverything I just listed seems like simple pleasures in life, however, when we are still under the Obama Administration we must not take anything for granted. Each day this administration issues more regulations on our nation’s small businesses and families but there is a new announcement out of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that truly takes the cake. \n\nRecently, the EPA announced a grant to the University of California-Riverside to conduct research directed at developing technology to reduce particle emissions from residential barbecues by decreasing the amount of grease that comes into contact with open flames. It is very likely that this is just the first step toward finding a way to regulate the every barbecue, grill, or smoker. \n\nThis is no joke; the EPA is spending your tax dollars to find ways to make it more expensive to grill in your own backyard. And sadly, we’ve seen similar actions from the EPA in the past. \n\nSomething else many Missourians use are wood burning stoves in homes. The EPA wanted to require New Source Performance Standards for residential wood burning heaters which would severely impact our 3rd District residents and small businesses. I filed legislation and I remained vocal about the overreach of the EPA until the agency finally scaled back on the rule and took several of my suggestions. Even more troubling is the fact that EPA highlighted in these regulations that they were not going after fireplaces and grills, yet.  \n\nInstead of having Americans worry about being able to have a family barbecue in the backyard, the administration needs to focus its efforts in getting people back to work and keeping more money in your pockets. I will continue to push back until the administration stops issuing excessive regulations on Americans, our economy, and small businesses.  \n\nI will continue to oppose this blatant waste of taxpayer dollars and I believe that any action by the EPA to restrict residential barbecues would increase the cost of grills and pits and would place burdensome and expensive rules on the businesses that manufacture these items and the consumers who use them.	670091806428628

183580061667324	Missourians do not need more federal regulation over their land.

Blaine Luetkemeyer to expose how bad this rule is and to highlight the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, which recently got passed out of committee.  This bill, which I am an original co-sponsor of, would require the EPA to withdraw the proposed rule and listen to input from the states, developers, and farmers that would be affected by it.  \n\nWe had great support from a lot of great groups, from the Missouri Pork Producers, to the Missouri Municipal League, and so many more!!

7954512692	Today I have been on the road back to #Ferguson to meet with Attorney General Eric Holder, along with other Missouri elected officials. Tonight, I will travel to Washington, and tomorrow I will meet with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, to talk about possible changes to the 1033 Excess Property Program. These are important issues, and I am approaching them with both determination and also careful consideration.	10152180173972693
7954512692	Yesterday we lost one of America’s most formidable authors, Dr. Maya Angelou, a witness to history and a celebrated champion for equality, peace, and justice. I will never forget the grace and benevolence Dr. Angelou extended to my son Evan at dinner on the Plaza in Kansas City a few years ago. My deepest sympathies are with her family during this difficult time. Her life, legacy, and words will continue to inspire us all.\n\nhttp://cleaver.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-cleavers-statement-on-the-passing-of-maya-angelou	10152027697337693
7954512692	On Veterans Day, which began at the end of the Great War, at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, we remember all those who served, all those who ensure our safety and sovereignty. And we thank you.	10151673269617693
7954512692	Too often, too many Americans are used to seeing dilapidated, abandoned homes in too many neighborhoods across the U.S. But thanks to thousands of tireless hours of hard work, the Builders Development Corporation and the City of Independence, MO have turned this house - one that was previously falling down - into a beautiful home, breathing new life into an entire neighborhood. I was privileged to help cut the ribbon to mark the official completion of the rehabilitation of this beautiful house in Independence, MO.	10152011996582693
7954512692	Very saddened to hear of the damage to homes, businesses, and the entire community in Orrick. At the same time, very grateful that no deaths and no injuries have been reported. With the support of our friends and neighbors, I know this part of Missouri’s Fifth District will recover and rebuild.	10151997840132693
7954512692	It’s been a century since the start of WWI and to this day, we have no national memorial to honor this period in our history.  It’s time to pay tribute to the great sacrifices made by 4.7 million veterans, 116,000 of whom made the ultimate sacrifice. Today, I introduced a bill to redesignate the Liberty Memorial at America's National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, as the “National World War I Museum and Memorial.”	10151973587212693
7954512692	Yesterday, members of the clergy, faith leaders, and residents from throughout our community, gathered with one mind and one heart. We shall forever honor the memory of 14 year old Reat Underwood, his grandfather Dr. William Corporon, and Teresa LaManno. Why were they suddenly and violently taken from their families and friends? How can we remain hopeful for spring when the coldness of winter persists? This is a problem that all people struggle with—people of faith and of reason. One message resonates loud and clear: those who hate are, indeed, present in this world, but those who love outnumber them exponentially. Their ‘goodness’ shines so brightly, that there is an undeniable power of love, of strength, and of support that will not be denied.	10151954118042693
7954512692	My heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to all of the families and friends of those shot and killed yesterday in the senseless, horrendous, and hate-filled targeting of children and seniors, simply because of their faith. My hope is that all of those touched by this unspeakable tragedy, will feel the arms of our entire community -- reaching out and pulling them close. That they will feel the love of our embrace, and be comforted by the knowledge that together, we renew our rejection of bigotry and rededicate ourselves to the fight for freedom -- and for faith.	10151947014447693
7954512692	More than 250,000 people in our community proudly proclaim their Irish heritage. Today, we remember the hard-working Irish immigrants who helped build Kansas City, we celebrate the Irish heritage that so many appreciate, and we honor Saint Patrick himself. Slainte!	10151902043067693
7954512692	Tonight at 6:30 p.m., I will join Governor Nixon, Missouri State Rep. Noel Torpey, and my son, the Rev. Emanuel Cleaver, III, at St. James United Methodist Church. We will talk about how strengthening Medicaid will provide affordable health care to 300,000 working Missourians and bring our tax dollars back to Missouri. Will I see you there?	10151901970307693
7954512692	Last week, in a hearing on financial regulation and U.S. competitiveness, I was reminded of a time way back when I played football. I was a linebacker, and we lived for moments where we could really put it to a running back or a wide receiver and hear the crowd roar. It made my team very competitive. The game used to be brutal until changes in the rules made it a little less exciting, but a lot safer and more sensible. Just as game play on the field has changed because of reasonable rules, so too has our financial system. We changed the rules after the global financial crisis—making our financial system, and our economy, safer for consumers, business owners, homeowners, and investors.	10151892572512693
7954512692	Yesterday, the President signed an Executive Order raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10.10 an hour. I applaud the President for assisting hundreds of thousands of Americans, including many thousands in Missouri’s Fifth District, get a fair wage for their hard work. It has been far too long since Congress took action to increase the minimum wage. Full-time workers should not be falling below the poverty line in this country, and struggling just to put food on the table for their family. This is an important step forward.	10151848590502693
7954512692	Today, we witnessed a historic moment as the first female Chair of the Federal Reserve joined the House Financial Services Committee to discuss the current state of our economy and the conduct of the Federal Reserve. According to the latest reports, our economy still continues to grow, slowly but surely. Still, both our Congress and the Federal Reserve can and must do more to ensure we achieve full employment and continued economic prosperity.	10151845929897693
7954512692	I applaud the President’s message of opportunity, optimism, and action. This country was founded on the notion that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should have the opportunity to succeed. It’s past time to make that happen. It's absurd for Congress to dig into political positions and refuse to work in a bipartisan manner. It’s time to stop digging – and start building. #SOTU	10151822409562693
7954512692	It was 50 years ago today that President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty in this country. We have come so very far, to be sure, but this battle is no where close to being over. We have within our power the ability to stamp out poverty in this country - in this generation. It is a matter of priorities. It is ironic that the 50th Anniversary of the War on Poverty comes as we fight to restore emergency unemployment insurance for the more than 1.3 million Americans still searching for work. This is a lifeline so critical that allows people to look for work while still being able to feed their families. We must pledge anew our commitment to create jobs, raise the minimum wage, and end poverty in this great nation.	10151784560422693
7954512692	As you may have heard, I had surgery earlier today for an old knee injury. Thank you all for your good wishes, thoughts, and prayers as I recuperate. I hope to be back in action soon.	10151782724987693
7954512692	As we move together into 2014, one of my greatest hopes is that civility to and with one another will become the norm, instead of the exception. Truly taking time to get to know a person, an opinion, or a way of life, is certainly more difficult in the short term, but absolutely more hopeful for the future. I look forward to plunging into 2014 – together – with high hopes, hard work, and a renewed commitment to civility. Happy New Year to you.	10151769735317693
7954512692	There has never been, nor will there ever be, another Nelson Mandela. I cannot put into words the deep respect and profound admiration I have for him. He was a fighter -- for freedom, for forgiveness, and for peace. Nelson Mandela sacrificed so much for equality, democracy, and for what is right. He transformed South Africa -- and indeed, the world.	10151722525077693

7954512692	Today, on Tuesday, October 1, 2013, the U.S. Congress failed to adequately fund the federal government, resulting in an imminent shutdown of federal agencies, needless harm to public servants and their families, and a resulting increase in costs to the taxpayer. Our communities, our economy, and our country as a whole will suffer the consequences. What a waste.	10151593534417693
7954512692	I am certainly open to debating our budget, our policy priorities, and how we should best serve our constituents. I am not, however, a believer in shutting down the entire government simply because my “side” cannot get what we want. The Fifth District is home to 44,371 government workers. They are not the only ones who will be impacted by a possible shutdown, but their sacrifices will be the most severe. This is no way to govern.	10151588979157693
544741092252764	Today I had the honor of welcoming veterans from our area to D.C. These WWII, Korean War, and Vietnam veterans made the trip to D.C. to visit their memorials. My office sent them off at 2 a.m., and I was honored to greet them this morning in D.C. It was especially moving to see kids visiting the memorial on vacation stop and thank the veterans for their service. We are so grateful for all they have sacrificed.	904090089651194

544741092252764	Our Founding Fathers eloquently wrote that the inalienable right to life isn’t granted by Congress or any legislature, but is endowed by our Creator. I am proud that last week The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which I cosponsored, passed the House of Representatives as one of the most significant pieces of pro-life legislation to ever come before the House.

544741092252764	Owner Sam Conlon showed me her design studio in the historic Ste Genevieve Water Dept where she creates art and decor from recycled tin. She sells it at her shop, Rust, located in another historic building. Conlon fell in love with Ste Gen when driving through the city 15 years ago and opened her first business, Only Child Originals. It was a fun stop during National Small Business  Week!	883397845053752

544741092252764	Camp Hope in rural Farmington celebrates its 8th anniversary this year and it is what’s #greatinthe8th this week! Started by Will and Gailia White in memory of their son Chris Neal White who was killed in Iraq, it's a place where wounded veterans come to heal. They take part in outdoor activities like hunting and fishing. I salute their commitment to remember the fallen by caring for wounded warriors.	874538152606388
544741092252764	Congratulations to the Rolla Area Sheltered Workshop on its 45th anniversary! It is a place that empowers individuals to use their skills working in a sheltered environment with caring staff. Since its establishment in 1970, the workshop has provided quality employment for individuals with disabilities of all kinds.\n\nBeginning in January 1969, the mother of a disabled son saw a need for a work environment for those who were too old for a State Training School. Together, the mother and two women who were involved with the Jaycettes, developed the idea for a nurturing location in Rolla. With the help and support of the entire community, the Rolla Area Sheltered Workshop opened its doors a little over a year later. Today, the workshop has 75 disabled employees who have found an environment where they can work productively and independently.	868678609859009
544741092252764	Look at these great students! Wayne County Clerk Brenda Barfield Seal swore in poll workers last week at Clearwater High School in Piedmont.

544741092252764	I was at the funeral for my friend State Auditor Tom Schweich today, so I was not in Washington for the DHS funding vote. If I had been there, I would have voted NO on the clean DHS funding bill that did not block the president’s executive amnesty. My conservative colleagues and I will continue fighting President Obama’s unconstitutional overreach, an action the president himself said 22 times was outside his authority.	848558785204325

185361254941832	I had the opportunity to meet Jaydyn Child this morning and present her with the Montanan of the Week award. Jaydyn is a Girl Scout who just received the Gold Award for her important community work. Great to meet you Jaydyn!	701094406701845
185361254941832	Trivia fact for the day: 70% of female U.S. Senators and nearly 60% of female U.S. Representatives in Washington were Girl Scouts. So thrilled to be in Bozeman celebrating the opening of a new Girl Scouts office.	701088076702478
185361254941832	We must protect life. Today I helped introduce the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act -- an important measure to do exactly that: protect unborn children who can feel pain.\n\nI believe it is critical to help the most vulnerable in our society and the unborn are certainly among those most in need and deserving of our advocacy. Studies have shown that babies can feel pain by 20 weeks – and as I have to believe any American would agree, it is unconscionable to subject a child, at any stage in their life, to such pain. Thanks U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham and Susan B. Anthony List for your support on this issue and helping get this important bill introduced.	700601063417846
185361254941832	Today, I led a bipartisan coalition of more than a dozen Senators to ensure the federal government prioritizes high-speed broadband access for rural Americans. \n\nI pressed Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Co-Chairs of the Broadband Opportunity Council, for a detailed analysis of the various federal broadband initiatives that can be coordinated across agencies to bridge the digital divide and bring rural America into the 21st century. Our rural communities deserve the same access to broadband as their urban counterparts.	699488273529125

185361254941832	Another day, another federal one-size-fits-none policy forced on Montanans courtesy of the Obama administration. This afternoon, the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service released their plans to manage the greater sage-grouse habitat. \n\nI have serious concerns that the Obama admin’s land-use plans will have a detrimental impact on Montana’s economy, our land users and Montanans’ way of life. The Obama administration should implement Montana’s plan, which best addresses our state’s unique needs and can protect the greater sage-grouse. Montanans know best how to manage our state's resources, land and wildlife, not Washington, D.C. bureaucrats.	693961724081780
185361254941832	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) just released a new "Waters of the United States" rule that is a direct threat to Montana’s agriculture and natural resources industries, jobs and water rights.\n\nMontanans who live and work on the land every day know how to best manage our state’s resources – not federal bureaucrats in Washington who want to regulate every pond, puddle, and ditch in our state. I’ll continue working to stop the EPA’s overreach and protect Montana jobs and Montana agriculture and natural resources.	693538280790791
185361254941832	This Memorial Day, I join all Montanans in coming together to remember those who gave their lives in service to our country and honor the tremendous sacrifice, bravery and courage of all men and women in uniform, past and present. Please join me in keeping our soldiers in your thoughts and prayers as they're serving our nation far away from home and in harm's way. Today, we are especially grateful for their selfless service.	691152651029354
185361254941832	Happy Mother's Day! Thankful for my mom, Sharon, and my wife, Cindy.	683265455151407

185361254941832	Today is our National Day of Prayer, a day when Americans of all faiths gather together to pause and turn their attention toward God.  Please join me today join me in praying to ask God for wisdom, protection and strength for our nation.   May God continue to bless Montana and our nation.	681965285281424
185361254941832	Montanans have seen firsthand the dangers of big government’s intrusion into our daily lives, our personal information and our privacy. That’s why yesterday, I introduced legislation to end the bulk collection of Americans’ phone records. It’s critical that comprehensive reforms are put in place to end the mass collection of Montanans’ personal data and protect Montanans’ civil liberties from the egregious abuses of power we’ve witnessed at the hands of the federal government.	678642638947022
120660834778561	In honor of Women’s History Month, join me in recognizing the extraordinary contributions women have made throughout history, women like Eva Adams, appointed by President Kennedy to be the Director of the US Mint in 1961, reappointed by President Johnson in 1966, and served until 1969.	135211059990205
185361254941832	I had a great time spending Take Your Child to Work Day with my oldest daughter, Annie. She attended a Commerce Committee hearing with me, Skyped with students from Lincoln High School and accompanied me to votes in the Senate. It’s always nice to be able to share your work with your children.	675571272587492
185361254941832	Today, I voted against Loretta Lynch for Attorney General. I remain convinced that she will not be an independent voice and nonpartisan leader that will uphold the laws of our land and consistently defend our Constitution.	675531765924776
185361254941832	On tax day, we are once again reminded that our nation's tax code places an undue burden and unnecessary hardship on hardworking Montana families, small businesses, farmers and ranchers. The death tax is a direct threat to our state’s ag economy and the future of Montana family farms — many of which have been passed down from generation to generation. It’s time to repeal the death tax and work toward a fairer and simpler tax code that encourages growth and prosperity for all Montanans.	671008529710433
185361254941832	Today our state lost a true servant, Governor Tim Babcock. I first met Governor Babcock when I was the youngest delegate for Ronald Reagan at the 1984 Republican Convention. Governor Babcock always took time to encourage young leaders and served as a tremendous mentor not only for myself, but countless others. The Governor has always been a tireless servant who dedicated his life to Montana and this country. Cindy and I will be keeping his family in our prayers during this time.	666659893478630
185361254941832	Montanans know firsthand the immeasurable damage that human trafficking has inflicted on our communities, our schools, and most of all, the victims of these horrific crimes. We also know the importance of coming together to support the victims of this modern-day slavery. \n\nThat’s why I can’t understand why some Senate Democrats are obstructing the bipartisan, broadly supported Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. It’s unconscionable that anyone would rather place political games above abolishing human trafficking and securing long-overdue justice for thousands of victims. It’s time for Democrats to put politics aside and do what’s right for the victims of human trafficking.	655890317888921
185361254941832	Today is National Agriculture Day, a day to highlight Montana’s number one industry and the more than 27,000 farms and ranches across our great state. Ag contributes more than $2 billion to our economy and supports thousands of jobs across our state. Please join me in saying thank you to the many farmers, ranchers and producers who work everyday to make our state a better place.	655319871279299
185361254941832	One of my greatest honors is to recognize Montana’s true heroes. Today, I joined Senator Jon Tester in introducing legislation to rename the Armed Forces Reserve Center in Great Falls the “Captain John E. Moran and Captain William Wylie Galt Armed Forces Reserve Center”. This facility will serve as a reminder of their selfless service and sacrifice on our behalf.	649636328514320
185361254941832	Today the FCC voted on the Obama administration’s 317-page regulation that is nothing short of a government takeover of the Internet and a power grab that will slap more red tape on Americans’ Internet access. Rather than working toward bipartisan solutions that create jobs and promote innovation, the President and his administration have forced through yet another short-sighted regulation that will likely increase costs for the thousands of Montanans who rely on the Internet for economic opportunity and access to critical communication services.  I will continue working to maintain a free and open Internet and stop the Obama administration's reckless Internet takeover.	640451852766101
185361254941832	Loretta Lynch has an accomplished career as the United States Attorney in the Eastern District of New York and has built a strong and admirable resume. Her capability as a litigator is clear.  A strong resume is a necessary but not sufficient qualification for confirmation.\n \nAfter carefully considering Ms. Lynch’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am not confident, nor do I believe, that she will be an independent voice or nonpartisan leader that will defend the rule of law.  I have serious doubts and concerns regarding Ms. Lynch’s ability to maintain the balance of power set out by our constitution and will instead be malleable when the President seeks to extend and overstep his powers. Due to her statements to the Committee, I do not have faith that Ms. Lynch will uphold the laws of our land and consistently defend our constitution as our Attorney General.	640349012776385
185361254941832	Senate Democrats continue to defend Obama’s illegal action on immigration and block funding for the Department of Homeland Security. A federal court has already ruled that President Obama’s executive order is illegal. It’s time that Democrats end their obstruction and allow the Senate to consider this legislation. Tonight, Senate Democrats stood with President Obama— not the American people.	638969892914297

48426842354	The State of the Union is a great American tradition. The presidential address demonstrates the American ideal of openness and transparency in government even in the midst of deep philosophical division.\n\nOverall, the President’s speech tonight was sincere with a number of inspirational moments. He had a strong emphasis on helping one another and on supporting the ‘family’ of our nation—especially his gratitude for our troops—which was appropriate and moving. Unfortunately, his analysis of our economic recovery excluded exorbitant healthcare costs that are hurting so many families, as well as the regulations that are harming small businesses, limiting the promise of ownership and opportunity for all. Small business is the key to a healthy economy—not more concentration of power in Washington. I did, however, respect the President’s emphasis on a new politics that lifts up young people and gives them a sense of purpose.\n\nWe must restore an opportunity economy through responsible government, reclaim our best traditions, and rebuild a culture that respects the life and dignity of all persons. In the months ahead we must repurpose Washington—and turn our country around.	10155699055202355

5962789983	Thank you to everyone who reached out to oppose the misguided proposal by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to ban M855, common ammunition among sportsmen.  The ATF has delayed further action on the proposed ban.  We must continue to monitor their actions to ensure our Second Amendment rights are protected.	10150502727234984
5962789983	Earlier this week, I voted against Obama’s executive amnesty when the House considered the Department of Homeland Security Appropriation bill.  I will continue to fight the overreach of the Obama Administration.	10150500201229984
5962789983	A federal judge issued a court order blocking Obama’s executive amnesty. This is a clear step in the right direction. We now need the Senate to act on the House-passed Department of Homeland Security bill to put an end to Obama’s immigration overreach.	10150494945839984

307227745970624	With the White House closing its doors to the public in order to save money for the sequester, it's worth remembering some of the other costs the White House incurs annually.\n\nLike the "Chief Calligrapher" who has an annual salary of $96,725, and her two deputies who get paid $85,953 and $94,372.	617596434933752
307227745970624	Cut Waste: Just before sequester, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) spent $50 million for new uniforms or $1,000 per employee. The TSA uniform allowance nearly doubles to $446 per year. By comparison, a Marine lieutenant receives a one-time uniform allowance of $400.	617097161650346
307227745970624	Cut Waste: The White House had 18 months to establish rational priorities among accounts and did nothing. House passed two sequester replacements in that time. A government that borrows 35 cents of every dollar it spends can't reduce that borrowing by 2 cents?	614325995260796

155211751194624	MYTH - Trade deals with other countries harm the US economy\n \nFACT -- 95% of the world's consumers live outside the United States. So if American workers and businesses are to remain competitive we must find new markets to sell American made goods and services. Trade accomplishes that. And trade supports AMERICAN jobs. A recent study showed trade with other countries supports more than 350,000 Nevada jobs - that's one in five jobs supported by trade. In 2013 alone Nevada companies sold 17.5 billion dollars in goods and services to 190 countries around the world. Chances are you know someone whose job depends on trade. There is a direct connection between trade and a healthy Nevada -- and national -- economy.	885304354852023
155211751194624	MYTH - Trade Promotion Authority gives the Executive Branch unilateral power on trade \n \nFACT - If you don't want to cede more power to the Executive Branch or if you don't trust the current President to negotiate a fair trade deal for American workers, than you should support TPA. Right now, the President is negotiating TPP absent any Congressionally-mandated process. Passing TPA will bring the trade deal negotiating process out into the open, allowing Congress to define U.S. negotiating objectives BEFORE the deals are negotiated, and still requires congressional debate and an up-or-down House and Senate vote for final approval. TPA also requires that the text of a potential trade deal be posted online for 60 days and allows public comment during that time. Absent TPA, the President can continue to negotiate TPP and other trade deals with no input from the American people or their elected representatives.	885301464852312
155211751194624	Myth vs. Fact on Trade. \n\nMYTH - Congress is voting today on a secret trade deal \n \nFACT - Congress is not voting on any trade deal today. Not the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) or any other deal. What Congress IS voting on is Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), a bill that defines the process under which FUTURE trade deals will be negotiated.	885300501519075
155211751194624	Today I joined my colleagues in a press conference urging Congress to pass H.R. 535, the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act, which awards the Congressional Gold Medal to over 260,000 Filipino veterans of WW2. Filipino soldiers helped ensure Allied victory in the Pacific. Bestowing this honor upon them is past due, but I am pleased to join in this bipartisan, bicameral effort to award these friends of the United States the Congressional Gold Medal. We must also acknowledge all of those who have not had their service formally recognized by the United States. While this Gold Medal is an important and necessary step, I will continue the fight to have the Denied Filipino Veterans recognized.	884928118222980

422460677824474	Yesterday, I asked White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, "Does this bill put taxpayers on the hook?" and he said "No."\n\nThe White House Statement of Administration Policy stated that the bill would "weaken a critical component of financial system reform aimed at reducing taxpayer risk." The bill was too rushed for a full, deep analysis of the risk before this critical vote.	744484328955439
422460677824474	I strongly oppose today's "CROmnibus" bill, which would hurt working Americans by allowing big-money bailouts for banks and rolling back already-inadequate campaign finance laws.	743990639004808

422460677824474	Today, I voted against a bill to fast-track the Keystone Pipeline project, a political ploy that would result in a huge giveaway to TransCanada. \n\nIn order to create jobs and boost the economy, Congress should stop delaying comprehensive legislation to address our nation’s infrastructure and clean energy needs. This country needs roads and bridges, and men and women need jobs—now.\nhttp://shea-porter.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/shea-porter-statement-on-hr-5682-legislation-to-fast-track-keystone	730200100383862

422460677824474	Thirteen years ago today, our world changed forever when terrorists hit America.  We lost thousands of good people that day, killed by those who tried, but failed, to destroy America’s great spirit and determination.  I pray for those citizens and first responders who perished or were injured, and for their families.  Their courage and heroism continue to inspire us all.  Our responsibility in Congress remains the same—to protect the greatest country on Earth, the United States of America.	695991210471418

422460677824474	In New Hampshire and across the country, investment in infrastructure serves a critical role in local economies by helping expand economic growth and supporting well-paying construction jobs.

422460677824474	The Supreme Court's decision today is incredibly disappointing. The debate over birth control was seemingly settled decades ago, and most companies and institutions had been offering birth control coverage as part of a health care package without controversy. This decision will only make some women's lives even more difficult, and leaves me wondering what's next from this activist Supreme Court.	660921953978344

115543081952049	Excited to attend the Hillsborough County Drug Court Service Day BBQ yesterday in Nashua.

Congratulations to all the brave participants who take part.	434379313401756
115543081952049	I was honored to speak at the New Hampshire Veterans Home in Tilton in honor of Memorial Day. On Monday, we gathered to honor the courageous men and women who have lost their lives while serving in our nation’s Armed Forces. These Americans gave their lives to protect our freedom and way of life, and we must forever remember their sacrifices.	433647500141604
115543081952049	On this Memorial Day, we honor those who made incredible sacrifices to serve and protect this nation. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know firsthand the debt we owe our brave soldiers, who fought to uphold the ideals we all hold dear. Now, it is our time to repay that debt, and continue to fight to ensure our veterans have access to the services and benefits they deserve. I ask you to join with me in honoring these brave men and women today and every day.	432328346940186
115543081952049	Since I first took office, I have been working to improve services and support for victims of military sexual trauma. I was proud to help pass the Ruth Moore Act in yesterday's VA Committee meeting. This bill takes an important step forward in the fight to expand access to care for victims of military sexual assault by making it easier for them to receive the medical services they need. The men and women who have served our nation and suffered these crimes must have access to treatment and other services, and this common sense, bipartisan bill will help ensure that they do.	430498537123167
115543081952049	I applaud my colleagues in the House for coming together to pass a bill I helped introduce, the BRAVE Act. By allowing the VA Secretary to give preference to contractors who employ veterans when awarding contracts, this bill will help encourage the hiring of veterans all across our nation. We owe our veterans a great debt of gratitude for their service, and we must promote programs to increase veteran employment and ease the transition back to civilian life for veterans when they return home.	429454457227575
115543081952049	I was honored to be a part of Plymouth State University’s commencement ceremony on Saturday!

115543081952049	Last night I joined the New Hampshire Police Association in Washington to honor the memory of Brentwood police officer Stephen Arkell. He dedicated his life to serving our community, and his courage and commitment were apparent to everyone who knew him. On Peace Officers Memorial Day, we commemorate Officer Arkell and remember the incredible work our first responders do every day to keep American families safe.	427954477377573
115543081952049	This week, a new memo surfaced written by one of the VA’s top senior procurement officials which revealed extremely wasteful spending at the VA, particularly involving the use of purchase cards – meant for small purchases only – to obtain billions of dollars’ worth of medical equipment. Appalled by this news, I questioned VA officials yesterday during a VA Subcommittee Hearing on Oversight and Investigations. At a time when every cent should be going towards improving health outcomes for our veterans, the VA does not have money to waste – and I firmly believe we must put an end to this egregious practice once and for all.	427841654055522
115543081952049	Today, I join New Hampshire’s law enforcement community in remembering Officer Stephen Arkell. Officer Arkell served his community of Brentwood and the state of New Hampshire with honor and courage, and he was tragically killed in the line of duty a year ago today. My thoughts and prayers are with Officer Arkell’s family and friends as we honor his legacy of service and bravery. During National Police Week,  let us keep in mind the great sacrifices that police officers make to protect our families and communities in the Granite State and across the country.	426892064150481
115543081952049	Today is the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Europe by the Allied Forces, which marked the end of World War II in Europe and which we now celebrate as V-E, or Victory in Europe Day. My father, Malcolm McLane, flew 73 missions in a P-47 Thunderbolt throughout the European Theater, including during the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, and was shot down in the Battle of the Bulge. He was captured and held in a German prison camp until being released on V-E Day, May 8th, 1945. So today, we honor my dad and all of the other men who courageously fought and sacrificed during World War II.	425580314281656

115543081952049	In honor of Small Business Week, I visited Whitney Brothers Co. in Keene today – a successful family-owned manufacturer of children’s furniture.  Our manufacturing sector is vitally important to New Hampshire’s economy, which is why one of my top priorities in Congress has been to support small businesses and manufacturers in the Granite State!	425282807644740
6756553401	The president’s budget proposal would increase the national debt by nearly $9 trillion and will never balance.  I don’t see how throwing more money at our spending problem will help our country.  Would you support a budget plan that balances in the next ten years?	10152882046593402
115543081952049	Yesterday I announced the reintroduction of my Carbon Monoxide Prevention bill at the Hudson Fire Department, which I introduced after hearing from local New Hampshire fire officials about the importance of the programs this bill will create. I was joined by New Hampshire Fire Marshal Degnan and fire officials from Hudson and Nashua to announce this critical bill and discuss the importance of carbon monoxide education and prevention. We must keep working to keep Granite State families safe from the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.	425276690978685
115543081952049	I was proud to welcome Jane Chu, Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, to Concord yesterday for a tour of the Capitol Center for the Arts.

115543081952049	During my visit to the VA Medical Center in White River Junction this week, I toured the facilities and heard about their efforts to provide quality health care to our brave veterans.

Our veterans served us, and now it is our turn to serve them.	425005657672455
115543081952049	Today, the Supreme Court began hearing arguments on four cases that will help determine whether same-sex couples will be treated fairly in the eyes of the law. Our country was founded on principles of equality and justice for all, and it’s long past time to ensure that no American is discriminated against because of who they love. I urge the Supreme Court to rule on the side of justice and equality for all so that every American, regardless of their sexual orientation, has the legal right to marry the person they love. #LoveCantWait #MarriageEquality	422526477920373

177208315676754	Yesterday afternoon, I voted in favor of the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 420-5. The bill allows veterans who have experienced long wait times to seek care outside the VA, provides for more physicians to work in the system, and also allows the VA Secretary to remove officials involved in any mismanagement. This is a big step towards securing the care that our brave veterans deserve.	765603356837244
177208315676754	Today the thoughts and prayers of our entire office staff are with the Webster family of Medford, as they mourn the loss of Mr. William Webster.

177208315676754	This morning the House passed, with my support, H.R. 3811, the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act of 2014. The concern over the security of personal data collected through the ACA’s insurance exchanges is a serious matter, and yet another example that proves Obamacare is not ready for primetime. Americans have the right to know if and when their personal information is exposed.	655003014563946
177208315676754	After a great deal of thought and discussions with my family, I have decided not to seek re-election in 2014. Politics shouldn't be a career and I never intended to make it one. While it has truly been an honor to serve the people of New Jersey’s 3rd Congressional District, at this stage in my life, and more importantly, the lives of my three children, spending time with them is my top priority. As I serve out the rest of my term, I will continue to work hard on behalf of the people of South Jersey.	621064934624421
177208315676754	Secretary Sebelius’s testimony today before the House Energy and Commerce Committee was a reminder that Obamacare is not ready for primetime. Because of this, and the negative impacts that Obamacare will have on small businesses and families in South Jersey, I have consistently voted to repeal the law.	617041715026743
177208315676754	Last week Congress passed legislation intended to make sure that our military continued to get paid during the government shutdown.  The Secretary of Defense was given broad discretion on how this law could be interpreted for providing resources to our servicemembers and their families. Unfortunately, the DoD failed to utilize this authority and as a result, survivors of U.S. military personnel recently killed in action in support of Operation Enduring Freedom did not receive the “death gratuity” owed to them.  As a result, the House passed another measure earlier today to clarify the authority granted to the DoD for benefits owed to survivors that the Senate is also expected to pass, and the President is expected to sign.\n\nMy heartfelt sympathies go out to each of the affected families. This failure of leadership is something that they should never have experienced after having lost their loved ones.  I am pleased that moving forward these families will be granted the benefits they are owed.	605632302834351
177208315676754	Tonight please continue to keep the victims, their families, and the brave first responders in your thoughts and prayers after this tragic event today at the Washington Navy Yard.	594022970661951
177208315676754	Please keep the residents and businesses of Seaside and our brave first responders in your thoughts and prayers as they battle this devastating fire along the boardwalk. The Jersey Shore faced terrible destruction less than a year ago and came back even stronger. This time will be no different and I will fight to ensure we remain Jersey Strong.	592139847516930
177208315676754	Looking forward to President Obama's address to the nation this evening. Below is a letter that I sent to my constituents earlier today regarding my position on U.S. intervention in Syria.     \n\n    \n    By now we have all seen the video footage of Syrian men, women and children being brutally murdered seemingly at the hands of their government. No one can look at these images and not feel completely shocked and grief stricken. \n      \n    This week Congress begins debate on a resolution authorizing U.S. military force as a way to deter the Syrian government from using chemical weapons against its citizens. Representatives must consider the images we’re seeing on the evening news, and the information gathered from numerous briefings. In addition there are many questions and concerns about the overall strategy and the wisdom of asking our brave men and women to take on another mission while the DoD budget continues to get slashed.\n      \n    As is typical of Washington, questions about how this impacts the President, the Congress, and how others view the U.S. have crept into the debate. And these are exactly the kinds of things that keep us from doing the job the American people expect of us.\n      \n    This is not about President Obama’s second term or whether he “wins” or “loses”.  It is not about Democrats and Republicans in Congress and how Washington will be viewed around the globe should the Congress fail to give the President what he wants. \n     \n     I can tell you that for me it is about the 60,000 men and women still serving in Afghanistan after more than a decade. It’s also about the fact that the one certainty of war is its uncertainty, and that no one can give a war weary American public a guarantee that U.S. involvement in Syria will end with a single narrowly targeted strike. In fact recent history clearly suggests that such a scenario is highly unlikely. The American people are smart enough to know that once the United States military strikes Syria, we own it - and there will be no easy way out.  \n      \n    Finally, as I’ve traveled throughout the district during August, I have seen and heard from many of you about this issue. Others have called, written or emailed expressing your opinions, which have been overwhelmingly opposed to military action. For all of these reasons, if I had to cast my vote right now – I would oppose U.S. military engagement in Syria.	591270934270488
177208315676754	I would like to take a moment and welcome home 1st Lt Matthew Cordell from his deployment in Afghanistan. Matthew, who was awarded the Bronze Star Medal during his deployment, is married to Naneva whose family lives in Medford. Naneva gave birth to the couple’s son just ten days before Matthew returned home to the U.S. Please join me in thanking Matthew for his dedicated service to our nation, and welcoming him back home to New Jersey’s Third Congressional District.	578485302215718
177208315676754	Today, FEMA announced a $1.18M grant to Seaside Park to assist in the town’s recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. As another beach season winds down, this money is critical to helping the town get back on its feet and ready for 2014.	576635612400687

177208315676754	For those of you who need to know about who the increased student loan rate impacts here is the background.  On July 1, 2013 the interest rate on all Stafford subsidized loans doubled on all NEW borrowers.  Anyone who took out any student loan prior to July 1 is not impacted.  To be clear this only impacts those applying for Stafford subsidized loans on or after July 1st, 2013.	563037520427163
177208315676754	On May 23, the House passed a bill to prevent student loan rates from doubling. Both the House and President Obama want to tie the rates to the 10-year treasury notes and don’t want Congress setting the rates in the future; they want the rates based on the markets. We agree on more than the Administration would lead you to believe. There are so many challenges we need to address, and it’s unfortunate that some in Washington want to create a crisis where none exists. #DontDoubleMyRate	562945277103054
6756553401	Today’s Trade Promotion Authority bill doesn’t do enough to ensure proper congressional oversight of future trade deals, strengthen middle class New Jersey families, or protect American jobs; and therefore I could not support it. Trade requires trust, and many New Jerseyans find it difficult to trust a White House that gave us unconstitutional amnesty, maintained the broken tax code, and implemented a massive government takeover of our health care system. While I believe there is a path to trade agreements that strengthen our country and protect American jobs, today’s bill falls short of the mark.	10153083431793402

6756553401	Here’s a shocking statistic: the national debt now represents roughly 101 percent of the entire gross domestic product of our country.  That means America owes more money to its creditors than the total value of all goods and services produced in the United States in an entire year. Do you think you can come up with better ways to spend your money than Washington?	10152882049283402

6756553401	Today we remember the loss of the heroic men and women who sacrificed their lives in defense of freedom and liberty.  We owe our way of life to their courage.  Their willingness to fight is the reason why we live in a country free from tyranny and oppression. \n\nIn honor of Memorial Day, I’m happy to announce that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee this week passed my bill to rename the United States Post Office building located at 1 Walter Hammond Place in Waldwick, NJ the “Staff Sergeant Joseph D’Augustine Post Office Building.”  This action clears the way for this important legislation to be passed by the House of Representatives and sent to President Obama for his signature.\n\nAs you may know, Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine, a 2001 Waldwick High School graduate, was killed in action in the Helmand province of Afghanistan on March 27, 2012.  He gave his life while protecting his fellow men and women in uniform.  Renaming the Waldwick Post Office after a hometown hero would be a fitting tribute to this brave young man.	10153014424713402

6756553401	As a previous commenter astutely noted, the total amount of time it takes to actually earn the money that you pay to the IRS—usually months—is far worse than the hours or days it takes to file.	10152940433668402
6756553401	It’s time to fix our broken tax code and replace the outdated rules with a pro-growth tax system, built upon the tenets of simplicity, fairness, and efficiency.	10152940421253402
6756553401	Getting rid of special interest loopholes will free-up American businesses to spend more time innovating, saving, and investing—and less time trying to get special tax preferences.	10152940420588402
6756553401	A simpler, fairer and flatter tax structure is the solution to this problem. LIKE and SHARE if you want more money in your pockets, less time spent filing taxes, and to see the end of special interest loopholes that unfairly create winners and losers in our country.	10152940420118402
6756553401	Did you notice that ObamaCare’s individual mandate—with a penalty for the uninsured— showed up on your tax filings this year for the first time?	10152940418718402
6756553401	As I mentioned yesterday, only 40 percent of people who call the IRS with questions about their tax filings are actually getting a live person on the phone.  However, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch found that the IRS spent $4.3 million on public opinion polling last year and almost $4 million for office furniture. Does this sound like an agency that cannot have its budget cut?	10152940417858402
6756553401	Considering the tax code is about 75,000 pages, it should come as no surprise that 90 percent of taxpayers use an accountant or commercial software to file their returns.  Are you one of them?	10152940416688402
6756553401	This year alone, American taxpayers and businesses will spend about 7.6 billion hours complying with the U.S. tax code. By the sound of it, the residents of New Jersey’s Fifth District are contributing to many of those hours.	10152940415343402
6756553401	It’s April 15th, Tax Day, and you’re probably giving a sigh of relief knowing that tax season is finally over.

6756553401	For over half a century, the Castro regime in Cuba has violently oppressed their people under a totalitarian regime, aided anti-American insurgencies, illegally shipped weapons, and continues to harbor murderers and terrorists.  Today’s announcement by the Obama Administration that they will remove Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list is misguided, dangerous, and offensive to the families who have been torn apart because of Cuba’s active participation in terrorist activities.  The Castro regime has refused to make a single concession or good faith effort to change the way they treat their people or denounce their history of terrorism.  There is no proof that Cuba is no longer a hostile threat to the interests and security of the United States.	10152938629418402

6756553401	This morning, the House Budget Committee passed a budget plan that takes bold steps to address the U.S.’ out of control spending. Our budget plan will: \n1) Balance in less than 10 years\n2) Cut $5.5 trillion in spending without raising taxes\n3) Repeal ObamaCare in full – including all of its taxes, regulations and mandates\nIt’s time for Washington to end the gimmicks and have an honest discussion about the dire state of our country’s finances with you—the American people.	10152884199863402
6756553401	One of the greatest burdens on our economy, on our budget, and on many American families is ObamaCare.  We need a full repeal–including all of its taxes, regulations and mandates.  Have you seen your family’s health insurance premiums go up since the law was enacted?	10152882050538402
6756553401	We cannot balance the budget on the backs of middle-class families by raising taxes at a time when many New Jerseyans are working hard to get ahead.  Have you made personal sacrifices in this economy?	10152882050108402
6517277731	I am deeply saddened by the news from Charleston. My thoughts and prayers are with the people and their city, and especially the families and friends of the victims of this senseless gun violence. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where the shooting took place, is a pillar of the community and the oldest  African Methodist Episcopal Church in the South, and will be a source strength as the community rebuilds.  I am glad that the Department of Justice is opening a hate crime investigation into this senseless tragedy. The shooter must be found and brought to justice.	10153116745357732

6517277731	Today, I toured the World Trade Center Health Program clinic at Rutgers, and called on Congress to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act. The bill would ensure first responders and survivors of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center continue to receive the monitoring and care they need\n\nOn 9/11, first responders answered our call for help when we needed them most.  Now, we owe it to them to reauthorize the Zadroga Act so they can continue to receive the care they need and deserve as they deal with the after-effects of their service at Ground Zero.\n\nFor more information, see my press release: http://pallone.house.gov/press-release/pallone-and-first-responders-call-congress-pass-911-health-legislation-advance-hearing	10153089264457732

100830109970339	Many of you have contacted my office concerning funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nAs you may know the U.S. House voted 257 to 167 to fund the Homeland Security Department through the end of the budget year.  I voted in favor of fully funding the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and against allowing DHS to undergo a shutdown.\n\nHours prior to my vote I had the distinct honor of watching personally Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu address the Congress and the American people.  Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed the threats from Iran, ISIS and a militant Islam not only to Israel but to the United States.  More than 180 Americans have tried or succeeded in joining extremists in Syria and Iraq, such as the three Brooklyn men recently arrested by the FBI.  And just last month, al Shabaab, al-Qaeda’s branch in Somalia, called on individuals in the West to carry out attacks against shopping centers like the Mall of America.  These threats are real.  \n\nListening to Prime Minister Netanyahu reinforced my view as to the importance of funding fully national security programs that keep America safe.  I have taken an oath to defend this country and its institutions against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  Shutting down the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — a federal agency charged with defending our national security — in this high-threat environment would be irresponsible and dangerous.\n\nI continue to oppose strongly President Obama’s illegal amnesty program.  We must pursue through the courts and through the Congress, as vigorously as possible, ways to stop these actions.  \n\nLike many of my colleagues I am encouraged by the recent federal district court injunction stopping the President’s unconstitutional executive overreach. I signed an amicus brief in that case in opposition to the President’s unconstitutional actions.  \n\nYet the U.S. Senate’s continued failure to block the President’s unilateral actions endangers our national security, hinders our efforts to secure the borders and puts the safety and security of the American people at risk.\n\nAt a time of growing terrorist threats both here at home and abroad we must fully fund our Nation’s homeland security operations and protect the American people.  \n\nBest personal wishes,\n\nLeonard	797339646986045
100830109970339	Many of you have asked me about today's immigration vote.\n\nWith my strong support, the U.S. House voted a few hours ago to block President Obama's unilateral actions to grant amnesty to millions who entered the country illegally.\n\nThe House bill (H.R. 240) would prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from using taxpayer funds or user fees to carry out the President's executive order announced last November.  \n\nThe House-passed measure also funds the largest number of Border Patrol agents in history, increases resources for the prevention of cyber-attacks, ensures a strong U.S. Coast Guard and fully funds the E-Verify program to help companies certify the work eligibility of their employees.  The bill now moves to the U.S. Senate for its consideration.\n\nRest assured as your Congressman I will continue to work with my colleagues in the House to strengthen the security of our borders and to implement an immigration policy that adheres to the rule of law and is enacted through the proper legislative process. -- L.L.	775557725830904
100830109970339	Many of my Facebook friends have contacted me regarding the recent election for Speaker of the U.S. House.  It is good to hear from all of you.\n\nThere’s an old adage: “To beat a horse you need a horse.”  While I certainly would have considered supporting a serious alternative in the race for U.S. Speaker of the House — like my friend Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, for example — no such candidate came forth.\n\nToday’s results showed this as no challenger to Mr. Boehner received more than 12 votes, and Congressman Louis Gohmert — the candidate that the media seemed to talk up the loudest — received but three votes.\n\nHouse Republicans selected Mr. Boehner as its GOP leader unanimously in a closed-door contest shortly after the election in November.  His nomination was unchallenged.  \n\nWith last minute candidacies that represented no real alternatives, today’s election was seen ultimately as a choice between Republican John Boehner and Democrat and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  I supported Speaker Boehner. \n\nI was joined by 215 of my Republican colleagues, including some of the most tried and tested conservative voices in Washington:  Jim Jordan of Ohio, Raul Labrador of Idaho, Trey Gowdy and Mark Sanford of South Carolina, Trent Franks and Matt Salmon of Arizona, Tom Price of Georgia, and Sam Johnson and Jeb Hensarling of Texas.\n\nNow is the time for House Republicans to work together with the new Senate Republican Majority to fight to cut spending, stop bad legislation, work to repeal Obamacare, and hold the President accountable for his actions.  I hope you will continue to support me in these efforts.\n\nBest personal wishes. -- L.L.	771956549524355

100830109970339	Lance Statement on the House-Passed Budget Conference Agreement\n \nWASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Leonard Lance (NJ-07) released the following statement regarding House-passage of the budget conference agreement:\n \n“Far from perfect, the Ryan-Murray budget compromise amounts to a modest agreement that averts another government shutdown, replaces the President’s sequester with smarter cuts, reduces the deficit by more than $20 billion and provides a level of certainty on spending that has not occurred in Washington for several years.  All without raising taxes.  \n \n"It is the first bipartisan budget deal brokered under divided government since 1986 and a small step forward in restoring some sanity and order to the budget process.  I applaud Chairman Ryan and Chairwoman Murray for their efforts, which I hope will lead to future agreements that improve our economy, tackle our long-term fiscal issues and create jobs so desperately needed."	592703897449622

This includes learning your views and opinions on the issue.\n\nFrom what I have learned and what I have heard, I do not support the use of force against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which would amount to U.S. intervention in a civil war.\n\nThe recent U.S.-Russia proposal to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014 deserves careful consideration by Congress.\n\nIt is my hope that this agreement will help advance an overall Syrian peace settlement that does not inject America into a civil war in the Middle East. -- L.L.	555606337826045

100830109970339	This week's Insta-Poll -- U.S. House to vote to expedite construction of Keystone oil pipeline\n\nThe House will vote this week on legislation that would expedite construction of the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline’s northern leg.\n \nThe Northern Route Approval Act, H.R. 3, would eliminate the need for pipeline builder TransCanada Corp. to get a cross-border permit from President Obama to complete the Canada-to-Texas project.\n \nRepublicans, centrist Democrats, business groups and some unions back the project saying the pipeline would create construction jobs and strengthen United States energy security.\n \nDemocrats and green groups, meanwhile, contend a sizable amount of the crude transported through Keystone is destined for export. They also have questioned supporters’ jobs claims, and say the pipeline would accelerate climate change by encouraging oil sands production.\n \nWhat do you think?\n \nDo you support or oppose the construction of the Keystone pipeline?	506423572744322
100830109970339	An update on today's meeting with President Obama:  It was a frank and candid exchange between parties in an effort to break Washington's gridlock.  \n\nThe President spoke for a large part of the meeting then took questions on topics ranging from the Nation’s fiscal impasse to immigration, guns, cybersecurity, Israel, the Keystone pipeline and the cancellation of White House tours due to sequestration.  \n\nAnd the President was the first to inform us that the College of Cardinals had chosen a new pope.\n\nAnd while we came to no agreements his visit with Republican lawmakers is certainly a step in the right direction and one that was long overdue.	482449478475065
100830109970339	I thought the President gave a very emotional and powerful speech last evening in Newtown where he rightfully pointed out that while no set of laws can eliminate evil in the world we as a Nation have an obligation to work together and remain focused on the issue at hand -- keeping firearms out of the hands of those in our society who wish to do harm.  \n \nWe need a thorough examination of our current gun laws and loopholes.  We also must begin a long-overdue discussion into the nexus between guns, mental health, and our current entertainment culture where Hollywood and video game makers tend to de-sensitization violence.  Some, like Sen. Joe Lieberman, have recommended a national commission on the issue similar to the one established following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  I support Sen. Lieberman's proposal.\n\nThe solutions are as complex as the problems themselves, so it is important that we work together in the weeks and months ahead in crafting a bipartisan response to these senseless acts of mass violence. -- L.L.	443292079057472

303312929155	Today's vote was an important victory for the American worker. For the first time in a long time this Congress stood up against a trade package and said enough. This Fast Track bill repeats the same old, failed process that led to disastrous free trade agreements of the past, rather than building on progress we had been making. Let’s take this opportunity to go back and make sure future trade deals are positive for American workers, for domestic producers, for human rights, and for our environment. Congress must put our trade policy on the right track, not the fast track.	10153684810394156
303312929155	Last evening, the House of Representatives passed my other amendment I offered to the 2016 Defense Appropriations Act that would restore $25 million from the Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Research Program. The defense appropriations bill cuts $25 million from the TBI program, representing a decrease of 20% from last year’s funding level. As it is, we are not living up to our responsibility in caring for the service members who have already been diagnosed with TBI. Now is not the time to cut this funding.	10153681998979156
303312929155	Today the House unanimously passed an amendment I offered along with the rest of the NJ delegation to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2016 in support of the successful #Vets4Warriors program. Thank you to Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen, Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, for speaking on the House floor in strong support of my amendment. The Vets4Warriors provides a safe place for veterans to seek help outside of the Defense Department, and I believe removing funding for this program is shortsighted.	10153680558404156

303312929155	Russia’s continued military aggression in #Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of more than 6,400 people since April 2014 and continues to threaten peace and security in the region. In advance of the upcoming #G7 Summit I urge President Obama and our allies in the European Union to increase the pressure against Moscow as Russia continues their pattern of aggression and flaunting of international norms. The fact is that despite multi-lateral sanctions that are having a dramatic effect on Russia’s economy, the Russians have only increased their support for rebels in Ukraine and intensified the bloodshed of Ukrainian citizens. In addition to maintaining the unity of sanctions, the time has come for the G7 countries to step up and provide Ukraine the military aid needed to defend themselves. I worry that a weak-kneed response to Russia from our allies will only strengthen Putin’s hand.	10153671054314156

I’ll continue to fight for this critical legislation in order to do right by these heroes and continue the progress we have made since the law’s initial passage.  It’s our obligation to care for the innocent victims that worked on our nation’s behalf for the days, weeks and months after we were attacked.	10153662575629156

Every child deserves a chance to succeed and a quality education sets them on that path. But we can’t expect them to compete when they don’t start school on a level playing-field. Head Start is our best hope for righting that wrong, which is why I will continue to fight for this important program.	10153615099864156

303312929155	On Workers Memorial Day, we remember all the American workers who lost their lives on the job and renew our call for workplace safety. Though we’ve seen improvements in recent years, the on-the-job death toll in this country is still too high. In 2013, 4,585 workers were killed on the job. We recognized this problem in 1970, when the death toll was three times that number, and responded by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Workplace injuries and deaths dropped significantly since. New Jersey saw 102 on-the-job fatalities in 2013. When it comes to workplace injuries and deaths, zero is the only acceptable number.	10153579480429156

191509977669708	Chairman Frelinghuysen's Opening Statement: Floor Debate on the FY16 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill:\n\nMr. Chairman, as I rise to present to the House the Appropriations Committee’s recommendation for the fiscal year 2016 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, there are nearly 200,000 servicemen and women serving abroad, doing the work of freedom on every continent – (in the Middle East, Europe, Africa and Asia). \n\nAnd, many more are here at home serving in every one of our states – Active, Guard and Reserves – all volunteers!  We are grateful to them and their families!\n\nThey are certainly not all experts in some of the language and terms that will be part of our vocabulary during this debate over the next 36 hours -phrases like “sequester” and “continuing resolution,” “BCA,” “Overseas Contingency Account,” and “Global War on Terrorism” GWOT account.”\n\nBut they have every expectation that they will have our united support for this bill whether they serve aboard a ship, fly through airspace or provide “over-watch” on land to support a mission.\n\nThis legislation was developed after 12 hearings, many briefings, travel to the Middle East and Europe and countless staff hours with those who serve us, military and civilians, very much in mind. \n\nThis is a product of a very bipartisan and cooperative effort, for which I thank my good friend, the Ranking Member Pete Visclosky.  We are both fortunate to have committee members who are engaged and committed so much to this product. And we are grateful for the support of Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey.\n\nIn total, the bill provides just over $578 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of $24.4 billion above the FY 2015 enacted level. \n\nThis top line includes $88.4 billion in Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) funding for war efforts and is at the level assumed in the House-Senate budget conference agreement.\n\nI would point out our House total is very close to the number President Obama submitted in his FY ’16 budget request for national defense.\n\nOf course, the base funding recommendation is just over $490 billion, which reflect the budget caps enacted in 2011 as part of the Budget Control Act.\n\nTo reach our reduced allocation, we reviewed in detail the President’s submission and found areas and programs where reductions were possible without harming military operations, warfighter readiness, or critical modernization efforts. \n\nAnd please be assured we made “every dollar count.”\n\nTo do so, we’ve taken reductions from programs that have been:\n\nrestructured or terminated;\nsubject to contract or schedule delays;\ncontain unjustified cost increases or funding requested “ahead of need;”\nhistorical under-execution;\nrescissions of unneeded funds; \nOf course, our bill keeps faith with our troops and their families by including a 2.3 percent pay raise, a full percentage point above the President’s request. \n\nIt also provides generous funding to (their) benefits and critical defense health programs. \n\nIn another key area, this package contains robust funding to counter serious worldwide cyber threats – now an everyday occurrence.\n\nBut I think we would all agree that the world is a much more dangerous, unstable and unpredictable place than it was in 2011 when the Budget Control Act was signed into law by President Obama. \n\nThe budget caps developed back then could never have envisioned the emerging and evolving threats that we’re seeing today in the Middle East, North Africa, Asia, eastern Europe and elsewhere.\n\nSo, to respond to current and future threats, and meet our Constitutional responsibilities to provide for the common defense, we developed a bill that adheres to current law AND provides additional resources to avoid catastrophic cuts to military programs and people.\n\nThose additional resources are included in Title 9 – the Global War on Terrorism account.  And that account has been carefully vetted to assure its war-related uses.\n\nOur Subcommittee scrubbed the President’s base budget request for this year and past budget requests and identified those systems and programs that are absolutely connected to our ongoing fight against threats presented by ISIL. Al Qaeda, al Nusra, the Korasan Group, Boko Haram and other radical terrorist organizations, including the Iranian Quds Force. \n\nWe also projected what resources the military and intelligence community will need to meet the ongoing challenge of nation-state aggressors like Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and others.\n\nNot surprisingly, we have heard objections about the use of Title 9 to boost our top line national security spending in this bill. \n\nFrankly, I do not believe there is anyone on either side of the Capitol who believes this should be our first “Go-To” option.  Rather, it’s a process we undertake as a last resort to make sure our troops can answer the call amid a worsening threat environment. \n\nAgain, we have been very careful about what went into this Global War on Terrorism account.  We resisted the temptation to simply transfer large portions of the base bill’s Operations and Maintenance accounts into GWOT.  We painstakingly worked to provide the needed resources for the preparation of our forces in the field, wherever a crisis may exist or develop in the future, like the current unfolding disaster which is Iraq! \n\nIn a recent Statement of Administration Policy, the White House asserted that GWOT funding – the old OCO account – is a “funding mechanism intended to pay for wars…”\n\nI could not agree more and that’s why we reinforced GWOT funding to provide President Obama with funding he needs to lead us as our Commander-in-Chief. \n\nWithin the GWOT account, I want to highlight two areas of critical importance:  ISR and readiness.\n\nWe believe that a strong Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability is a critical component of the Global War on Terrorism.  And yet, a succession of Combatant Commanders have  testified that only a fraction of their ISR requirements are being met, in essence, leaving them blind to the enemy’s activities, movements and intentions.  \n\nAccordingly, the GWOT account contains an additional $500 million above the President’s 2016 request to improve our ISR capabilities - procurement of additional ISR aircraft and ground stations, the training of ISR pilots and other personnel and the processing of ISR-derived data.  \n\nLikewise, we share the concern of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines about the erosion in overall READINESS in the force. \n\nSo to begin to re-invest in readiness, Title 9 includes an additional $2.5 billion above the President’s request for this purpose – to be distributed to all the services and to the Guard and Reserves.  I would add that this sum must be detailed and justified to Congress 30 days before it is spent.\n\nAgain, this bill is structured to give the President the tools he needs to act.  For example, when he does finally develop a long-awaited, “complete” and comprehensive strategy to combat ISIL and other terror groups, we’ve provided in this bill the resources he will need to execute his plans.\n\nI think we’d all agree that America must lead and this bill enables that leadership.  \n\nMr. Chairman, I will allow myself a closing thought:\n\nThe Washington Post recently editorialized on the Defense Authorization bill that “there isn’t much bipartisan governance left in Washington, but if anything fits that description, it’s probably the annual defense” bill. \n\nLike the work of our predecessors, this measure has been developed with the full cooperation of Republicans and Democrats on our Committee with our excellent staff led by our Clerk Rob Blair and his minority counterpart, Becky Leggieri.\n\nPast Defense Subcommittee Chairmen Young, Dicks, Murtha and Lewis, and others, consistently reminded us that we are here for the defense of the nation and partisan politics has no place in a defense appropriations bill. \n\nAs Members of Congress, our first duty is to “provide for the common defence.” \n\nIt is on our shoulders to make sure our troops can dominate any and every battlefield upon which they march.\n\nMake no mistake: we want to work with the President and this recommendation provides him with the tools he needs to fulfill his responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief!\n\nMr. Chairman, this bill deserves bipartisan support and after many hours of productive debate, I look forward to a bipartisan vote outcome.\n\nOur troops deserve it.\n\nOur national security requires it.\n\nOur adversaries need to see it.\n\nI reserve the balance of my time.\n\n###	515102035310499

191509977669708	As our official Congressional delegation left Israel this morning, President Obama was preparing to announce another "framework" nuclear agreement with Iran.  While we have yet to see the critical details, I share many of the concerns raised by Speaker Boehner:\n\n“The president says negotiators have cleared the basic threshold needed to continue talks, but the parameters for a final deal represent an alarming departure from the White House’s initial goals. My longtime concerns about the parameters of this potential agreement remain, but my immediate concern is the administration signaling it will provide near-term sanctions relief.  Congress must be allowed to fully review the details of any agreement before any sanctions are lifted.\n\n“After visiting with our partners on the ground in the Middle East this week, my concerns about Iran’s efforts to foment unrest, brutal violence and terror have only grown. It would be naive to suggest the Iranian regime will not continue to use its nuclear program, and any economic relief, to further destabilize the region.  \n\n“In the weeks ahead, Republicans and Democrats in Congress will continue to press this administration on the details of these parameters and the tough questions that remain unanswered. We will stand strong on behalf of the American people and everyone in the Middle East who values freedom, security, and peace.”	486866018134101

191509977669708	As the new Congress gets underway, I am focused on jobs and the economy and keeping our country safe from violent terrorists. Tonight, the President outlined his plans for the year.  Unfortunately, he missed a chance to tell the American people how he will work cooperatively with Republicans to advance solutions that increase opportunities for all – with more jobs, better wages, and lower health care and energy costs.  And, I was deeply disappointed that the nation did not hear more about concrete steps the President will propose to address the three greatest threats to America today: radical Islamic terrorism, cyber-sabotage and runaway debt.	451790414974995

191509977669708	Thanksgiving 2014: Remembering Those “Not At the Table”\n\nAs we gather with family and friends this week, let us give thanks for those who are not ‘at the table’ for the holidays! The men and women of our armed forces, all volunteers, are serving abroad, separated from their loved ones at Thanksgiving!\n\nWe must never forget that we are a nation at war in Iraq and Afghanistan.  We still have thousands of soldiers, sailors and airmen on the Korean Peninsula, in the Sinai and across the Baltics and Germany.\n\nYes, the list of challenges facing America appears daunting as our country seems to be lurching from crisis to crisis at every turn.  But despite all that we face, we still have the best military, a powerful and growing economy and a fundamental strength and character that will serve us well for years to come.\n\nFrankly, if the attitude of the troops I meet is any indication, America has a bright future.  Those are giving men and women who are willing to serve the cause of freedom.  They, and their families, deserve our thanks each and every day.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!	420896241397746
191509977669708	The message of the 2014 election was that the American people want Congress and the President to work together to develop solutions for the problems facing our constituents.  Yet, just two weeks past that election, the President announced he’s taking unilateral action on immigration by declaring that millions of unlawful immigrants can stay in the U.S. without facing the consequences of violating current U.S. immigration laws.  In effect, he’s jumping them to the front of the line, ahead of millions of potential immigrants who have waited their turn and followed our rules. \n\nIt is absolutely true that the Congress has not agreed on how to legislate reform of the immigration system.  But that does not mean, on a whim, the President can ignore the Constitution and alter existing U.S. law before Congress passes new statutes.\n\nOur immigration system is broken and it needs to be fixed.  That effort must start with working together to secure the borders first!	417786715042032

191640657646128	Today I had the opportunity to honor a group of World War II veterans from New Mexico who are visiting Washington, D.C., this week. They are here to visit the memorials – THEIR memorials – that are dedicated to honor their service and sacrifices. We have about 5,000 World War II veterans in New Mexico, and I appreciate the efforts of the Williamson Foundation for supporting the veterans by organizing this week’s Honor Flight. We must never forget what these and all veterans have done four our great nation.	673137819496407
191640657646128	This week, I was able to spend some time with students from Desert Ridge Middle School who were visiting Washington, DC for the first time.

Chaperoning their trip was their teacher, Randy Martin, who recently won a Golden Apple Teacher Award. Thank you to Randy for all he has done for his students and to the middle schoolers who took the time to talk with me.	670714646405391

191640657646128	Today I reintroduced legislation to create a national Care Corps program designed to provide support for family caregivers and help meet the growing demand for the care of aging and disabled Americans. The National Care Corps Act would place volunteers in communities to work with seniors and individuals with disabilities who need extra support to live independently. Volunteers would then receive health insurance and other benefits, such as tuition assistance.\n\nSeniors want to remain in their homes and they want control over their own health care. Most of all, they want to remain as independent as they can, for as long as they can. The same is true for individuals with disabilities. Care Corps will allow them to keep that independence.\n\nI also had the opportunity to discuss this legislation at a briefing with caregiving advocates who were in Washington, D.C. today to release a new report that provides a national profile of caregivers in America.	670380893105433

191640657646128	Today, I sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch about the Justice Department’s pending review to determine whether the military-style training at the National Training Center is appropriate for local law enforcement agencies like the Albuquerque Police Department. The Center is designed to train federal security forces that protect the nation’s nuclear stockpile but it is also open to local law enforcement in New Mexico, including APD. My appeals to the DOE and DOJ both referenced the President’s efforts to move away from the militarization of local law enforcement. There is no place for tactical armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft, and high-caliber weapons in our local police departments; likewise, we should not be blurring the line between local, community-based policing and the militarized training at DOE’s National Training Center. As we move away from a militarized, local police force, the more successful we will be in restoring trust between the police and the public they have sworn to protect. You can read the full letter on my website.	659998837476972
191640657646128	Today, I had the opportunity to join hundreds of visiting police officers in front of the Capitol to honor officers nationwide who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service.

191640657646128	I understand how difficult and frustrating it can be to work through a bureaucracy, whether it’s a large government agency, a medical facility, or a financial institution. That’s why I hold my constituent services staff to high standards and expect them to aggressively work on behalf of all residents who turn to us for help. We recently helped a veteran, who lives by himself in the North Valley, get a loan modification from his bank. His mortgage payment was cut by $375 a month, which enabled him to keep the home where he has lived for the past 27 years. We have helped hundreds of homeowners get direct meetings with their banks, or work on their behalf with banks. I know how difficult and scary it can be for families to face the possibility of losing a home. That’s why we work diligently on their behalf. Everyone in the community benefits when we can prevent home foreclosures and keep people in their homes. If you need assistance, or know somebody who does, please contact our office in Albuquerque at 505-346-6781.	649824121827777
191640657646128	I met some amazing students today who epitomize everything that is right with STEM education and all of the public- and private-sector investments in these winners of the regional Science Fair. The problem is there isn’t enough investment in these kids. Nine out of 10 schools in the U.S. do not offer programing classes. During my luncheon speech to these students, commercial real-estate and other professionals today, I made the case that we must all work together to prepare kids to be part of the workforce that companies need. Google is doing its part in Torrance County to build that workforce for its new Titan Aerospace plant at the Moriarty Airport. But we need regional and statewide partnerships in order to convince Google to base its manufacturing of its aircraft in New Mexico. And we need to present a united front to other technology-based companies that we are investing in our workforce of the future.	646074248869431

Olga‘s art will hang in the halls of Congress next year and she will get to travel to Washington, DC for a special ceremony honoring all of the winners. Thank you to all of the incredible young artists who participated in this year’s Artistic Discovery Contest. There were so many beautiful submissions, I don’t know how the judges chose just one! It was a pleasure to speak with the artists about their pieces this afternoon and to learn more about the inspiration for their work. All of the participating artwork is still available to see. Warehouse 508 will continue to host the exhibit through April 20. Join me and congratulate all of the artists and this year’s winner in the comments.	641282056015317
191640657646128	Many politicians like to read with students when they visit schools. But how many jump rope? I had a great time today with the students at Manzano Day School.	640346502775539
191640657646128	Like the rest of Albuquerque, I am proud of the national recognition that local teacher Sonya Romero received for her selfless dedication to her students and her community. I was proud to memorialize her accomplishments in a Congressional Record, which I delivered to her today. But rather than make the day about her, Sonya asked me to speak to her fellow teachers at Lew Wallace Elementary and listen to their concerns. We talked about high-stakes student testing, teacher evaluations and the low morale that results when schools are stigmatized by the state’s grading system. I am visiting with many schools this week, including the South Valley Academy, and San Antonito Elementary, and I am speaking tomorrow to the local superintendents from throughout the state. I want as much input from educators and parents as I head back to Washington and engage in the debate over the latest, bipartisan education legislation being considered in the Senate.	639730779503778
191640657646128	I’m proud that New Mexico has been at the forefront of banning discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Many political and legal observers have pointed out that Indiana’s Religious Freedom law, and others like it, gained momentum in response to a case that tested New Mexico’s own Religious Freedom law. Our law, however, prohibits discrimination between private parties, including businesses and individuals. Indiana and other states passed laws that allow that type of discrimination. Perhaps just as important, that same state Supreme Court case cited New Mexico’s law that specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Our law, part of the New Mexico Human Rights Act, was passed and signed by the Governor in 2003 – a dozen years before recent legal challenges in other states.	638602202949969

180280568662135	PEARCE VOTES NO ON FAST-TRACK (TPA)\n\nToday, by a vote of 219 to 211, the U.S. House of Representatives passed, as amended,  its own version of the Trade Act of 2015 (H.R. 1314), a bill to give the President Fast-Track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA).  U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce issued this statement following his vote against the measure:\n\n“Trade has a significant impact on the American economy. As a nation, we know that free trade agreements increase our national output and sales to the countries we hold these agreements with. We still hold a trade deficit; we buy more from other countries, than we sell to them.  This shortfall threatens our economy. At a time when our economy is barely growing, millions of people remain out of work, and even more have given up all together. 96 percent of the world’s consumers live outside the United States, Congress should be striving to promote and expand our exports globally to correct this problem.”\n\n“Many have sold Trade Promotion Authority, known as fast-track, as the way forward to increase our sales to other nations, helping to drive our economy forward. While I strongly support free trade agreements to decrease our nation’s trade deficit and promote U.S. manufacturing globally – I do not believe the fast-track bill (TPA) today provided the guarantees needed, Pearce stated.”  \n\nPearce continued:  “The TPA vote today missed significant principles that need to be included in any such bill, like competitive currency standards, fair trading practices, and including the opinion of the American people. Under the bill today, it will be nearly impossible for one Member, or even one chamber of Congress, to prevent the implementation of a treaty that does not include the principles we all support. The approval or disapproval process within this bill should have further enabled Congress to respond to the calls of the American people once any agreement was completed.”\n\n“Complicating matters, for the next 19 months, the Obama Administration would be at the helm of any trade negotiations. For the past 6 years, this Administration has acted with near reckless disregard for the rule of law and the Constitution. Unfortunately, this is not limited to economic impacts.  The Administration has not explained the death of an American Ambassador and 3 other Americans in Benghazi, unilaterally acting on immigration, or massive land grabs in the West.  President Obama has shown time and again he is willing to set the rule of law aside to achieve his personal goals.” \n\n“The American people must have faith that Congress will act on their behalf.  As written, the fast-track bill does not guarantee that.  Ultimately, that is why I could not support this legislation,” Pearce added.\n\n#NM #USA	918016734888511

180280568662135	Today is a day to honor the memory of countless brave young Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. They fought courageously at battles waged across the world. Some were captured, never to return. Others remain Missing in Action.\nAcross our country in cemeteries, parks, town squares and at monuments, we honor all those fallen heroes—men and women—known and unknown—who answered the call to defend and protect our freedom. I encourage everyone to take a moment today to remember our fallen heroes, and let us also recall and pray for their families and friends, who waited for their return and who recount their loss. May we never forget them or their immense sacrifice. And may God continue to bless our nation with men and women who will always answer the call.	908518329171685

112962521120	It is with great sadness that we mourn the death of Officer Gregg Benner, who was serving his community as a member of the Rio Rancho Police Department.  The loss of any police officer is a painful reminder of the dangers they face each and every day.  Officers like Gregg Benner are willing to step into harm’s way, putting their health and safety on the line to protect the communities they proudly serve.  Officer Benner made the ultimate sacrifice and will be remembered for his brave service both on the Rio Rancho police force and as a member of the U.S. Air Force.  My thoughts and prayers are with Officer Benner’s family, friends, fellow officers, and the entire Rio Rancho community during this difficult time.	10152840862161121

112962521120	Yesterday I visited the Santa Fe National Cemetery to honor all those who served in the Vietnam War 50 years ago.  They endured the hardships, bore the burdens, and made the sacrifices that are part of a long tradition of New Mexicans who have served in the Armed Forces.  For that we owe them a debt of gratitude and we also owe them a long overdue welcome home.  Thank you to all our Vietnam veterans.	10152717385061121
112962521120	On March 7, 1965, a brave group of civil rights marchers set out for Montgomery to demand the right to vote for African Americans. What transpired in Selma as these courageous individuals crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge will forever be at the heart of the American civil rights movement - a moment in our history that captured the attention of a nation and shined a bright light on the struggle for equality. These brave men and women were met with violence as they were beaten by Alabama State Troopers. This weekend I am in Selma to remember all of the people who marched and organized, who stood up to discrimination and intolerance, and demanded the fundamental right to vote.	10152669375181121
112962521120	February 22nd to the 28th is Engineers Week, an opportunity to engage students and spur their interest in the engineering profession.

112962521120	Today House Republicans chose to play politics with Homeland Security funding that is so important to New Mexico and our nation – all in an effort to deport DREAMers, kids who are here through no fault of their own and want to give back to the only country they have called home. Congress should pass a clean bill that funds Homeland Security and take action on comprehensive immigration reform that is good for our economy and good for our security.	10152574336321121
112962521120	As we start the new Congress it is a tremendous honor to serve the people of New Mexico and to have the opportunity to again represent our great state. In New Mexico we are a family, and to solve the challenges we face we need to work together, from every level of government to the private sector. We all have a role to play and I will be working hard in Washington and in the district to diversify and strengthen our economy to provide more opportunities to hard-working New Mexicans.	10152560541956121

I also want to thank past and present members of my congressional staff for their skilled and tireless work on behalf of the people of New York’s first district. I will always cherish the thousands of friendships I have been fortunate enough to make over the course of my service, and I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to serve Long Island families and for the great privilege of having been their congressman.	10153000011409402

7940339401	Earlier today, I released the following statement regarding the President's immigration reform announcement last night:\n\n“The ideal way to deal with an issue as complex and fraught with emotion as immigration reform is through the legislative process.  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership of the House has refused to even consider the good, bipartisan comprehensive reform compromise that the Senate passed in June of 2013.  To repeat what the President said last night, if the Republican leadership of the House doesn’t like what he is proposing then they have a solution that has been presented to them and that they have ignored for 18 months; bring the bill up for consideration and it will pass.”	10152877301744402
7940339401	I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank all of our Nation's veterans this Veterans' Day.  Without their dedication to our country and willingness to sacrifice their lives to protect the freedoms we hold dear, we would not enjoy the world we do today.  We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid.  Take a moment today to thank the veterans in your life.	10152856871019402

7940339401	I would like to wish all of my brothers and sisters in organized labor a Happy Labor Day.  Without the hard work and dedication of organized labor, our country would not be what it is today, and all American workers, whether they belong to a union or not, would be without the rights and protections that have served as the foundation of a strong American workforce.  We would not have a minimum wage, a 40-hour work week, or the workplace safety standards currently in place.  It has been my great honor to work with and represent the men and women of organized labor over the years, and I look forward to continuing to do so.	10152692261414402

Yesterday, I visited KLD Labs in Hauppauge. KLD is a leading supplier of real time machine vision and data acquisition solutions for the transportation and industrial sectors. It was very interesting to see how one of our own local businesses is impacting transportation around the world.	10152644780799402
7940339401	Yesterday I joined Steve Israel and Suffolk County Executive Steven Bellone at Launchpad LI for #LITechDay. I was able to check out many innovative tech #startups on Long Island and discuss with them what #Congress can do to help their businesses grow.	10152644744824402
7940339401	Today I had the opportunity to join with the Long Island Farm Bureau to mark Grown on Long Island Day, a celebration of the produce and other products that are grown by our local farmers.  As the grandson of a potato farmer on Eastern Long Island, I have a deep appreciation for the history and importance of the agricultural community here on Long Island.  The best way for us to help our local farmers and ensure that they can continue to farm is to continue to buy local.\n\nTo find a local farm stand, visit the Long Island Farm Bureau website: http://www.lifb.com/HOME/tabid/221/Default.aspx	10152633516329402
7940339401	This afternoon, I joined staff at the Patchogue-Medford Library, Island Harvest and local children to show my support for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Summer Food Rocks program.	10152630741294402
7940339401	This morning I met with another Freedom School, this time at the Faith Baptist Church in Coram. I read them, "What A Wonderful World" and answered some great questions.	10152630415864402
7940339401	This morning I visited the Freedom School at Stony Brook University  where I participated in their "Read Aloud" program. I read the students a book titled "The Juice Box Bully," a story about respect and standing up for others.	10152627974084402
7940339401	I am deeply saddened by the passing of former White House Press Secretary James Brady. In the years following the assassination attempt on President Reagan that left Brady permanently disabled, he and his wife, Sarah, dedicated their lives to safe and sensible gun policy. Their advocacy culminated in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which for the last 20 years has helped stop guns from falling into the wrong hands. Brady’s dedication to public service and his tireless commitment to protecting innocent victims from the horrors of gun violence will always be remembered.	10152624208314402
7940339401	Last night, I was proud to vote for the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014.  This bipartisan legislation will respond to the critical breakdown at the VA by restoring full and prompt access to medical care for our veterans and ensuring they receive treatment as quickly as possible. We owe it to the brave men and women who were willing to lay down their lives for our country to provide the best care possible upon their return. This legislation is the first step toward meeting our obligation. We have more work to do to restore the confidence and excellence in delivery of care that meets the valor of our troops and the debt we owe to America’s veterans.	10152615227964402
7940339401	Remember to submit your photos for my "Photos of the First" competition by tomorrow at midnight for a chance to see your snapshot as my cover photo. Send photos to PhotosOfTheFirstNY@gmail.com	10152614111644402
7940339401	My thoughts are with the families of the victims of today's #MH17 tragedy.	10152585321074402
7940339401	Washington, D.C.—Today, Reps. Steve Israel (D-Huntington), Peter King (R-Seaford) and Tim Bishop (D-Southampton) issued the following statement:\n\n“Governor Cuomo deserves credit for finalizing an agreement that will avoid a strike, and we have worked with him and both parties over the past months to help facilitate this outcome. When negotiations collapsed, and both sides turned to Washington, we made it clear that the ultimate solution rested at the bargaining table. Since then, we have worked on a bipartisan basis with the Governor and both parties to keep negotiations going, and today’s outcome is exactly what we envisioned.”	10152584814309402
7940339401	Today marks 18 years since the TWA flight 800 tragedy. We will always remember the victims of the tragedy and join their families today in recognizing this solemn anniversary.  We remain grateful to the many first responders, volunteers and communities, particularly those in Center Moriches, who dedicated their time and resources to aid in the search and recovery effort in the days following this catastrophe.	10152584616374402
7940339401	#LIRR\nWashington, D.C.—Today, Reps. Steve Israel (D-Huntington), Peter King (R-Seaford) and Tim Bishop (D-Southampton) issued the following statement:\n\n“We were extremely disappointed to learn that the MTA left negotiations yesterday without presenting their own counter offer. Both sides need to be at the negotiating table non-stop to work out an agreement that keeps the transit workforce on the job and keeps service running for our constituents. Both sides need to do their part to keep negotiations moving forward rather than settling in for a stalemate. A compromise must be reached.”	10152580534454402
7940339401	Please join me in welcoming Banshee Troop 1/71st Cavalry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division to Long Island today to honor LT. Joseph Theinert who was Killed in Action on June 4th 2010. Each year the troops travel via a Boots on the Ground escort from Fort Drum to Shelter Island to honor the Lieutenant for his courage and for his ultimate sacrifice.  We thank Boots on the Ground and we honor Lt. Theinert and the troops of the 10th Mountain Division for their invaluable service to our Nation.	10152572076709402
7940339401	Today, Reps. Tim Bishop, Steve Israel, Carolyn McCarthy, Grace Meng, Joseph Crowley and Peter King released the following statement regarding the current LIRR labor situation:\n\n"We are pleased that representatives from labor and management spent nearly five hours negotiating on Thursday in an effort to ensure the continued operations of the Long Island Rail Road.   We remain optimistic that an agreement can be reached without any disruption of rail service, however, we are troubled that no further negotiations are currently scheduled. We strongly urge both parties to work through the weekend to reach a deal to benefit the diverse ridership of the Long Island Rail Road."	10152572068834402
7940339401	I would like to wish everyone a happy and healthy #4thOfJuly.  Please take a moment today to remember the brave men and women who have served and are currently serving in our armed forces.  Their sacrifices serve as a constant reminder that the freedom we celebrate today isn’t free.  Have a great day and stay safe.	10152556931799402
271424728416	Thanks to law enforcement for quick capture of South Carolina mass murder suspect.	10153455930543417
271424728416	Our thoughts and prayers must be with the nine innocent men and women brutally murdered in a church in Charleston, South Carolina and their suffering families. Every effort must be made to capture the vicious killer. RIP	10153455763908417
271424728416	Today I attended a hearing of the Energy and Commerce Committee which is dealing with extending the 9/11 Health & Compensation Act which provides healthcare and compensation to police, firefighters and construction workers who took part in the Ground Zero recovery effort. \n\nGetting this legislation passed in 2010, more than nine years after 9/11, was one of the most difficult fights I have been involved in during my time in Congress. The program is absolutely essential and it works, treating the brutal illnesses - including rare cancers, blood diseases and respiratory disorders. \n\nUnfortunately the components of this program will expire over the next 18 months unless Congress extends them. That is why today's hearing was so necessary and I greatly appreciate the Committee Chairman allowing me to attend the hearing even though I am not a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The testimony was riveting - particularly the testimony of the doctor who administers the program and the police officers and firefighters who are suffering so badly. \n\nI am committed to doing all I can to extend this program which is why I have co-sponsored HR 1786 to reauthorize the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. The brave men and women who answered the call of 9/11 and put their lives and health on the line deserve no less.	10153440409933417
271424728416	I am honored to have just received the 2015 Congressional Cancer Champion Advocacy Award from One Voice Against Cancer which is a coalition of 50 cancer awareness organizations. The award was presented for my "Leadership and Dedication in Support of Lifesaving Cancer Research, Prevention, and Early Detection." The fight against cancer is a struggle which should be supported by all Americans and I will keep up the fight.	10153437332588417
271424728416	NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton briefed me earlier today at One Police Plaza on the terror threats facing New York City. The reality is that NYC and Long Island remain the main target of Islamist terrorists. I thanked Commissioner Bratton for his regular briefings and for his outstanding service. Following the briefing I stopped at my old standby-Pete's Diner- on Queens Blvd in Sunnyside.	10153435194618417
271424728416	Always great meeting with constituents at the annual Brentwood Puerto Rican/Hispanic Day Parade.	10153432967978417
271424728416	Congratulations to American Pharoah on winning Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown! Terrific, historic race.	10153430627243417
271424728416	I will be on Fox News Sunday at 10:00 a.m. with Chris Wallace discussing the NSA and Patriot Act as well as cyberattacks against the United States.	10153430355848417
271424728416	Last evening, on the eve of the Belmont Stakes Triple Crown Classic, former Congressman Bob Turner and I went to dinner at King Umberto's Restaurant in Elmont down the street from the track. Bob, who is a great guy, was recently elected Chairman of the Queens County GOP and is providing the Republican grassroots with outstanding leadership and direction.  Today's race will be a terrific day for New York and Long Island.	10153429553583417
271424728416	People throughout America must thank and congratulate the Boston Police Department, the FBI and the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force for the outstanding job they did in stopping the deadly Islamist terrorist plot which targeted police officers for beheading.                               \n\nI want to particularly commend Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans for his leadership. I have met with the commanding officers of the Boston PD on a number of occasions, including Commissioner Evans and his predecessor Ed Davis, and they are truly first class. They know what has to be done to protect their city and they get it done.        \n\nThis Boston plot demonstrates how real the Islamist threat is and how the police and FBI must continue to carry out aggressive surveillance to protect our citizens.                 \n\nThank you Boston.	10153424730673417
271424728416	I don't often do this but thanks to Ted Cruz for voting to continue NSA surveillance. Too bad Rand Paul didn't have the same good sense	10153422669478417
271424728416	The overwhelming Senate vote to reauthorize the NSA is a great victory for America in the ongoing war against Islamist terrorism. It is a massive defeat for ISIS, Snowden and Rand Paul. Thankfully the Congress and the American people have seen through all the misinformation and propaganda spread by Rand Paul, his fellow Isolationists and the woefully misguided souls who would follow them over the cliff. God bless America!	10153421295928417
271424728416	Lindsay Graham's entry into the Presidential race is a victory for common sense. Like Marco Rubio, Lindsay is a Senator who believes in defending America. Unlike Rand Paul he is not a clone of Edward Snowden and will not undermine America's security while raising campaign dollars from the maladjusted fringes.	10153418681863417
271424728416	Last night I was honored by the Emerald Legacy Fund which was established in memory of famed NYPD Detective Barney Ferguson who recently passed away and was my longtime friend. I was presented the award for my efforts supporting police, firefighters and the military and fighting against Islamist terrorism. Among those taking part in the program were NYS Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long and the NYPD Emerald Society Pipe Band. It was a great evening being with so many outstanding Americans.	10153413129398417
271424728416	Remembering those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country during the Massapequa/Massapequa Park Memorial Day Parade.	10153387293418417
271424728416	Let us always keep the brave men and women of our Armed Forces in our thoughts and prayers -- especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice. God Bless America!	10153386560183417
271424728416	I strongly oppose President Obama's decision to prevent and restrict local police departments from using military gear to protect local communities and people living in those communities. The reality is that police will be the first line of defense in the event of a terrorist attack and Islamist terrorists may well have access to explosives and heavy duty weaponry. Also as we recently saw in Baltimore, it took military gear and hardware to put down violent rioting and looting. It is time for the President to stand with the police and put aside political correctness.	10153367047078417
271424728416	Over the weekend I visited my good friend Martin Greenfield, who is one of the world's leading tailors, at his factory in Brooklyn. Martin, a survivor of Auschwitz, includes Presidents, Generals and movie stars among his clients and has provided the suits and costumes for such series as Boardwalk Empire.  \n\nMartin is a best selling author and was featured in a recent CNN special on the Holocaust. Martin is a true American patriot who always takes the opportunity to express his love for America. I am very proud to call Martin Greenfield my friend.	10153363584063417
271424728416	Proud to have voted for the Armed Services bill (passed the House by a vote of 269-151) that will provide our military with the funding they need to protect our nation.	10153354885483417
271424728416	Great win last night for the Rangers and New York!	10153352477063417

271424728416	Statement From Congressman Pete King on Tragic Death of NYPD Officer Brian Moore\n\nNYPD Officer Brian Moore died today. He was murdered by a career criminal who shot him through the face and brain on Saturday evening in Queens.\n\nBrian Moore was an integral part of an elite anti-crime unit. He died a true hero. I am proud that he was my constituent.\n\nIt is unfortunate that it takes a tragic murder of a young police officer to remind Americans what outstanding work these men and women in Blue do for all of us every day.\n\nBrian Moore R.I.P.	10153334463998417
271424728416	I will be on Fox and Friends tomorrow morning (Monday) at approximately 8:15 AM to discuss the anti-police bias of the liberal media.	10153333161048417

110262982315	Wishing you all a warm and happy Thanksgiving!  I hope it is spent surrounded by family and all those who make your life special.  Let's remember to give a special thank you to New Yorkers serving our country overseas that cannot be with their families today.	10153696116852316
110262982315	Two years ago, Superstorm Sandy tore up our communities but it brought together millions of New Yorkers and once again reinforced our resiliency.  We will continue to remember those we lost and work to rebuild a stronger New York.	10153631289087316
110262982315	G'mar chatimah tovah. May we all be written and sealed in the book of life. Wishing all who celebrate a peaceful holiday	10153566119862316
110262982315	Congratulations to Munsey Park Elementary School in Manhasset and Glenwood Landing Elementary School in Glen Head for being named National Blue Ribbon Schools for 2014! #NY03 schools continue to be recognized for their commitment to academic excellence.	10153561319032316
110262982315	Today, I visited Kiss Nails in Port Washington to announce the "Bring the Jobs Home Loan Act" to allow the Small Business Administration (SBA) to offer loans to help manufacturers bring production back to the United States for products that they are currently manufacturing overseas. This will help stimulate businesses and the middle class by encouraging companies to invest in American workers.	10153559004942316

110262982315	Today marks the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that took so many innocent Americans from us.  Although it is a wound that will never fully close, New Yorkers continue to rebuild and heal with unparalleled resiliency.  We will #NeverForget those lives lost by supporting their loved ones, thanking our brave first responders, and honoring the men and women who continue to defend us against terrorism.	10153518763197316
110262982315	We need both a short-term and a long-term strategy to degrade, disrupt and destroy ISIL.  The centerpiece must be a new global alliance that employs counter-terrorism measures.  The President's strategy includes this, and I hope Congress will put politics aside and provide the necessary resources to train and equip our partners.	10153517095647316
110262982315	Happy #Chuseok and Mid-Autumn Festival to all my friends celebrating today!	10153511520872316
110262982315	I proudly voted last night for additional funding for Iron Dome so that Israel can protect itself. I am humbled to be traveling to the United States' greatest ally, the State of Israel, to show my support for the Israeli people during this time of instability.	10153422714137316
110262982315	Today I hosted an #Alzheimer's Summit with Senator Jack Martins and Chuck Lavine  where we discussed how we can bring and end to this disease.

617982881546611	The United States Senate has confirmed Loretta Lynch to be our nation’s Attorney General. The length of her confirmation should not eclipse the historical significance of this day; Loretta Lynch will be our nation’s first African-American woman to serve as the Attorney General of the United States. Her confirmation is a testament to her hard work and all that she has accomplished as US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York City. She has prosecuted more terrorists since 9/11—including those who plotted to bomb both the Federal Reserve Bank and New York City’s subway—than anyone else in the nation. This marks the end of Eric Holder’s time as Attorney General, and I thank him for his service to our nation.\n\nhttp://meeks.house.gov/press-release/us-rep-gregory-w-meeks-statement-loretta-lynch-s-attorney-general-confirmation	992595627418666

617982881546611	Today is Equal Pay Day: the date that marks how much longer into this year a woman must work, on average, until her earnings match what a man earned the pervious year. Women make on average only 78 cents for every dollar earned by men – a significant burden on the lives of millions of hard-working women and middle class families around the country. We must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act which will end this injustice and ensure equal pay for women because when women succeed, America succeeds. #EqualPayNow #EqualPayDay	987586324586263

195734010571362	Safety officers play a critical role at New York City schools. They serve as a deterrent to potential crime and ensure quicker response times to emergencies. Students at public schools benefit immensely from the protection that these officers provide, and non-public school students deserve access to this critical safety link as well. That’s why I support the bill (Intro 65) that would allow it. The City cannot risk leaving these schools unprotected. As a mother of two young children and Founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional Kids Safety Caucus, I recognize the importance of creating a safe environment for all students in New York City schools. I call for the passage of this measure, and I applaud Councilman David Greenfield and other sponsors of this legislation for working to keep all of our kids safe.	664921856985906

JEFFRIES STATEMENT ON THE FAILURE OF THE GRAND JURY TO INDICT OFFICER DARREN WILSON IN THE KILLING OF UNARMED TEENAGER MICHAEL BROWN:\n\n“From Ferguson to Brooklyn, the zip codes may be different but the issue of police officers shooting young, unarmed African-American men without justification is exactly the same.  Throughout this country, we need a dramatic change in the manner that law enforcement authorities engage communities of color.  \n\nThe failure of the grand jury to indict Officer Darren Wilson is a miscarriage of justice.  But justice delayed is not justice denied.  We now need the federal civil rights investigation to take center stage, and do the right thing for the family of Michael Brown."	367478410097438

135031389892682	We have learned that the economy added 321,000 jobs in November, the fifty-eighth consecutive month of increases in private-sector jobs. \n \nUnder the leadership of President Obama, our economy continues to expand. \n\nYet many Americans have been excluded from the benefits of the recovery, either as a result of long-term unemployment, in which case they no longer appear in our nations unemployment data or having become trapped in under-employment with wages and benefits that have actually decreased in recent years. \n\nWe have a responsibility to invest in the American people, by renewing our public works and supporting and expanding access to college and job training programs, as well as, research and development that will build the stronger more enduring foundations of an economy in which every American has the opportunity to earn a living wage.	787272608001887
135031389892682	The failure of the grand jury to issue an indictment in the killing of Eric Garner defies comprehension. \n\nEric Garner, a father of six children, was killed when a police officer applied a chokehold, a tactic derived from the martial arts, intended to suffocate the victim. \n\nThe chokehold has been prohibited under police department regulations for more than twenty years. The medical examiner ruled that the death of Eric Garner was a homicide.\n\nWe will not accept the continued devaluation of the lives of men and women who are African-American. \n\nAfter the killing of Michael Brown, in which the grand jury refused to indict the police officer responsible, the killing of Akai Gurley by a police officer in East New York, and similar incidents in every part of our nation, the time has arrived for us to demand reforms to law enforcement practices that are deadly for people of color.	786346254761189

78291598977	Last week I offered an amendment to increase funding for Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) as part of a larger funding bill. With passage of the bill on Tuesday, we ensure that hundreds more individuals, and their families, living with HIV/AIDS will have access to stable housing and other services.\n\nResearch consistently shows that access to housing is directly linked to positive outcomes for people living with HIV/AIDS. It lowers the risk of transmission to a partner by 96 percent, reduces emergency room visits by 36 percent, and cuts hospitalizations by 57 percent. In other words, investing a modest amount in HOPWA today saves millions, if not billions, of federal taxpayer dollars in the future. As the appropriations process continues, I hope we are able to continue increasing funding for HOPWA and other critical services.	10153060480188978

78291598977	Today, Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced that charges will be brought against six Baltimore police officers involved in the death of Freddie Gray.\n\nFor too long, police misconduct, whether police brutality or worse, was often ignored or denied, and the police version of events was almost automatically believed. \n \nNow, with more pervasive cameras and modern forms of evidence, it has become undeniable that we have a real problem in this country with police brutality and false testimony – especially against people of color. In this case, it is gratifying to see that the death of Freddie Gray is not being swept under the rug and has resulted in serious criminal charges being filed against the officers involved. The officers, like anyone else, are entitled to a presumption of innocence and a fair trial, and the victim’s family deserves swift justice. \n \nHopefully we can establish real deterrents for police brutality and misconduct in the future, and will punish it severely when it occurs. \n\nAs we continue to struggle as a nation with how to move forward together to face the very real problems that often exist in police-community relations, we must continue to seek justice for the victims of police misconduct while remembering to respect the significant sacrifices of those who serve honorably in police departments throughout the country.	10152964542733978

We must try and convict and sentence the people who are guilty of acts of terrorism or aggression against the United States or, in accord with our moral and constitutional principles, release those who are not guilty of offenses against the United States. Only so can we restore our national honor. This amendment is necessary to start this process.”	10152963033078978

The Cross Harbor Rail Freight Tunnel project, which I have supported for more than 30 years alongside a large and growing coalition of governmental, business, labor, transportation, and environmental leaders, would finally connect Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, Westchester and Southern Connecticut to the national freight rail grid, profoundly improving the movement of goods throughout our region. It will remove thousands of trucks from our clogged roadways, and that will reduce pollution, reduce the cost of goods and the cost of doing business, grow jobs, and make us all safer by both ensuring easier movement of emergency vehicles and securing an additional route by which we can get vital goods into the region, should our primary route be compromised.\n\nHere is the link to my press release, which includes quotes from many key leaders on this issue: http://nadler.house.gov/press-release/nadler-and-key-leaders-hail-major-milestone-cross-harbor-freight-project-release-new	10152592958658978
78291598977	We have the first chance in more than a decade to finally place some real limits on the sweeping, unwarranted – and at times unlawful – government surveillance that many of us have fought against for the past several years. The Senate version of the USA Freedom Act contains vital reforms that are supported by a broad coalition that ranges across the political spectrum. We must move to pass it into law and not waste this opportunity for real reform. Immediately following the midterm elections, I urge the Senate to pass the updated #USAFreedomAct. In two overwhelming votes, the House of Representatives has shown its support for #NSA reform and I hope the Senate will follow suit.\n\nMy letter: http://nadler.house.gov/press-release/rep-nadler-urges-senate-pass-nsa-reforms-after-elections	10152573744103978
78291598977	First responders and community survivors displayed unparalleled bravery and courage on September 11, 2001, and in the weeks following, as they risked their lives to search for victims among the rubble and to return to their homes, schools and workplaces downtown. I strongly encourage those who have been diagnosed with cancer from exposure to #GroundZero during the aftermath of #September11 to register with the VCF right away by going to VCF.gov. If you do not register by October 14, you will unfortunately not be eligible. These brave heroes labored for weeks in the smoldering ash to clear debris and locate victims. The funds have already been designated for this purpose and it is imperative that as many responders and survivors as possible receive their just and deserved compensation. #NeverForget	10152515848528978
78291598977	I applaud today’s action by the Supreme Court to decline review of the pending marriage equality cases in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin, and I join in true celebration with the many couples who will no longer face harsh discrimination against their families.  While today’s #SCOTUS decisions will pave the way for #marriageequality for many same-sex couples, still far too many lesbian and gay people are being denied the basic right to marry the person they love. This incomplete, but important, step in the march toward justice for same-sex couples is also yet another reminder that Congress must act to ensure full marriage equality. Congress must pass the “Respect for Marriage Act,” which would repeal the so-called “Defense of Marriage Act” in its entirety and ensure that couples who have entered into the lifelong commitment of lawful marriage are treated equally under Federal law regardless of where they live.	10152513358713978
78291598977	Today's unanimous passage of our resolution sends a clear and strong message that we condemn the rising tide of anti-Semitism throughout the world and that we will do all we can to prevent its spread. In 2014 alone, we have seen increased incidents of murder at Jewish sites, violent attacks and death threats against Jews, as well as violence, arson, graffiti, and other instances of vandalism at Jewish places of worship. We must ensure the world views such actions for what they are, the vile and hate-fueled persecution of an entire people, rather than an acceptable expression of frustration with political events in the Middle East or anywhere else. \n\nhttp://nadler.house.gov/press-release/house-unanimously-passes-resolution-condemning-growing-anti-semitism	10152476233603978

7390589055	We’re now voting on two bills that undermine the Affordable Care Act. I'm voting “NO” so we can bring to the Floor a bill to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. Since Speaker Boehner refuses to let the House work its will and bring a bill to the Floor for a vote, we’re forcing the issue on our own. The Bank is critical to America’s competitiveness and that uncertainty over reauthorization is already hurting American businesses. We’ll see if they side with businesses here at home or the extreme, right wing Members of their party who oppose the Bank and are putting American jobs at risk.	10153908614279056

7390589055	Last month’s tragic Amtrak train derailment in Philadelphia was a vivid example of what’s at stake when Congress fails to make critical investments in America’s infrastructure. But instead of making our railways as safe as they should be, Republicans are actually cutting funding for Amtrak: Slashing funding $251 million below the FY 2015 level and $1.3 billion below the President's budget request, forcing Amtrak to defer critical maintenance, and blocking vital capital investments to improve service and safety.	10153870928074056

103355984852	As the facts of the Amtrak derailment begin to come to light, it is becoming more and more apparent that this latest horrific rail accident closely mirrors the Metro North train derailment that took place in the Spuyten Duyvil section of my district in 2013. In both instances, the trains were going too fast, traveling around dangerous curves, and were not equipped with the latest safety technology, known as Positive Train Control. As a result of this same confluence of factors, in both instances the trains derailed, and lives were lost in a terribly tragic way. \n\nOur railways are not as safe as they should be. The Northeast Corridor, which is used by thousands of train passengers every single day, has seen far too many rail related accidents over a very short period of time. This latest incident puts the burden on us to provide the necessary resources to immediately improve rail safety. That includes fully funding Amtrak, making all necessary upgrades on our lines, and retrofitting our trains with the latest safety features and mechanisms. This problem must be addressed, and the time to address it is long overdue.	10153345686919853

103355984852	We have a lot to celebrate this year as we honor the 45th anniversary of Earth Day.  \n \nClimate change can no longer be denied, and the United States is leading the global effort to address its threats. In the last year, U.S. production of solar power doubled and wind power outgrew all other sources of energy.  We have cut our carbon emissions by 10 percent from 2007 to 2013 – the largest absolute emissions reduction of any country in the world.\n\nRenewable energy technologies are not only a tool for combating climate change, but they are also productive drivers of our economy.  While costs for wind farms and solar installations are falling, renewable energy jobs are growing rapidly in everything from manufacturing to installation to maintenance. New York is among the nation’s top three job creators thanks largely to significant developments in the solar installation and energy efficiency sectors.  \n \nAs a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I am working hard to unite my colleagues behind policies that will encourage the development of a clean energy economy, tackle the issue of climate change, and protect the air, water, and ecosystems of our planet.  In particular, some of the legislation I have proposed includes:  \n \n•         The Open Fuel Act to encourage new automobiles to operate on multiple clean fuels instead of or in addition to gasoline;\n \n•         The Hospital Energy Conservation Act to encourage non-profit hospitals to invest in infrastructure projects that significantly reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency; \n \n•         The Offending Oil Polluters Act to prohibit oil polluters from receiving tax benefits for costs associated with cleaning up an oil spill; \n \n•         The Electric Transportation Advancement Act to help develop qualified electric transportation projects.\n\nIf you want to join in the efforts to commemorate Earth Day, please consider contacting one of our many local organizations that participate in the activities that honor the goals and ideals of this day.  \n\nWe have only one planet, so let’s work together to protect it.	10153297463969853

103355984852	Transportation is the lifeblood of New York, and of the nation.\n\nAn affordable and reliable transportation network gets people to work and back to their families. It provides our businesses with the infrastructure to flourish. And it keeps our country running – especially for those who need it most, like seniors, students, residents with disabilities and working families. \n\nBut just as strong roads, bridges and public transportation can provide our cities and towns with a competitive advantage, a crumbling infrastructure can threaten our economic future.  \n\nWorking families rely on affordable and reliable transportation systems to get to work, school, child care, medical visits and community resources, as well as to stay connected to family and friends. Businesses rely on infrastructure to maintain a competitive advantage – to ensure customers and workers can easily participate in the economy. Infrastructure investment generates good jobs for workers in our communities – every $1 billion in federal transportation spending supports 13,000 jobs. \n\nWithout Congressional action, the authorization for federal spending on transportation and infrastructure will expire on May 31.If Congress fails to act on a long-term funding bill, there will be a wave of uncertainty that puts the financial well being of cities and surrounding metro areas in jeopardy. Uncertainty regarding transportation project planning puts a damper on private sector investment – meanwhile, our cities face a competitive disadvantage as the massive investments in public transportation in Europe and Asia are creating the infrastructure needed for a 21st century economy. \n\nCongress must do more to rebuild our decaying transportation networks, and I am committed to working with my colleagues to get this critical bill passed. Too often, the only time we talk about infrastructure is when there is a transportation catastrophe. We see newspaper headlines covering a bridge collapse, a flooded tunnel or a major accident. If we do not act, the potential for additional, more destructive disasters will only increase. \n\nIt’s time for Congress to increase federal transportation investment so we can improve our roads, tunnels, bridges and transit before it is too late. New York’s future – and our nation’s future - depends on it.	10153265726979853
103355984852	February is National Cancer Prevention Month, a great time to make or renew your commitment to putting your health first. Take time to visit your health care professional and discuss your family and personal health history, as well as which cancer screenings are right for you. Screenings can detect cancer early, when it is most treatable, and in some cases stop cancer before it starts. \nIt is estimated that over 589,430 men and women will die in 2015 from cancer.  More than half of those cancer deaths can be prevented by taking action that includes getting screened. \nHere are a few of the most common screenings to discuss with your health care professional:\n\n• Breast Cancer - Mammogram \nWomen in their 20s and 30s should have a clinical breast exam done by your health care professional every three years. Women over age 40 should get a mammogram and have a clinical breast exam every year. Those who have a family history of breast cancer are at higher risk and may need to start screening earlier.\n\n• Cervical Cancer - Pap Smear\nWomen in their 20s should have a Pap test every three years. It is recommended that women ages 35-64 have a Pap and HPV (Human Papillomavirus) test together every five years. If you have HPV, smoke, use birth control pills or have had multiple sexual partners you may be at a higher risk and may need to be screened more often.\n\n• Prostate Cancer - Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Blood Test\nAt 50, men should talk with their health care professional about whether or not getting screened for prostate cancer is right for you.  Men may be at a higher risk if they have a family history of prostate cancer. \n\n• Colon Cancer – Colonoscopy or Stool-Based Tests\nColon cancer is the third most common cancer in men and women in the United States. Starting at age 50, it is recommended that men and women of average risk get screened. You may need to start screening earlier if you have a family history of cancer or colorectal polyps, smoke or are overweight. Talk to your doctor about which screening test is right for you.\n\n• Skin cancer - Skin Exam\nStarting at age 20, have your doctor check your skin annually. Examine your skin at home once a month and tell your health care professional about any changes. You are at a higher risk for skin cancer if you spend a lot of time in the sun or use tanning beds. Always use sunscreen with SPF of 30 or more when in the sun, and avoid the sun at its brightest times.\n\n• Lung Cancer – Low-Dose Spiral CT Scan\nIf you smoke or if you have quit smoking, discuss with your doctor whether lung cancer screening is right for you. Men and women are at a higher risk of developing lung cancer if they smoke (or have smoked) or if they have been exposed to second-hand smoke. \n\nStart reducing your risk to by incorporating these healthy eating and exercise tips into your everyday life style. \n\n• Eat Healthy\nMake healthy living a priority of your everyday life by eating a nutritious, balanced diet. Gradually make small changes to your diet and you will be on your way to instilling healthy eating as a daily habit. Incorporate more vegetables, fruits and whole grains into your diet, reduce consumption of red meats, skip processed meats, reduce your fat intake and limit alcohol. \n\n• Exercise\nMaintaining a healthy weight is linked as a preventive measure for many cancers and can also reduce other health risks. Try to exercise at least five times a week for 30 minutes. \n\nMake healthy lifestyle choices and get appropriate screenings to help reduce your risk of cancer. Share this life-saving information with friends and loved ones to help raise awareness of how to prevent cancer. Learn more about reducing your risk of cancer at preventcancer.org.	10153108182034853
103355984852	This year's flu has been particularly difficult, not only for patients but also for health care providers. The surge in affected individuals is putting a strain on emergency rooms, so in order to help patients and providers alike there are 3 important things the general public needs to do to help combat the sickness and reduce strain on emergency departments:\n\n1) Get a flu shot.\n\n2) If you have flu-like symptoms, call your primary care physician immediately. They will do an initial triage and recommend treatment, maybe even prescribe an antiviral medication. \n\n3) Avoid visiting the Emergency Room if at all possible, unless a doctor recommends otherwise. If you cannot get to your primary care physician, consider going to an urgent care center or other walk-in clinic.	10153081921214853
103355984852	I am deeply saddened to hear about the passing of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo. Mario was a true New York icon, a man of great intellect and oratorical skill. As a delegate at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, I remember how much pride I and the other delegates felt when he gave what is arguably one of the best political speeches in history. \n\nMario's life was the quintessential American success story, the son of Italian immigrants who rose from modest beginnings in Queens to the governor’s mansion in Albany. Having served with Governor Cuomo in the State Legislature I can say there was not a more ardent supporter of the working class. \n\nMy condolences go out to Matilda Cuomo and the rest of Mario’s family during this difficult time, including his son and our current Governor, Andrew Cuomo, who as I watched just today at his second inaugural address, made his father proud.	10153016479164853
103355984852	I strongly condemn the assassination today of two New York City Police officers. This stands as a stark reminder of the terrible risks our first responders face everyday. These officers were executed in cold blood as they were doing their job of protecting us. It is an incredibly tragic situation and my deepest sympathies go out to the officers' loved ones during this impossibly difficult time.  \n \nAs New Yorkers, we are all affected by this tragedy. Instances like this of senseless gun violence have become far too common, and are yet another reason why we as Americans need to get serious about making sure guns stay out of the hands of criminals and those with severe mental illness.	10152973991079853

551199354892891	As we gather together to remember Mario Cuomo, I remember him as a mentor and friend.  As a 17 year old kid, I found myself watching the Democratic National Convention in July of 1984, when Mario Cuomo delivered his Tale of Two Cities speech. For kids like me, whose folks were middle class Catholics, Mario Cuomo was like a trumpet sounding for the values of faith, hard work, family and inclusion -- values we believed in and depended on.  \n \nLater, as a young lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, I had the extraordinary good luck of occupying the office next to his when he joined the firm in 1995. He spent hours with me, sitting across the desk in his corner office or over lunch. Once, after the 1996 presidential election, he asked me what I thought of it. I said, "We won." He then asked, "What have we won?" It's a follow-up question I've never forgotten, and one I ask myself frequently. The answer he taught me: "We've won a grant of time, a short opportunity to do some good." That was Mario Cuomo. His example and big-heartedness continue to inspire me as well as countless other New Yorkers. \n \nOur hearts are heavy with sadness, but for generations to come, his legacy will stay with us. Randy and I offer our deepest sympathies to Matilda, Andrew, Margaret, Maria, Madeline and Christopher and the entire Cuomo family. I pray that our former Governor rests now in eternal peace.	925836274095862

190238567659779	Here’s an update on Trade Promotion Authority (aka “Fast Track”).  Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) was created in 1974 to facilitate Executive branch primacy in international trade negotiations.  Under TPA or Fast Track, Congress voluntarily gives up its ability to debate/vote on amendments to proposed trade agreements.  Under TPA, Congress may only vote “yes” or “no” on the final draft trade agreement negotiated solely by the President. And in the US Senate, under TPA/Fast Track, the proposed trade agreement may not be filibustered.  \n\nSince arriving in Congress in 2011, I have worked hard to restore balance to the legislative-executive branch relationship to ensure the American people get a voice in how our government operates (both the legislative process and with congressional oversight of the executive branch).  For example, I am the author of the “War Powers Reform Act” to ensure that the American people get a voice in the solemn decision on the use of force.  Particularly since the advent of the Nuclear Age, our country has consolidated war powers into the executive branch and presidents of both political parties have taken us off to war without the consent of the governed. That is not how the Founders intended.\n\nAccordingly, I oppose “fast tracking” proposed trade agreements.  My responsibility is to provide a voice for the nearly three-quarters of a million people I represent in Upstate NY.  I will not stifle myself and continue the disturbing trend of consolidating power in the executive branch.  \n\nMoreover, last week I finally had the opportunity to read the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (or TPP, a “Free Trade” proposal for 12 Nations, including the US, that would impact 40% of our current trade).  I am OPPOSED to this proposed agreement as its written.  I do not believe it would be beneficial to our District, State and our country.  I have many concerns surrounding agriculture, small business, workers, the environment, our personal privacy and national sovereignty.  Specifically, given how tenuous negotiations are at this point with regard to export subsidies (this is significant because some of the Nations in this proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement have heavily State-controlled economies that significantly subsidize exports), I’m concerned that TPP could do the kind of harm to agriculture that NAFTA did to manufacturing in our country – undermine the ability of our farmers to compete with our global competitors. I’m confident that if we got a fair trade agreement that put our farmers, small business owners and workers on a level playing field with our global competitors, we would do very well.  The proposed TPP would NOT put us on a level-playing field. \n\nFurther disturbing, our government has classified the draft TPP.  The American people are not even allowed to read it before their representatives vote on whether or not to fast track the proposed TPP trade agreement. This is plainly wrong.  We are a self-governing people and you should be able to read this proposed agreement before these votes.  \n\nThus, I STRONGLY OPPOSE TPA/Fast Track and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nWe are scheduled to vote on TPA/Fast Track on Friday.  Here’s how this will proceed:\n\nThe first vote will be on Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA).  This is a program to help workers displaced by the bad effects of trade agreements.  In the past I have voted to support TAA, however, tomorrow I will vote “NO” for two reasons.  First, there are problems with the “pay-for” for this TAA.  The proposed cuts will adversely impact Medicare.  Second, the way the voting procedure has been established, if TAA is defeated, we will cease all voting on TPA/Fast Track. In essence, if we defeat TAA, we defeat TPA/Fast Track.  In my view, this may be our best opportunity to defeat TPA/Fast Track as more Republicans are expected to vote against TAA, and if the Democrats vote “no” on TAA, we will defeat TPA/Fast Track tomorrow.\n\nShould TAA pass, then the US House will proceed to vote on final passage of TPA/Fast Track.  I will vote “NO” on TPA/Fast Track for all the aforementioned reasons. \n\nI will update you tomorrow (Friday) once these votes have been cast. Thank you.	1116107845072842

This bipartisan bill institutes long-term reforms that save taxpayers money, better serve patients, and return stability to physician payments. \n\nThis bill is good for Upstate New York because it reauthorizes community health care centers, extends full funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), continues the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, helps low-income seniors pay their premiums, and protects payments to doctors who serve patients in underserved or rural regions.\n\nFinally, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that these reforms will reduce the deficit, balancing our commitment to both current and future generations. More work remains, to be sure, but today’s vote is a milestone in our years-long effort to improve the way we deliver health care in our nation.	1071152289568398

190238567659779	I urge you to check out Love the Life You Live, a free women’s conference hosted by SUNY Oneonta, Saturday, February 14 from noon to 5 PM.

190238567659779	We often hear in the news of cases where an individual unknowingly breaks firearm laws in a state in which they are traveling through, despite the action they are taking, or the firearm they are in possession of, being entirely legal in their state of residence. This is caused by the patchwork of concealed carry laws and reciprocity agreements across our nation, with limited federal oversight despite our constitutional obligation to oversee interstate commerce.  When speaking about this issue, the case of Shaneen Allen from Philadelphia comes to mind.  This mother of two had a concealed carry permit in Pennsylvania and, while travelling in New Jersey, was pulled over for a routine traffic stop.  During this stop, she willingly volunteered that she possessed a firearm and showed her PA concealed carry permit.  Shaneen was then arrested because PA and NJ do not have a reciprocity agreement.  Fortunately, her charges have been lessened from a felony and mandatory sentencing of three years in prison after changes to the relevant legal statutes were made by the NJ Attorney General.  Despite the changes in her specific case, her family has now felt irreparable financial and legal repercussions from this situation, not to mention emotional stress.\n\nJust like the lack of an agreement between PA and NJ, New York is an example of a state that recognizes no other concealed carry permits and whose permits are also only recognized by a limited number of other states, including only one bordering state. This disparity means that New Yorkers legally permitted to carry concealed firearms are denied this legal right and corresponding constitutional protections in almost every scenario beyond New York’s borders.\n\nIn order to bring more clarity to the law for legal concealed carry firearm owners across the country like Shaneen Allen, I have joined with 35 bipartisan colleagues to co-author and introduce H.R. 402, the National Right to Carry Reciprocity Act.  This bill will allow individuals like Shaneen who are not prohibited under federal law from carrying a concealed firearm and are permitted to do so in their state of residence to do so across state lines as long as the state to which or within which they are traveling permits concealed carry for its residents, either through a permitting or licensing process or by default.  All those benefiting from this legislation must conform to all other relevant federal, state, and local laws pertaining to the carrying or transporting of firearms.\n\nThe New York State SAFE Act turns two years old this month, but no one is any safer.  We will continue to fight this flawed legislation, which only served to punish legal gun owners and has not made us safer.  As a parent, my first responsibility is to do everything in my power to keep my family safe, but this law does not do so and arguably has made us less safe.  Furthermore, I believe that more needs to be done at the federal level to continue to secure our Second Amendment rights and to protect them from infringements.  H.R. 402 will be an important step forward, and I am hopeful that we will pass it with bipartisan support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate during the 114th Congress.	1031308143552813
190238567659779	We continue our efforts to advance legislation that honors the service of our nation's veterans. I am pleased to announce that yesterday the House passed the Hire More Heroes Act:\n\nhttp://gibson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398332	1022632564420371

190238567659779	The federal spending bill approved by the House December 11 includes $344 million to ensure the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs are developing electronic health records that will seamlessly transfer medical information. I was a leader in enacting earlier legislation on this issue, and I will continue fighting to see that the VA has the resources—and reforms—it requires to best serve our veterans:\n\nhttp://gibson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398326\n\nThe spending bill we adopted this week is now under consideration by the Senate, and the President has indicated he will sign it into law. This bill includes other crucial funding to meet our obligations to veterans, as well as vital investments in military infrastructure projects to support our troops and their families at home and abroad.	1001462303204064
190238567659779	I am proud to announce the passage of legislation I co-sponsored called the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, which requires changes to Department of Defense and VA mental health programs:\n\nhttp://gibson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398325\n\nHR 5059 increases access to mental health care by creating a peer support and community outreach program, and it makes it easier for the VA to partner with local non-profit organizations to expedite care for veterans.\n\nThis bill will help a lot of families in our region as more servicemen and women make the transition to civilian life.	1000412233309071
190238567659779	We’re excited that New York is among the eight states selected to participate in a new USDA farm-to-schools pilot program, which allows schools to purchase unprocessed fruits and vegetables directly from local growers: \n\nhttp://www.cbs6albany.com/news/features/top-story/stories/ny-picked-usda-farmtoschool-pilot-project-21571.shtml \n\nThe idea for this program came from farmers in our district. We listened, and we authored an amendment in the Farm Bill that was ultimately signed into law. It makes sense to encourage school districts to keep their food-buying dollars closer to home, providing healthful lunch options that help students connect with local agriculture.	999801143370180
190238567659779	This week the House approved the ABLE Act, major legislation to help improve the lives of Americans with disabilities.

Thousands of families, businesses, and municipalities have received disaster assistance, but our work continues. My staff and I are committed to seeing that all of our towns and villages impacted by this storm have the resources they need to be safe, vibrant communities.\n\nWe witnessed many acts of heroism and bravery, and I am proud to pay tribute to everyone involved in the recovery efforts.

190238567659779	Good news with the President signing into law two bipartisan agreements to make major reforms to the Veterans Administration and fund our infrastructure.  Enacting these bills are good for Upstate New York and it was important that we came together to get things done.  A full list of what has been accomplished in the 113th Congress is below - certainly more to do, but we have taken many steps forward to help NY-19.  Looking forward to hearing from you with feedback on this list and other priorities as I travel around the 19th District over the next few weeks.\n\nLegislative Accomplishments, 113th Congress\n\nJob Creation: Growing our economy\n\n• Enacted into permanent law the temporary 2001/2003 tax cuts for nearly everyone in our District. This ensures our families get to keep more of their hard earned money to spend on their priorities, which provides a private sector stimulus to the local economy.\n\n• Enacted a Federal Farm Bill that is creating jobs across the rural economy and advancing the interests of dairy/livestock, fruit and vegetable farmers. The bill strengthens conservation, expands broadband, promotes renewable energy, and fights Lyme disease. \n\n• Enacted an infrastructure Bill to ensure confidence in our roads and bridges, water and sewer systems. This also strengthens employment for our contractors and building trades professionals. \n\n• Enacted a Job Training Bill that will help prepare those who are looking for employment with the skills to fill the more than 3 million jobs currently open and waiting on skilled workers. \n\n• Enacted a Sandy Aid Bill that helps New York recover from the devastating storm, and for the first time, included mitigation funding to protect our people and property going forward (providing federal funds for the “NY Rising” Program).\n\n• Enacted a Water Bill that provides necessary resources to complete important stream maintenance, maintain dams, and procure gauges to warn of potential flooding events.\n\n• Enacted reforms to ensure student loan rates didn't double to allow students and parents to keep more of their hard earned money to spend on their priorities, providing a private sector stimulus for the local economy.\n\n• Extended the authority and secured appropriations for the Hudson River Valley Heritage Area to promote our tourism industry in Upstate NY which represents a vital sector of our local economy.\n\n• Passed in the U.S. House over 40 additional bills that facilitate job creation. These bills are among the over 350 bills waiting on action in the U.S. Senate.\n\nFiscal Responsibility: Getting back to a balanced budget so that future generations get the same choices and freedoms\n\n• Since my election in November 2010, we've cut the annual deficit by about 60 percent.\n\n• Enacted the first federal budget in 5 years, which responsibly replaced the sequester to protect national security and domestic programs.\n\n• Passed a series of bills to finish the work of guiding us back to a balanced budget over time. These bills await action in the U.S. Senate. \n\nCritical Priorities: Working for New Yorkers and all Americans\n\n• Enacted additional resources to combat the public health scourge of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases.\n\n• Passed through the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee my legislation that will significantly change the way we approach Lyme disease to bring about major reforms for chronic Lyme sufferers and advance new research for cures. We anticipate full committee passage this week, and the bill is projected to be on the floor of the U.S. House in September. If passed by the U.S. Senate, which I am urging, Presidential approval could be secured by the end of the year.\n\n• Enacted the Violence Against Women Act.\n\n• Enacted major reforms to improve the Veterans Administration.\n\n• Supported a bill that will help secure the border and deal with the humanitarian crisis in the American Southwest. Floor action in the U.S. House is expected soon.\n\n• Introduced an amendment with Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY) that passed in the U.S. House to defund the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) new capacity zones, which if enacted, would lower our electricity rates. That amendment is awaiting action in the U.S. Senate.\n\n• Authored an amendment that passed in the U.S. House to help combat the heroin epidemic. That amendment is now awaiting action in the U.S. Senate.\n\n• Passed in the U.S. House the REINS Act that would significantly reform the regulatory process to make it more accountable and transparent. That bill is now awaiting action in the U.S. Senate.\n\n• Co-authored a bipartisan bill with Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) to roll back the onerous high stakes testing requirement in our public schools. Common sense, not common core. We are now working on building support for the bill.\n\n• Authored a bill to reform the War Powers Act to ensure the American people get a voice, through their Representative, before we go to war. There are currently 44 bipartisan co-sponsors and we are working to build more support.\n\n• Stood strong on the Bill of Rights, consistently voting to protect our freedoms and privacy.\n\n• Enacted several defense policy bills to provide the resources to protect our cherished way of life and equip and support our warfighters.\n\n• Enacted legislation to increase funding for pediatric research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\n• Enacted legislation to lower flood insurance premiums.\n\n• Enacted a veterans bill that requires public education institutions to give veterans in-state tuition rates as a pre-condition for receiving GI Bill education benefits and that extends the amount of time veterans can receive vocational rehabilitation benefits by five years.\n\n• Enacted a bill that reaffirms the U.S. commitment to enhancing security cooperation with Israel in pursuit of shared objectives, as well as encourages greater bilateral cooperation in the areas of cyber-security and the sciences.	925859114097717
190238567659779	I released the following statement today on the President's decision to authorize air strikes in Iraq.  Having served in Iraq four times during my 24 years in the United States Army, I believe U.S. air strikes are the wrong decision:\n\n "The U.S. should not be escalating action in Iraq.  While I support humanitarian assistance to religious minorities in Northern Iraq, beyond that the U.S. role should be focused on diplomatic support as they form a new government, as required by their Constitution following their recent April election.\n\n "We have considerable leverage to influence Iraq to form an inclusive government that respects minorities and follows the rule of law.  These are the decisive factors to a viable, secure and flourishing Iraq.\n\n "Our leverage, among other factors, includes providing military supplies to support the Iraqi armed forces. The Iraqi Air Force - both fixed wing and rotary-wing - is capable of successfully executing air strikes of their own with material support from the U.S.\n\n "As a condition of providing that support, we must expect political change in Iraq.  Military aid is important to help Iraq defeat ISIL but without political reconciliation no amount of military aid will hold that country together.  Direct U.S. military involvement in Iraq undermines political reconciliation. The empowerment of Iraqi Armed Forces defending a people united behind its government is the only way forward.\n\n "With the Administration's latest statement authorizing U.S. air strikes, I'm concerned that we could potentially re-Americanize this conflict. We should not be conducting air strikes nor should U.S. advisers be involved in combat or imminent threat of combat."	925306820819613

164036221404	A growth of 262,000 private sector jobs in May is great news, but Congress can and should do more to foster an environment of economic growth where real wages rise for the middle-class and those struggling to enter it. \n\nI will continue to work in the House with both parties to advance policies that do just that -- like passing a long-term highway bill, reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, ensuring equal pay for equal work, a rise in the minimum wage, and replacing sequestration with an ambitious budget that invests in a new innovation economy.	10153266260656405

164036221404	I'm glad a few of the priorities I have worked on in a bipartisan and bicameral way were included in the #CROmnibus, including supporting the Glenville Depot cleanup, boosting funding for KAPL, fighting to cure Alzheimer's and enacting a national manufacturing policy. However, I voted NO because a provision unrelated to funding the federal government was shoved into this legislation, making possible taxpayer funded bailouts for big banks once again.\n\nHard working American taxpayers bailed out these banks once. Then we changed the law and said that should never happen again. And yet, this bill reverses that change. I cannot, in good conscience, support a measure that would put taxpayers back on the hook to bail out big banks.	10152821282406405

172284859480630	I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4810, the Veterans Access to Care Act.\n\nThis bill would take steps to ensure that our nation’s veterans are receiving the quality care they deserve in an expeditious manner and put policies in place to establish accountability within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n\nH.R. 4810 would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to allow non-VA facilities to provide care to veterans who have waited longer than the 14-day wait time goal of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA); have been notified that an appointment for hospital care or medical services is not available within the goal timeframe; or reside more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility or community-based outpatient clinic.  The bill would also require the Secretary to conduct an assessment of the VA’s hospital care and medical services in conjunction with independent private sector experts to identify specific areas for improvement and provide recommendations to address shortcomings.  The bill upholds the important oversight responsibility of Congress by requiring the VA to provide regular update reports and action plans.  This bill would also prohibit the allocation of performance awards and bonuses within the VA for fiscal years 2014 – 2016.\n\nThe results of an audit that were reported on by the VA Office of Inspector General found that there are over 57,000 veterans that have waited at least 90 days to see a doctor, and another 63,000 who never received an appointment over the past ten years even though they asked for one.  While I am glad to see the VA taking actions to improve and overhaul this clearly broken system, such actions are “too little, too late” so I supported this legislation to push forward additional measures that will bring transparency into the VA’s processes and accountability to those tasked with caring for America’s heroes.  Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to our veterans, and despicable actions that literally put the lives of our veterans at risk are reprehensible and demand action.  \n\nI will continue to support legislation to ensure that the VA has all the resources it needs to properly treat those who rely upon it for their health care needs.\n\nThe bill was passed unanimously by a vote of 426 – 0.	722320954477015
172284859480630	This afternoon I stopped in to visit the VA Outpatient Clinic in Binghamton.  All of our veterans deserve the finest care, and I'm working to see they receive it.	706434636065647
172284859480630	I voted to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress and to appoint a special counsel to investigate IRS targeting of groups based on their political ideology.\n\nMs. Lerner and the Administration have not been cooperative with Congress' investigation into this serious matter.\n\nUsing ideology to target any group or individual is a gross violation of the public’s trust.  The case for a smaller, more accountable and transparent government is as pressing today as it’s ever been.\n\nThe American people deserve answers and safeguards against this ever happening again.  I will work to see that we receive them.	702810539761390

102449199835273	From Southern Tier Red Cross: \n\nHere are some tips for recovering AFTER a flood:\n\n• Return home only when officials have declared the area safe.\n• Before entering your home, look outside for loose power lines, damaged gas lines, foundation cracks or other damage.\n• Parts of your home may be collapsed or damaged. Approach entrances carefully. See if porch roofs and overhangs have all their supports.\n• Watch out for wild animals that may have come into your home with the floodwater.\n• If you smell natural or propane gas or hear a hissing noise, leave immediately and call the fire department.\n• If power lines are down outside your home, do not step in puddles or standing water.\n• Keep children and pets away from hazardous sites and floodwater.\n• Materials such as cleaning products, paint, batteries, contaminated fuel and damaged fuel containers are hazardous. Check with local authorities for assistance with disposal to avoid risk.\n• During cleanup, wear protective clothing, including rubber gloves and rubber boots.\n• Make sure your food and water are safe. Discard items that have come in contact with floodwater, including canned goods, water bottles, plastic utensils and baby bottle nipples. When in doubt, throw it out!\n• Contact your local or state public health department to see if your water supply might be contaminated. You may need to boil or treat it before use. Do not use water that could be contaminated to wash dishes, brush teeth, prepare food, wash hands, make ice or make baby formula!	878679105545608
102449199835273	I have heard from many constituents who are concerned about the President unilaterally negotiating secret trade deals… I share your concerns. \n\nThat is why I support legislation that holds the Obama Administration accountable by providing transparency and oversight. \n\nThis is especially important in the context of trade agreements. #TPA establishes safeguards to ensure that you are NOT kept in the dark, including the requirement that the text be made available to the public for 60 days before any trade agreements can be finalized. \n\nIn addition, Congress must vote to approve every trade agreement. This provides another level of oversight and accountability. If an agreement is not a good deal for the American people, I will NOT vote for it.	876728399074012

102449199835273	This week marked the 5th anniversary of ObamaCare being signed into law.\n\nOver the past five years, the government has spent $42 billion in regulatory costs and over $1.5 billion on a failed website.

Ralph Wilson believed in Buffalo, invested here and remained committed to this community for his remarkable 55 year tenure as owner of the Buffalo Bills. In my encounters with him, it was clear he was a man who knew professional football and sincerely was in it for the love of the game.

Today firefighters not far from Western New York answered the call to save others, as they always do, and sadly became a target.

467047586692268	It was a tremendous honor last night to attend the educational presentation and screening of the inspirational movie American Sniper.

467047586692268	This week was an example of what the American people can expect from the 114th Congress: common-sense and conservative solutions that promote economic growth, job opportunities, and American energy independence. The House passed, H.R. 22, the Hire More Heroes Act, which makes it easier for companies to hire those who have so bravely served our country, H.R. 30, the Save American Workers Act, which changes provisions in Obamacare from classifying full-time employees as those who work 30 hours a week to those who work 40 hours a week, and H.R. 3, which approves the building of the Keystone XL pipeline. \n\nThis is the beginning of what promises to be a great Congress, and I look forward to continuing the momentum we have carried over from the November election.	840443032686053

467047586692268	As we gather with friends and family for the Thanksgiving Holiday, I would like to take a moment to express my gratitude to the Western New York community. The last week has been a trying time for our region, but Western New Yorkers stepped up to the plate.\n \nThe tremendous difficulties created by the recent historic weather disaster were mitigated by the unbridled determination of our residents. Our first responders, National Guardsmen, and every day citizens showed America why Western New York is such a strong community.

I wish you and your family a safe and joyous Thanksgiving, and I look forward to continuing to serve your needs.	814036411993382
467047586692268	I am honored and humbled to receive more than 73% of the vote Tuesday to again be elected by the hardworking people of New York’s 27th District. \n\nVoters across America made a clear choice about the direction in which they want the country to move. Here in the 27th District of New York, like many places across our country, people have chosen to be represented by individuals who believe that job creation and economic growth should be spurred by the private sector, that big government is not good government, and that elected leaders should stand behind the principles they campaign on.\n\nI look forward to building on this nationwide momentum. My focus will remain on the issues that my constituents care about such as ensuring our veterans have the resources they deserve, fighting to reduce burdensome government regulations that negatively impact our farmers and small business owners, protecting Medicare benefits for our seniors, and reducing taxes to keep more money in individual’s pockets.\n\nI want to thank our hundreds of volunteers, our donors and most of all the voters. I would not be here without their strong support.	804336419630048

Continued investment in local infrastructure is necessary to ensure that valuable economic assets like local airports can continue to grow and successfully operate.	781231045273919

274687979233940	The Republican FY'16 budget, which the House will vote on today, is a series of "WON'TS." The budget won't make it easier to climb out of poverty. It won't make it easier to find a job. It won't make it easier to buy a home. It won't make it easier to secure retirement. And, it won't make it easier to earn more money. The party of NO is also the party of WON'T!

212153802255530	Today’s legislation to repeal Obamacare’s onerous medical device tax is a small step in the right direction away from Obamacare and towards a health care system where everyone can get affordable coverage without destroying jobs, hamstringing innovation and raising the cost of life-saving products. \n\nObamacare is a disastrous law, and I will continue to fight to repeal it and protect North Carolinians from its shortcomings while advancing patient-centered reforms.	646514325486140
212153802255530	Given the impact trade deals have had on our state in the past, I am working diligently to ensure any future trade agreements protect vital North Carolina businesses and jobs. Like many of you, I understand the importance of fair and commonsense trade agreements that will help tear down barriers for North Carolina businesses and create more opportunity and good-paying jobs here at home.  I strongly believe that the terms of any trade agreement must be fairly and openly constructed, that long standing and established laws should not be eroded, and that any final trade agreements must empower American workers, manufacturers and producers and create investment in U.S. manufacturing and jobs. This is only possible with TPA.\n \nFor a while now, there have been a lot of false claims, misinformation and confusion about Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and what it means for our country. TPA is a process - not a trade deal - that sets strict congressional parameters for the president to follow in any trade negotiation. Further, TPA empowers you, the American public, to read the text of a trade deal well before Congress votes on it. Without TPA, trade deals are often rushed through Congress without giving folks the opportunity to see what’s inside. \n \nUnder TPA, Congress lays out three strict requirements the administration must follow. First, it must abide by nearly 150 specific negotiating objectives set by Congress. Second, the administration must consult regularly with Congress throughout the negotiations and meet robust transparency standards - including making the text of the deal public for 60 days before the president signs it, so you can read it yourself. And third, before anything becomes law, Congress gets the final say.\n \nBecause of the impact bad trade deals have had on our state in the past, a lot of folks hear the word “trade” and immediately voice their opposition against it. I want to assure you that I share your concerns. But it’s important to reiterate that TPA is not a trade agreement, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which the U.S. has been negotiating since the Bush administration. Further, TPA does not approve TPP. Should a trade agreement like TPP come up, TPA empowers Congress and the American people to review it on its own merits.\n \nTPA does not write a blank check for President Obama or give him carte blanche on trade deals. Established by the Constitution, the president has the authority to negotiate trade deals however and with whoever he wants. TPA puts the American people in the driver’s seat by forcing Congressional oversight. If, and only if, our clear and ambitious negotiating objectives are followed and met, there will be an up-or-down vote on any agreement. If these are not met, a trade agreement can be stopped and TPA can be rescinded.\n \nBut the bottom line is I don’t trust President Obama to unilaterally negotiate trade deals and stand up for North Carolina jobs, and that’s why we need the transparency and check on the president that TPA provides. TPA neither gives the president any new authority, nor does it enable him to negotiate secret trade deals.\n \nBecause of TPA, you will know exactly what’s in the trade deal. Without TPA, only Members of Congress can see the text of a trade agreement during negotiation in a secure room. This isn’t fair, and TPA will bring trade agreements into the sunlight where they belong. The text of any trade agreement will be made publicly available to you 60 days before Congress can vote on it. Additionally, Members of Congress can show up at the negotiations and demand in person briefings from the United States Trade Representative (USTR), and view currently classified text. This is an incredible new level of transparency.\n \nI’ve heard apprehension from some folks back home who don’t like TPA because they simply don’t know what’s inside. The full text of TPA is available online and has been for some time. You can see for yourself here: https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr1890/BILLS-114hr1890rh.pdf.\n \nI will continue to demand an open, transparent and accountable process that focuses on keeping America prosperous and successful for years to come. TPA will help ensure that the U.S. remains competitive in the global market while promoting transparency and fairness. I can assure you, I will continue to do what is right for our communities, for North Carolina and for jobs.	643623602441879

212153802255530	Today the House passed legislation that continues the fight to keep the 440th Airlift Wing at Fort Bragg operating and forces the Secretary of Defense to prove that the closure will not hinder our readiness – an impossible feat. \n\nThis air wing puts the ‘air’ in the Airborne and is vital to ensure our rapid reaction forces are prepared for deployment at a moment's notice.

212153802255530	Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced it will expand the Veterans Choice Program by determining eligibility based on the distance between a Veteran’s place of residence and the nearest VA medical facility using driving distance rather than straight-line distance. \n\nInstead of driving hours to see a doctor, more veterans in our community will be able to receive treatment from private providers closer to home. This is a common sense step to expand access for our veterans, but our work to improve care isn’t done. I will continue to fight for our service men and women so they can get the quality health care they deserve.	622640207873552
212153802255530	As North Carolinians face one of the most stressful days of the year, President Obama will be asking taxpayers to hand over even more of our hard-earned money to pay for Washington’s spending addiction. \n\nI fail to see how his approach will help folks take home more of their paychecks, reduce our debt, promote job creation or provide the economic security working families deserve. Rather than striving for political victories, President Obama should address these worries felt by North Carolina families struggling under the Obama economy.	618583894945850

212153802255530	The one thing the administration got right about Obamacare is it is a big deal – especially for folks struggling to make ends meet because of higher health care costs, fewer working hours and less take home pay. \n\nNorth Carolinians deserve better, and I’ll continue to fight for them to repeal and replace Obamacare with patient-centered reforms that provide quality health care, lower costs and restore the doctor-patient relationship.	606373536166886

212153802255530	As one of our closest allies and the only true democracy in the Middle East, Israel stands on the front lines of our shared battle against terrorism and radical Islam. Unfortunately, President Obama’s hands-off approach to foreign policy has weakened this critical relationship and emboldened our enemies throughout this volatile region.\n \nAs Prime Minister Netanyahu warned Congress and the American people today, a nuclear equipped Iran is the single greatest threat to peace and stability in the world. I remain deeply concerned that this Administration will continue to make foolish concessions to the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, setting Iran on a clear path to develop nuclear weapons. I share the Prime Minister’s view that the only suitable agreement is one that indefinitely ends Iran’s uranium enrichment program and tightens economic sanctions on this dangerous regime.	596106947193545
212153802255530	I’m looking forward to hearing from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning as he addresses a joint session of Congress. This is an opportunity for the American people to hear from the leader of one of our closest allies about the growing threats we face from radical Islam and Iran.\n \nAs your elected Representative, I will continue to be a passionate defender of Israel and work to strengthen the partnership between our two nations!	595987670538806
212153802255530	To push his gun control agenda, President Obama and his Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) proposed a new framework that expands the armor piercing ammunition ban to include ammunition commonly used by law-abiding sportsmen.\n \nI’m proud to join my colleagues to send a letter to the director of ATF demanding answers for this blatant attempt to bypass Congress and the American people. I will continue to fight against proposals that would prevent us from responsibly exercising our Second Amendment rights!	594683860669187
212153802255530	I strongly oppose the FCC’s move to impose heavy-handed, outdated regulations that will grow bureaucratic power and obstruct the free market approach that has allowed the internet to thrive. \n\nUnfortunately, this latest power grab is just another example of this Administration’s liberal, big-government policies that hinder economic growth and stifle innovation. I remain committed to working with my colleagues to put an end to overreaching regulations like these and keep the internet free from government intervention and open.	593790400758533

212153802255530	The EPA continues to regulate at an unprecedented pace, plastering costly red tape on our energy producers while driving energy supplies down and prices up.  \n \nToday, EPA’s Administrator will testify before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittees on Energy and Power and Environment and the Economy as my colleagues and I take a hard look at EPA’s budget and its impact on America’s energy future.

212153802255530	I am outraged the Pentagon has taken premature action to relocate airmen of the 440th Airlift Wing without fully consulting Congress as required by law – this is as shortsighted as it is naïve. \n\nI will continue to fight with my North Carolina colleagues to prevent the inactivation of the 440th AW and protect the jobs and livelihood of the men and women who serve Fort Bragg.	591121064358800

376142742468386	Today in Paris I addressed more than 100,000 people at a major rally for the Iranian pro-democracy movement.

Sergeant Greene was a 10-year veteran of the Sheriff’s Office and also a veteran of the United States Air Force and United States Marines. The day after his passing, I gave a speech in his honor on the House Floor. Today, I presented Mrs. Greene with a framed copy of the speech. \n\nI cannot imagine the pain Mrs. Greene has endured since November, and I admire her courage in traveling to D.C. to honor her husband during National Police Week.

We hope President Obama will learn these lessons of history as he deals with Iran.	804906566258666

8045519803	I want to be crystal clear: I will not support the immigration bill that just passed the Senate.  My first priorities with any reform of our immigration system are border security and no amnesty for law breakers.  I will not vote for any legislation which violates my long-held beliefs.	10151743519804804
8045519803	In the last week it’s been revealed that the Obama administration lied about Benghazi, targeted citizens for their political beliefs, and spied on the press. I take my role on the Oversight and Government Reform committee seriously and we will continue to root out abuses of power in order to provide you with an open and transparent federal government.	10151662287294804
8045519803	As the 114th Congress convened this afternoon, John Boehner was reelected as Speaker of the House with my support. Speaker Boehner has served our Conference under the most adverse circumstances for the last four years leading Republicans as we held the line against the disastrous policies of President Obama and former Majority Leader Harry Reid. While I have not always agreed with Speaker Boehner, make no mistake these previous four years have not lacked conservative achievements including the first consecutive years of decreased federal spending since the Korean War, the permanent extension of tax cuts for 99% of Americans, and now the largest Republican majority in the House since 1929.  With that being said, these are just a start and Speaker Boehner must lead the House to institute more conservative reforms in the coming two years. \n \nOver the past few days I have heard from a number of constituents who have grown frustrated by Speaker Boehner’s leadership and insist change is necessary.  While I understand some of your frustrations, it is important to remember Speaker Boehner was the unanimous choice of the House Republican Conference when he ran unchallenged for the position in November.  Those who wished to oppose the Speaker should have done so then, not today on the House floor as the 114th Congress begins.   \n \nWith today’s vote complete it is now time for Republicans to come together and work with our colleagues in the Republican Senate majority to provide a better way forward for the American people. This means focusing on creating jobs for the middle class, unwinding the disastrous Affordable Care Act which has cost Western North Carolina families so much, and standing up as one Congress against the lawless actions of this President— especially as it relates to immigration.  This will be the first time President Obama has faced Republican majorities in both houses of Congress and it is imperative we stand together united in support of conservative, pro-growth policies.	10153002479024804
8045519803	One of the most rewarding experiences of my job.

8045519803	Tonight President Obama has ignored the results of this fall’s election and gone against the wishes of a majority of Americans.

Yesterday, an Inspector General report revealed the price tag is currently $216 million and the CFPB cannot find documents showing who approved of the project.

409882952423501	The #EPA has clearly overstepped it congressional mandate with its disastrous #WOTUS rule. The Supreme Court declared that Congress needed to define which waters come under the jurisdiction of the EPA. Once again, the EPA has bypassed Congress and the Judicial branch on its way to defining what the law is, how it will be enforced, and how the agency will penalize noncompliance. A bipartisan coalition of House Members have joined 30+ governors and government leaders to reject this overreaching rule. When an agency can define rules that expands their scope of jurisdiction, then we will no longer need a legislative branch to pass laws. I am afraid that day has arrived, but it will NOT be met with silence or complacency. The #EPA's new #WOTUS rule is federal overreach at its worst and will unncessarily burden businesses, farmers and state and local governments.	814019772009815

The Levine Institute announced that it plans to model a national Holocaust artifact-tracing research program for high school students after East Henderson's work.	803065849771874
409882952423501	I had a great time touring Caldwell Community College as well as Caldwell Early College earlier today.

409882952423501	On Friday I had the opportunity to visit the Charles George VA Medical Center in Asheville, NC. We have a responsibility to make sure that our veterans who selflessly served our country are properly cared for.

409882952423501	I had a great time meeting the talented young artists from NC's 11th District this weekend who participated in the annual Congressional Art Competition. Congratulations to our 1st place winner, Colman Woody, whose piece "Subconscious" will hang in the U.S. Capitol for the next year.

409882952423501	Earlier this morning I spoke with students at Western Carolina University in Professor Don Livingston's Congress class.

Thank you for having me, Professor Livingston.	789713267773799
409882952423501	The #Iran framework agreement relies on blind faith and trust in a rogue nation to stay true to its word. Congress must see specifics of the #IranDeal asap. It's troubling to see the President and Secretary Kerry taking a victory lap before a final deal is actually reached. #NoNuclearIran	786608904750902

384164668340890	Over the past six years we have seen lawlessness come from the Office of the Attorney General and after hearing her testimony, it is clear Ms. Lynch would pursue the same lawlessness of her predecessor. When asked about the president’s illegal executive actions on immigration, she stated that the legal rationale used to justify this circumvention of the Constitution was “reasonable”. As a former U.S. Attorney, I know our Constitution cannot be ignored and our laws must be upheld. I hope the Senate will review her testimony and consider the ramifications of their actions.	773664106057609
384164668340890	Very disappointed the president put politics ahead of jobs and the economy today after he vetoed the bipartisan Keystone pipeline bill. The majority of Americans support this bill, and I will continue to support common sense bills that help create a better environment for job creation.	772750226148997

384164668340890	I remain skeptical about yet another extension of the Iran nuclear talks. We’ve had almost a year of negotiations and Iran has shown little willingness to make real concessions.\n \nWe have to ask ourselves: Is another extension better than a bad deal or no deal at all?\n \nAn extension is only acceptable if it leads to a deal that completely shuts the door on Iran’s path to a nuclear bomb. Otherwise, it simply allows Iran to buy more time and relief from sanctions. \n\nThe administration needs to stop giving in to the demands of Iran’s radical leaders to keep tens of thousands of centrifuges spinning and the Arak reactor intact. We should not enter into any deal with Iran if they will not candidly acknowledge their past deceptions about their nuclear activities and dismantle their nuclear infrastructure.	721453967945290
384164668340890	We’ve seen how Ebola will continue to spread across borders if it’s not met with a swift and robust response.\n\nToday in the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, I heard from the administration about what their plan is for continuing to combat Ebola at its source in West Africa.\n\nRather than continuing to throw money at international agencies like the World Health Organization that failed early on, the administration needs to figure out what changes must be made in the future, so that we can protect the American people and stop a future outbreak in its tracks.	716104195146934
384164668340890	It's been 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, which symbolically marked the downfall of communism during the Revolutions of 1989. Thankful for President Reagan's vigilance and courage to continue the fight for freedom and democracy.	714527921971228
384164668340890	Earlier this week, an administration official criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu using profane language. This is not how American officials should behave, especially to our ally, Israel.  \n \nIsrael has stood by us. Israel is our friend, and this is not how you treat friends. The president and the official should issue an apology, and clear the air.	709176229173064
384164668340890	After hearing the national unemployment rate ticked upward, I’m concerned for the small businesses, manufacturers, and people in my district. Through lower taxes, less government spending, and fewer regulations, we can unleash the American economy and produce good-paying jobs. I hope the president will work with Congress to address our economy and get government out of the way to help the struggling people in my district.	660806467343374
384164668340890	I am pleased to welcome this year’s Congressional Art Competition Winner from my district, Talia Wahl. It is great to have her in DC to see her art hanging in the Capitol. Congratulations, Talia!	642633852493969

384164668340890	Charter schools allow for a different approach to education and offer students and their parents the opportunity to select a school that fits their needs. In addition to the great public schools in my district, there are six charter schools serving the local communities. Today I visited the Magellan Charter School in Raleigh, where I toured the campus and discussed some of the unique successes and challenges facing charter schools.	621078697982818

384164668340890	Today the House voted to create a Select Committee to investigate the Benghazi terrorist attack. This administration has continuously avoided providing answers about Benghazi. It's time that all Americans know the truth, especially the families of the victims.	617412681682753

384164668340890	Only two Democrats voted for the President's budget today - yet he continues to criticize alternative Republican proposals that offer real solutions. We need a budget that reduces our national debt and has a plan to balance - not one that increases taxes and spending.	602128963211125
384164668340890	My thoughts are with those in Fort Hood. It's devastating that there has been another tragedy there and my prayers go out to the victims and their families.	598779046879450
384164668340890	Great to see such a large turnout at the Google "North Carolina Get Your Business Online" Event this morning. In order to grow our local economy, we need to get more N.C. businesses online - small businesses that use the web grow and create jobs twice as fast as those that don't. Over 97% of Americans search online for businesses, but only 54% of small businesses in N.C. have a website. Thanks to Google for hosting this great event for small businesses! #GYBO	578465665577455
384164668340890	Happy Presidents' Day! Today we honor the first leader of our country, President George Washington. Washington believed in freedom and opportunity for the people he served and shaped the principles upon which our country still stands today.	576720829085272
384164668340890	Tonight, the House missed another opportunity to address our nation’s fiscal crisis. Right now, we are caught in a vicious cycle of borrowing more to spend more, and in order to get our country out of this downward spiral of debt, we need to recognize what got us here in the first place – excessive spending. This is an irresponsible way to govern, and it is morally wrong.	573688062721882
384164668340890	Today the House passed legislation to support our nation's sportsmen. H.R. 3590, the “Sportsmen’s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act of 2013” will help to promote hunting and fishing on public lands and make sure our sportsmen can continue to enjoy the outdoor activities we love.\n\nIn North Carolina, hunters and anglers produced over 35,000 jobs in 2011 – more than the combined employment of the two largest private employers in the state. They also contributed over $249 million in state and local taxes that year, greatly adding to our state revenue.\n\nI’m proud to support this important legislation - we should be doing everything we can in Congress to encourage and promote hunting, fishing, and other outdoor sports.	570678466356175
384164668340890	There are over 11 million people living in the United States illegally, and I do not support granting them amnesty - these people have broken the law, and they should not be rewarded with citizenship for doing so. If we grant illegal aliens citizenship, it undermines the rule of law and the existing due process of our immigration system.\n \n A short-term approach to dealing with the millions of undocumented aliens in the U.S., like what the Senate proposes, won’t work – it will eventually lead us back to where we are now, just as previous amnesty bills have.\n\nThe House has taken steps to look at individual immigration issues through bills that deal with each problem individually – visas for high-skilled workers, temporary agricultural guestworker programs, strengthening interior enforcement, and verifying work eligibility. I look forward to playing an active role in the coming discussions to find constructive solutions.	567775633313125
384164668340890	Tonight in the President’s State of the Union address, I expect we’ll hear the President talk about the need to create jobs without offering any real solutions. The House has passed dozens of bills over the last year which would create jobs and foster growth – but they have gone ignored by the President and the Senate. The President says that jobs are a priority, but his policies – overregulation, Obamacare, taxing and spending – are killing jobs and creating a culture of government dependency. Our debt is over $17 trillion and we’re already spending at an unsustainable rate, and yet we can expect that Obama will ask for more spending.  The President needs to address the millions of people across the country who are struggling in our economy because of his #brokenpromises. #SOTU	566737200083635

498751820147706	Congratulations Nichole Hanzel, 18, of Killdeer and Lauren Knoll, 13, of Fargo, as they were honored for their outstanding volunteer service during the 20th annual presentation of The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards in Washington DC.  The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, sponsored by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP), named Nichole and Lauren North Dakota's top high school and middle level youth volunteers in February. \n\nNichole, a senior at Killdeer High School, created a youth cadet program for a local ambulance service to raise money for emergency medical care in her small but booming town, to assist at the ambulance squad’s station house, and to give junior high and high school students a chance to learn about emergency medicine.\n\nLauren, a seventh-grader at Park Christian School, has been volunteering once a month for the past nine years at a local homeless center, preparing and serving meals, and visiting with the homeless. She also has participated in several community service events sponsored by her church, school, the Salvation Army and a local animal shelter. \n\nThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program was created in 1995 to identify and recognize young people for outstanding volunteer service – and, in so doing, inspire others to volunteer, too. In the past 20 years, the program has honored more than 100,000 young volunteers at the local, state and national level.	895767460446138

204705339555378	The Obama Administration’s decision to delay key provisions of the Affordable Care Act is a clear acknowledgement of the threat that this law poses to the economy. The fact remains that delaying a bad idea does not make it a good idea; it just changes when Americans will have to deal with it. Callously, that reckoning is being delayed until after the 2014 Congressional elections.\n\nThis disastrous law should be repealed and replaced with common sense reforms that lower the cost of health care for all Americans.	726510080708232

35499336459	I have had concerns about the direction of our Congressional Republican leadership for a long time. In fact, I have often led the fight against the leaders of our party on issues like the Cut, Cap and Balance budget proposal, numerous debt ceiling fights and, most recently, the CR/Omnibus bill in December.  But given the clear message sent by voters this November, I am willing to give this leadership team another chance to heed that message and guide the nation on a path toward prosperity through personal freedom and conservative principles.  I believe there will be several important opportunities for House and Senate leaders over the next few months to do just that: to push bold conservative solutions to the problems facing everyday Americans, and to stand up to the President when he stands in the way of families.  The American people have placed their trust in Republicans one more time, and our leadership must be held accountable to this mandate.	10152956054131460

35499336459	Lois Lerner’s interview with Politico (http://goo.gl/lQQLsf - published today) is a poke in the eye to the American citizens who were targeted by the IRS for exercising their most fundamental right to speak out against their government. Ms. Lerner’s desire to play the victim to the press while refusing to answer questions about her conduct from Congress underscores why the House of Representatives held her in contempt.\n\nThe Obama Justice Department must prosecute Lois Lerner for her criminal actions at the IRS and her blatant contempt of our efforts to get to the truth. Congress must continue to investigate this matter, and Attorney General Eric Holder must appoint a special prosecutor. The American people deserve justice.	10152683224181460

35499336459	They "lost" two years worth of her emails?	10152455085446460
35499336459	I am encouraged that House Democrats will fully participate in the Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi.  This partnership will help foster the type of thorough investigation we need to get to the truth.	10152400999941460
35499336459	Statement from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) on being selected to serve on the Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi:\n\n"I want to thank the Speaker for the opportunity to serve the House and the American people on such an important issue.  The focus of our efforts should be to get to the truth about the Administration's actions before, during and after the attacks in Benghazi in which four Americans lost their lives.  I am confident that with bipartisan cooperation under Trey Gowdy's leadership, we can do just that."	10152374208446460
35499336459	I applaud the decision to move forward with a select committee on the Benghazi tragedy.\n\nI will also push forward with a resolution to appoint a special counsel in the IRS scandal.\n\nWe need to get to the truth!	10152359156026460

35499336459	Lois Lerner testified that she "did nothing wrong", then took the Fifth whenever we asked her questions about her role in the IRS scandal.  She has had plenty of chances to set the record straight and help the American people get to the truth.  Tomorrow, the Oversight Committee will meet to determine whether she should be held in contempt of Congress.  How would you vote?	10152306347956460
313301365382225	Thoughts and prayers go out to students, parents, and teachers at Reynolds High School. Thank you to the first responders on the scene.	711071298938561
35499336459	Here is my official statement on the Lois Lerner hearing (also posted on our website Jordan.house.gov).  Would you support appointing a special prosecutor to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal?\n\n"I was disappointed that Lois Lerner chose not to answer the committee’s questions about her role in the IRS scandal.  We need her testimony to help us get to the truth.\n\nBecause she said in previous testimony that she broke no laws and violated no rules, I cannot see what would prevent her from answering questions and helping us get to the truth, unless there is more to the story.\n\nThe Obama Administration has dragged its feet throughout this investigation, failing to provide our committee hundreds of thousands of pages of documents we requested.  Further, the Administration’s so-called investigation into the matter is tainted by the fact that the lead investigator is a max-out contributor to the President’s campaign.\n\nPresident Obama said during his Super Bowl interview that there was ‘not even a smidgen of corruption’ in the IRS matter.  Given the facts uncovered by our committee’s investigation so far, and with Ms. Lerner’s refusal to answer questions about her role as a public employee, I am now convinced that a special prosecutor must be appointed to cut through the red tape and get to the truth the American people deserve."	10152234121321460
35499336459	Here is a link to the letter we sent to the IRS commissioner asking that he stop the proposed IRS rule that would silence TEA Party groups in Ohio and across the country.  http://1.usa.gov/1lz5dfu. Have you heard about this proposed rule?  What do you think about it?	10152174119371460
35499336459	CBO's latest report projects stagnant economic growth, a declining labor force participation rate, and budget deficits as far as the eye can see, adding to the debt our children will have to pay.  Had Senate Democrats passed our Cut, Cap and Balance plan in 2011, we could have balanced the budget by now.  Instead, Congress continues to borrow and spend like there is no tomorrow.  Unfettered borrowing and spending does nothing to help our economy grow.	10152171608276460

It is time the EPA works with state and local stakeholders to provide a clear definition of waters subject to federal regulation.  The current EPA rule, as proposed, would result in unnecessary and costly regulation of road side and agricultural ditches, municipal stormwater systems, and new home construction, hindering future economic growth.	440090232835070

255037508007011	As a lifelong sportsman, I am deeply concerned about the Administration’s attempt to ban ammunition commonly used for sporting.

255037508007011	The House just passed the Senate Amendment to H.R. 33, which will continue current funding levels for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through March 6, 2015.\n\nThe Federal District Court in Brownsville, Texas, has issued an injunction against the implementation of the President’s executive action, preventing his immigration directives from going into effect. The court ruled that the President and his Administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act and has yet to rule on the constitutionality of the action and the merits of the lawsuit.\n\nIn the interim, we must protect the homeland and fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Today’s vote is a vote to protect America and the American people.	408559835988110
170477096312258	I hear from veterans often about the lack of an official veteran’s identification card. Many veterans who aren’t eligible for enrollment in the VA system simply want a card with their name and photograph, and acts as proof that he or she honorably served in the Armed Forces – as an alternative to carrying around their sensitive military records. I am pleased to tell you that this issue recently came up for a vote in the U.S. House (H.R. 91). The Veteran’s I.D. Card Act passed, and I voted in favor of the legislation. There was not a single “no” vote on this in the House. So, I sincerely hope the Senate receives the message we have sent them, and that they send this important legislation to the president so he can make this a reality.	1123028701057088
255037508007011	Today, the FCC voted in favor of imposing utility-style regulations on the Internet.\n\nResorting to Great Depression-era rules will trigger a stampede to the courts, unleashing years of lawsuits and uncertainty at a time when U.S. leadership and the Internet economy are more important than ever. We believe the Internet has worked well under current rules, but we were – and we remain – willing to come to the table with legislation to answer the calls for legally sustainable consumer protections for the free and open Internet that has fostered a generation of innovation, economic growth, and global empowerment.\n\nRepublicans, Democrats, consumer groups, and investors all agree that we need sustainable protections to preserve the Internet as we know it. A 3-2 party-line vote is not the policy consensus this issue deserves. Consumers, investment in state-of-the-art networks, and job creation all stand to lose from today’s heavy-handed decision. And transparency has all but evaporated during this broken process. Once these rules finally emerge from the shadows, it will become clear that the FCC’s action today does not end the debate.	408092359368191

I had visited both Rock Hill Middle and High School back in April, and it was nice to see some of the same smiling faces looking back at me today. I hope you all had a wonderful trip...please come back again.	1133469303346361
170477096312258	For over a decade, various experts have expressed increasing concerns about cybersecurity in light of the growing frequency, impact, and sophistication of attacks on both private sector and government information systems and networks in the United States and abroad.  Recent cyber attacks in the news – with the Chinese hack of federal employee data just the latest example - have led some to question whether such attacks could have been prevented or mitigated.\n \nTwo legislative proposals on cybersecurity information sharing passed the House in April - the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act, and the Protecting Cyber Networks Act. I supported both of these bills.  With virtually every aspect of our day to day lives dependent upon critical data transmitted electronically (such as health care, financial, and business data), it’s past time for the federal government to get serious about this important issue.	1133309213362370
170477096312258	I was relieved to hear that there were no reported injuries from the fire inside Eramet in Marietta earlier today.  A big thanks to the local fire departments who acted so quickly in bringing the fire under control.	1132983523394939
170477096312258	The Jefferson County village of Richmond celebrated its 200th birthday today.\n\nI was honored the great people of Richmond asked me to say a few words at the program. Today was also Flag Day, and I proudly presented the residents of the village with an American flag flown over the U.S. Capitol specifically to commemorate their bicentennial.	1132477210112237
170477096312258	I'll be heading back tomorrow to Washington, and I anticipate it being a very busy week. What message would you like me to take back to share with my colleagues?	1127109357315689
170477096312258	If you stopped at the Speedway in Lore City recently and thought you saw me working at the register…you did. It was an interesting and enjoyable experience working “undercover” and speaking with customers there. In Washington, we hear a lot about numbers and statistics, but it’s just as important, if not more so, to get out and see firsthand the impacts that policies are having on the hardworking people back home, and to listen to the feedback of those affected.\n\nThanks to all the Speedway store employees and corporate staff for training me on their register system, their hospitality, and allowing me the opportunity to work with them.	1125788737447751
170477096312258	71 years ago today – June 6, 1944 - the course of history was changed forever by brave American heroes who, along with other Allied Forces, landed on the beaches of Normandy in France to rid the world of Hitler’s tyranny. Thousands of American soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice that day in the quest to advance the cause of freedom and liberty. Today, we honor the sacrifices they made for all mankind.	1124994070860551

170477096312258	It was great to meet with students from Little Hocking Elementary School (Warren Local School District) yesterday during the first day of their class trip to Washington, DC. I spoke with them about how important it is that they understand what makes America great, and how they must be ready to take the reigns of leadership when their time comes. They were an enthusiastic bunch, and I was encouraged at their excitement to get a first-hand view of their government in action. Enjoy the rest of your trip!	1123389721020986

170477096312258	During a recent day of stops in Carroll County, I toured both the offices and the Browse and Buy Store at Community Hospice in Carrollton. During the tour, the staff and many of the numerous volunteers shared with me the ways in which they serve patients in Carroll and surrounding counties.  I left feeling fortunate to have a facility with such outstanding and caring volunteers here in Eastern Ohio.	1122202381139720
170477096312258	I was happy to present, and help raise, a new American flag to St. Benedict’s Elementary School in Cambridge this afternoon. I spoke to the students about the importance of our flag, what the stars and stripes on the flag represent, and the pride we should all feel when we see the American flag flying.	1118775911482367
170477096312258	My first stop this morning was at Steubenville High School, where I spoke with a group of very enthusiastic and engaged juniors.  Recently, some students from the school were in Washington D.C. for a visit, and they asked if I could stop at their school when I was nearby. We had a great discussion, and I really appreciate the opportunity. Thanks for the invitation to come meet with you.	1116715951688363
170477096312258	Today is Armed Forces Day, a day to honor and thank men and women from Ohio and across the country, past and present, for their service and sacrifice. Thank you, and God Bless you and your families.	1113817528644872

The full results will be announced this afternoon.	1108369442523014
170477096312258	This morning, I traveled down to Gallipolis to speak with county veterans service officers (VSO’s) from District 10, which includes Gallia, Lawrence, Jackson, and Scioto counties.\n \nAfter I gave a brief overview on some of the latest veterans-related legislation in Washington, I heard direct feedback from the VSO’s about some of the successes and challenges veterans are currently experiencing. I was also pleased to see the Director of the Huntington VAMC, Dr. Nimmo, also made the trip for this meeting. Thanks for the invitation to attend.	1100488289977796
170477096312258	I'm very happy my wife, LeeAnn, joined me at yesterday's Women in Energy event in Cambridge.  As a strong woman and mother, she brings an informed perspective to how opportunities in the energy sector could improve the quality of life for women all across America...especially those hardworking families living here in Eastern and Southeastern Ohio.  Hopefully, her words inspired those in attendance to take these opportunities seriously. Thanks, Honey!	1098483143511644
170477096312258	Wow!  What a great turnout today at the Women in Energy Summit in Cambridge!  It was especially encouraging to see so many middle and high school students there, asking questions about opportunities for them. The good paying jobs that come with the energy renaissance in Eastern and Southeastern Ohio give our children and grandchildren a reason to stay and raise their families here. Thanks to our steering committee and partners...we couldn't have done this without you!	1098094896883802
170477096312258	I arrived home from Washington late last night after a very busy week. I'm looking forward to this morning's Women in Energy Summit in Cambridge.  But first, I'm hopping on a UPS truck in St. Clairsville to help deliver and pick up packages at small businesses in Belmont County.  Maybe I'll see you around; if so, please say hello.	1097836806909611
170477096312258	Today we remember the six million Jewish people who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazis.  Signed into law in 1953 by Israeli Prime Minister Gurion, Holocaust Remembrance Day – or Yom HaShoah – began yesterday evening and continues through this evening.  Anti-Semitism has no place in this world, and America must stand firmly with our friend Israel in the national security challenges it faces.	1097211526972139
170477096312258	Earlier this week, I stopped at an Ohio Means Jobs center in Ironton during a swing through Lawrence County. The center aims to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers for the mutual benefit of both, through education, training, and recruitment. The staff there is doing a great job connecting employers with potential employees, and I was thoroughly impressed with what I saw.	1093049544055004
170477096312258	Congratulations to both Jackson City Schools in Jackson, Ohio and West Branch Local School District in Beloit, Ohio who were recognized by the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Foundation for their support of music education within their communities.  \n\nThese school districts have received Best Communities for Music Education recognition because of the hard-work students, teachers, administrators, and the community have put forth in making music education more accessible.  This designation should serve a source of pride to these local communities.	1092419894117969
170477096312258	Easter is one of the most important days in the Christian faith. Today is a time to reflect on both Jesus Christ’s suffering and sacrifice made for each of us, and remind us that God is always with us, in good times and bad. As we give thanks for our blessing, LeeAnn, Nathan, and I wish each and every one of you a very blessed and joyful Easter, and hope you have an opportunity to enjoy some time with your loved ones.	1090440227649269
170477096312258	This upcoming Tuesday, there will be an informal U.S. Service Academy informational session at Zane State College in Cambridge from 6-8 pm.  It's a great opportunity for local students to learn more about the application process, and to meet with representatives of the service academies and ask any questions you may have. I encourage any interested local students to come out and attend.	1089600347733257
191159267565100	This past Saturday, I headed to Massillon for the C.O.O.L. Project, a non-profit group that promotes neighborhood unity by partnering with local churches to repair and beautify Massillon one block at a time.  We got a lot done and I helped build a front porch!  Please visit their website www.cooldays.org for more information.

191159267565100	Last week it was windy, this week it was humid. But I still had a fun visit with Tuscarawas Valley Middle School. We got to talk about the history of the Capitol building, my job in Washington and back home, and the boundaries and interesting things in the 7th District.	1089200914427593
175082565865743	We owe gratitude & continued support to all involved in the successful mission against ISIL.  The United States and our coalition partners must continue to do everything in our power to defeat and destroy these savage terrorists.	982573888449936
191159267565100	FYI - If you need assistance with a federal agency or you're trying to get a passport at the last minute, my office may be able to help.

191159267565100	This evening, I hosted the Congressional Art Competition Reception in Ashland to congratulate the students who were chosen as 2015 finalist. \n\nI would like to congratulate the winner of this year’s Congressional Art Competition, Kiana Ziegler and the runner up Katelyn Reynolds.  http://1.usa.gov/1aRMFUD	1067467396600945
191159267565100	This afternoon, I received the National Association of Manufacturers Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence. \n\nI would like to thank NAM for this award and Ariel Corporation for hosting me today. Companies like Ariel Corporation understand the importance of producing a quality product and hiring the best in the field. This industry is seeing an exciting resurgence in the region and I will continue to support legislation that promotes job creation in Ohio and across the country.	1067415733272778
191159267565100	This afternoon, I attended the Tuscarawas County Chamber of Commerce Luncheon and answered questions on national security, the economy, Obamacare and the Dover Dam project. I appreciate all of your questions and thank you for having me.	1061995477148137
191159267565100	This afternoon, I was the Keynote Speaker for the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Dover Dam.  I would like to thank Colonel Parrott of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District and Tuscarawas County for their work on this important project.	1061433600537658
191159267565100	The U.S. must support our allies now, more than ever and I am pleased the relationship between Afghanistan and the United States continues to grow. I appreciate President Ghani’s heartfelt tribute to our troops and gratitude towards the U.S. I am encouraged by Afghanistan’s commitment to improving their national security and growing their democracy. They are now on a path to become financially stable and I applaud the President on his work and commitment on women’s equality in Afghanistan. I would like to thank President Ghani for speaking to a joint session of Congress and I commend his commitment to bringing peace and stability to the region.	1058204394193912

175082565865743	Iran continues to unjustly imprison and abuse at least three Americans: a Christian pastor, a former U.S. Marine, and a journalist.  They must all be allowed to come home to their families immediately.  This should be a condition of any potential agreement the Obama administration discusses with Iran.	1008004772573514
175082565865743	You deserve to know that moments ago, far more Democrats voted to fund Congress than to fund our troops.  They should join Republicans and vote to give our troops the raise they have earned.	1005857622788229
175082565865743	Sincere condolences to Vice President Joe Biden, his wife Jill, and their entire family for the loss of their son, Beau Biden.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.	1000570279983630
175082565865743	The Obama administration has handed the Castro regime a significant political win in return for nothing.  Relations with Cuba should not be revisited, let alone normalized, until the Cuban people enjoy freedom – and not one second sooner.	999670946740230
175082565865743	Good news ⇒ the House just passed legislation to encourage small businesses to hire more veterans.	986552011385457
175082565865743	FACT: In seven years, President Obama has NEVER proposed a budget that balances.\n\nNow, four months into the new Congress, Republican majorities in the House and Senate worked together to pass the first joint 10-year balanced budget in 14 years.	978699375504054

175082565865743	The House and the Senate are working together to STOP a potentially bad agreement that could pave the way to a nuclear-armed Iran, set off a regional nuclear arms race, and strengthen and legitimize the government of Iran.	978348798872445
175082565865743	Disappointed that the White House seems determined to reward the Castro regime, despite its long history of human rights violations.  Cozying up to the oppressive regime in Cuba is a blow to all who long for liberty and dignity.	965991280108197

175082565865743	President Obama should condemn the recent attacks on supporters of Cuban democracy.  The United States should and must always stand on the side of human rights and democracy against communist tyranny.	962984573742201
175082565865743	This #Easter, as we celebrate the glory of the resurrection, I am heeding Timothy Cardinal Dolan's call to pray for persecuted Christians around the world. \n\nIn Iraq, where I was this week, ISIL has been replacing crosses with Islamic State flags and destroying centuries-old churches. In Egypt, 21 Christians were beheaded after being called "people of the cross." In Syria, some 220 Christians were abducted. And in Kenya, Christian students were hunted down in a massacre that left 148 dead. \n\nAmong those reduced to rubble was the Virgin Mary Church in northern Iraq. We are taught that, at the resurrection, Mary's heart was "filled with joy beyond  all telling ... in faith she waited for that day of light and life."\n\nIt can be trying to wait for life amid such strife. But to consider the empty tomb is to see that love will conquer fear, and that light will always overcome the darkness. \n\nHappy Easter to all.	960647007309291
175082565865743	The parameters for a final deal with Iran represent an alarming departure from the White House’s initial goals. My longtime concerns about this potential agreement remain, but my immediate concern is the administration signaling it will provide near-term sanctions relief.  Congress must be allowed to fully review the details of any agreement before any sanctions are lifted.	959021427471849
175082565865743	Last week, Congress sent legislation to the president's desk that would protect American workers from union bosses who try to conduct ambush elections and collect personal information without consent.\n\nToday, with his veto of this common-sense bill, President Obama once again put the interests of his political allies ahead of the small business owners and hardworking Americans who create jobs and build a stronger economy.	957840980923227
175082565865743	Good news → the House passed legislation that will:\n1. Ensure that seniors have access to their doctor\n2.

175082565865743	Today, the Supreme Court of the United States considered the Constitutionality of ObamaCare’s core subsidies.  The law has raised premiums, forced millions off their plan, and slashed benefits for seniors – all contrary to the promises made by this administration.  It should be REPEALED and REPLACED with common-sense solutions that lower cost and protect jobs.	942238972483428
175082565865743	FACTS:\n\n#TheDress is blue and black.\n\nSenate Democrats are blocking security funding to protect the president’s immigration overreach.	939430626097596
175082565865743	President Obama said at least 22 times he didn’t have the authority to do what he did on immigration. No surprise that Judge Hanen agrees.  We’ll follow the case as it moves forward.  Hopefully, Senate Democrats who claim to oppose these unilateral immigration actions will now let the Senate begin debate on our bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security.	933659883341337
175082565865743	The Islamic State (ISIL) is at war with our country and our allies.  If we are going to defeat this enemy, we need a comprehensive military strategy and a robust authorization, not one that limits our options.  Any authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) must give our military commanders the flexibility and authorities they need to succeed and protect our people.  While I believe an #AUMF against #ISIL is important, I have concerns that the president’s request does not meet this standard.  Now we will begin hearings and rigorous oversight so lawmakers and the public can provide their input.  Ultimately, our objective is to show the world that the United States is resolute in our commitment to destroy ISIL.	928216077219051
175082565865743	The tragic death of Kayla Mueller underscores the brutal nature of the enemy we face in ISIL, a group of terrorist thugs that has brought medieval savagery to the 21st century.  This brave and caring woman lived a life dedicated to helping those most in need.  \n\nOur efforts to defeat this terrorist enemy must be redoubled, for the sake of all of their victims.	927455597295099
175082565865743	President Obama needs to stop making concessions to #Iran and stand strong with the American people, our allies, and all in the Middle East who want peace.	926111684096157
173753129419169	"...in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. \n\nIt is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. \n\nIt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."\n\n-Abraham Lincoln, "Gettysburg Address"\n\nTake time today to remember those who have fought to keep us safe and protect our way of life.	697925537001923

173753129419169	Congresswoman Kaptur sounded the alarm today for U.S. veterans and service members, coming out strongly against GOP-led efforts to cut veterans medical care by $690 million in the FY 2016 Veterans Administration (VA) budget. These cuts would result in an estimated 70,000 fewer veterans receiving VA medical care. \n\n“Our nation’s veterans fought to defend our way of life, and many of them risked everything to do it,” said Rep. Kaptur. “They have earned the best possible care and support. But instead of fulfilling this sacred responsibility, my Republican colleagues have proposed to find budget savings by withholding services from tens of thousands of veterans. These are not people who should ever be subjected to political maneuvers or budgetary games. I urge my colleagues in Congress to pass a budget that does not degrade care for our nation’s veterans.” \n\nFor details about the proposed cuts, see the full release here: http://kaptur.house.gov/index.php/news-15011/press-releases/3400-kaptur-issues-warning-on-gop-plan-to-slash-va-budget	686215724839571

173753129419169	Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur responded to news that Republic Steel will temporarily lay off 200 hourly and salaried employees in their Lorain Hot End Operations facility.\n\n“These layoffs are a terrible blow to two hundred workers, their families and the Lorain community. Declining demand, the biggest reason given for these layoffs, often starts with unfair competition from imports of cheaply made foreign competitors. That is why I continue to fight for fair trade with enforceable labor and environmental standards for every U.S. trade agreement, old and new. I have said it many times: our steel workers in Lorain and throughout the country deserve better. And we must do better for them. To do that, we will need to open closed foreign markets and keep investing in manufacturing for long-term U.S. global competitiveness.\n\nInvesting in infrastructure using domestically sourced steel is step one. High quality steel, which will last for generations, must be used. Improving the efficiency and self-sufficiency of manufacturing facilities is also a priority that will require upgrades to achieve energy savings, especially as advanced manufacturing revitalizes our domestic production including U.S. Steel. Workforce development and Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) must be available to respond to the specific needs of communities and workers laid off by no fault of their own but who find themselves and their families on the brink.\n\nI am encouraged that Republic Steel is working with local USW leadership to minimize this round of layoffs, and that this move is described as temporary. Let us not forget that U.S. Steelworkers have done everything ever asked of them. Their outstanding work ethic built this country. Now our country must fulfill its commitment to them." --MK	667150166746127
173753129419169	More than 120 entrepreneurs, small business owners, researchers and others came out to the“Lake Erie Water Technology Business Summit” this morning hosted by Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and Senator Sherrod Brown with representatives from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Cleveland District Office of the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n\n“Entrepreneurs, small business owners and researchers play an important role in finding solutions to major public problems, such as the watershed and water treatment issues we are dealing with currently,” said Kaptur.“Our goal today was to connect these local leaders with services that can help them find practical applications for their work. This kind of partnership is critical for fostering good science, which has proven to be our best tool in pursuing lasting solutions to these problems.”\n\nThe event included a discussion of federal and state programs that could help small business owners, researchers or other stakeholders to develop and bring a new product or technology to market, including efforts to find and implement solutions to Lake Erie water issues. The discussion also covered nutrient management solutions for the Western Lake Erie Basin for farmers, agribusinesses and municipalities, including a presentation by EPA’s AgSTAR bio-energy program, a research and educational partnership between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nPermanent link: http://kaptur.house.gov/index.php/news-15011/press-releases/3359-kaptur-and-brown-host-lake-erie-water-technology-business-summit	666062120188265
173753129419169	This week in DC I was visited by Toledo Veteran and Jeep Factory Employee Preston Hendricks and his nephew Blake Loy. Mr. Hendricks last saw me before his last deployment and stopped by to visit after laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider at Arlington National Cemetery. Mr. Hendricks currently works at the Toledo Jeep factory. They presented me with a Veterans T-shirt from a recent picnic supporting service families at the Jeep plant.  It was a great visit.	529908170470328

173753129419169	It is with a heavy heart that I extend my deepest sympathy to the Ford family: his wife Cynthia, his children, and his friends and associates. Our community and citizenry holds an abiding gratitude for his lifetime of dedicated and honorable service to us.  He was one of a kind. \n\nMayor Jack Ford gave his life, decade after decade, to our entire community. As President of Toledo City Council, he just kept the beat of the City close to him. With every step, he directed himself to move our community and America forward. \n\nHe made history. As an educator, health professional, and political activist, Mayor Ford became the very first African American Mayor elected in Toledo. He served in the State legislature and understood the interconnections of our City to the world beyond it. His knowledge was hard-earned and unique. With his election as Mayor, he elevated our community to a more inclusive and progressive place. He made us proud.  Jack was all business. He always demonstrated a hands-on, can do attitude. \n\nHe was a master of the City budget and directed his Administration to make long neglected improvements.\n\nEven when not feeling well, he carried forward his duties in a soldierly and persevering manner, earning respect from all who knew him.\n\nI particularly appreciated his genius and wry sense of humor. He never missed a beat. Our entire region has benefitted from his generous and focused life on behalf of others.\n\nMay the angels carry him to a place of peace and rest. He has been truly a good, faithful, and honorable servant. --MK	664785343649276
173753129419169	Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur cheered news today that W Diamond Group has agreed in principle to purchase the Hugo Boss manufacturing facility on Tiedeman Road in Brooklyn, OH.\n\n"An American, family-owned, company has chosen to invest in Northern Ohio textile manufacturing, and that is great news for these 169 workers, their families and our entire region,” said Kaptur. “The Tiedeman Road facility is in a region that has a highly-trained textile workforce and a long history of making top quality menswear, making it a smart investment. I applaud the Williams Family for their ongoing commitment to the success of U.S. manufacturing and encourage others in the industry to learn from their example."\n\nKaptur added, “This announcement reinforces what President Obama showed by coming here this week: Northern Ohio is a perfect place to lay the foundation for America’s manufacturing renaissance. I urge companies and organizations throughout our region to pursue the opportunities he announced as part of his visit, and to reach out to my staff for information or assistance at every opportunity.”\n\nFor information about federal competitions in manufacturing innovation, as well as a brief quote from Mark Milko, President of Workers United Local 10, check out the full release here: http://kaptur.house.gov/index.php/news-15011/press-releases/3354-kaptur-cheers-deal-to-keep-textile-factory-in-brooklyn-oh	664491667011977
173753129419169	I want to commend the President for choosing Cleveland as the setting for today’s event. I, as well as Senator Brown, Representative Fudge, and many of our constituents, were pleased that the President came here to announce the expansion of two major initiatives in manufacturing innovation. This is a region that was built on a strong tradition of manufacturing, and there could be no more fitting place to lay the groundwork for the next renaissance in American manufacturing that will rebuild America’s middle class.\n\nThere are other hurdles we must also address as we work to build a strong middle class. One of the audience members today highlighted this point when he asked the President about Citizens United, campaign spending and the relationship between money and influence in the American political system.  President Obama spoke at length about the problems this creates for our nation’s political agenda, diverting attention away from policies, such as infrastructure and trade reform, that could greatly benefit middle class families. Instead, these issues are distorted and blocked, left to rot on the vine. The President said this is bad for American democracy and the American economy. I could not agree more. We have to do a better job of reigning in the influence these groups wield and restore our focus on serving working families as the guiding principle for our elections and our representative government.\n\nAgain, thank you to the President for highlighting Cleveland and Northern Ohio as a vital region in the rebirth of American manufacturing, and for taking time to respond to questions and concerns shared by people throughout this region. I look forward to building on the momentum we started here over the coming months as we continue to fight for the future of American manufacturing and America’s middle class. -- MK\n\nFor a permanent link to this statement, click here: http://kaptur.house.gov/index.php/news-15011/press-releases/3339-kaptur-statement-following-president-barack-obama-s-visit-to-cleveland	663684597092684
173753129419169	The President’s visit to Cleveland today brings the national spotlight to the Northern Ohio region, a region ready and eager to engage in a real conversation about middle class economics. During his visit he will see the unmistakable and pervasive spirit of innovation and tenacity that is reinvigorating downtown Cleveland and spreading its wings across the region, but we must not forget the struggles many in the Cleveland community still face.\n\nIt is fitting that President Obama will start his day in Cleveland touring MAGNET, an organization that has been a true leader in supporting and advancing Northern Ohio’s manufacturing industry for more than three decades. It has been a steadfast conduit for public-private partnerships and a true champion of “Making it in America” and the American worker. Manufacturers know how to grow the U.S. economy from the middle out.\n\nAmerica has a lot of work to do on major middle class economic issues, including modernizing our transportation system, building infrastructure, solving immigration challenges, and reauthorizing the Export Import Bank, and many others. These are middle class issues where the President would have significant bipartisan support, particularly among Democrats. The same cannot be said of unfair global trade deals that have a proven record of failure and growing trade deficits, harming America’s middle class especially in our manufacturing base.\n\nCleveland has the tools and the leadership needed to drive middle class growth throughout our region, and to make the economic recovery a reality for those struggling families who have yet to feel its full effects. There is much the President can do to further these efforts, and we greatly appreciate his visit to our Great Lakes heartland. -- MK\n\nFor this statement and a preview of the President's announcement today, click here: http://kaptur.house.gov/index.php/news-15011/press-releases/3338-kaptur-statement-on-president-barack-obama-s-planned-visit-to-cleveland	663339183793892

9275036647	#MemorialDay is our annual reminder of the true cost of freedom. Ohio is home to over 900,000 veterans, and our state has a rich history of uniformed service throughout times of war and peace. As we reflect on the meaning of Memorial Day it is important to keep those who are currently serving in our thoughts.

9275036647	I am adamantly opposed to this government shutdown and the sequester that preceded it. I voted against sequestration and have supported every bill that would fully fund the government. \n\nI support the employees at Wright Patterson AFB. Their work protecting our Nation has once again been disrupted. It is outrageous to do this to so many employees who have already suffered from the effects of sequestration. \n\nThe House and Senate must come together immediately and end this budget showdown and the sequester. We face serious budgetary issues and neither brinksmanship nor partisanship should harm our nation, our economy and our military.	10151895156601648
9275036647	I am grateful that members of the House and Senate passed the ‘Pay Our Military Act’ to fund our Nation’s military in the event of a government shutdown. I urge the President to quickly sign this important legislation that ensures the men and women who serve our Country will receive their paychecks.\n\nI have voted for every Continuing Resolution presented in the last week that would fully fund our government and ensure that our uniformed military personnel as well as civilian personnel will receive their pay without delay. I am hopeful that Congress will pass a solution that will end this budget showdown.	10151893214201648

279006440801	In today's House Committee on Education and the Workforce's hearing on child nutrition assistance, I asked Secretary Tom Vilsack about the benefits of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm to School Grant Program. This program engages children in healthy eating in schools while supporting local farmers.\n\nEarlier this year, I introduced the bipartisan Farm to School Act to strengthen this program.  I am proud to be working on this effort because Farm to School supports child health as well as farmer and rancher livelihoods.

Casey, Jr., Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Kelly Ayotte, U.S. Senator Dean Heller, Congressman Bobby Scott, Carolyn Maloney, Congresswoman Jackie Speier, and Congresswoman Susan Davis bipartisan legislation that would protect pregnant workers from workplace discrimination.\n\nThe Pregnant Workers Fairness Act promotes workplace fairness, women's health, and employees’ rights. America's economy is driven by its workforce, of whom nearly half are women. Pregnant women should not have to choose between their health and their job—they deserve to work in a fair, safe, and comfortable environment. Supporting pregnant women in the workplace is not only the right thing to do, it is the just thing to do.	10153445068665802
279006440801	I just released the following statement on Tamir Rice:\n\nToday we are one step closer to receiving justice for 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Thank you, Cuyahoga County Sheriff Clifford Pinkney, for your diligence in this matter.\n\nI urge Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty to act with a sense of urgency and review this tragic shooting immediately.  The citizens of Cleveland deserve swift action. The investigation into the shooting of Tamir Rice has taken too long. Our goal is justice. As Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ‘Justice too long delayed is justice denied.’ We want justice now.	10153443128515802
279006440801	As I've said before, how someone chooses to spend money says a lot about a person's priorities.\n\nThe Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill decreases funding for Amtrak by 18% while drastically cutting TIGER grants - the money our district uses for important projects like the Opportunity Corridor. Other cuts include grants for transit improvements, housing for the elderly, and support for distressed neighborhoods.\n\nThis bill shortchanges job-creating investments critical to economic growth and restricts access to safe, affordable housing for the most vulnerable. It won't have my support.	10153442978500802
279006440801	The 2016 budget says a lot about the priorities of some of my colleagues.\n\nThe Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act proposes massive cuts to community policing services, law enforcement grants, legal services for low-income clients, and priorities important to coastal communities. It also undermines gun safety laws.\n\nThis bill fails to protect the safety and security of hardworking Americans by underfunding critical initiatives that are important to our district. For this reason, I have to oppose it.	10153441322940802

279006440801	Today is a turning point for the City of Cleveland, its police department and its citizens. The City and The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) have come together and successfully negotiated a consent decree. I commend Mayor Frank Jackson, Steven Dettelbach, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, and former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for their diligence and hard work.\n\nToday’s agreement signals a renewed sense of commitment to our community.  I initially contacted the DOJ in December 2012 following the tragic high speed police pursuit of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams.  In August 2014, following unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, I again contacted Attorney General Holder and identified specific items that must be included in the decree to end excessive use of force and improve police-community relations in Cleveland.  Although I have not reviewed the entire agreement, I am pleased to hear many of the reforms released so far: greater accountability, community engagement, officer training and monitoring, among others.\n\nWhat this means to the people of Cleveland is that the City and the DOJ understood the urgent need to come to this agreement.  Sweeping, systemic changes can now be implemented, and together we can start to rebuild trust and a positive relationship between the Cleveland Department of Police and the community.\n\nWhile there is still work to be done, this is a giant step in the right direction.  I pledge my support to the Mayor, the Department of Justice and our citizens to continue the positive momentum.	10153407995835802
90452932937	The average amount of student loan debt is $28,400. More than 12 million families rely on #529plans to help save for college. Today the House will vote on a bill to expand, modernize, and strengthen 529 plans.	10153138284932938
90452932937	Once again the president is proposing more taxes and more spending to create a budget that never balances. His top-down approach of imposing new taxes and mandating higher spending will only increase our debt. We need to look to the future and improve our budget outlook by reining in runaway government spending and stabilizing our entitlement programs, like Social Security and Medicare, in order to grow our economy, care for our retirees, and create a brighter future for our children. I hope President Obama is willing to show leadership and work with us to address these tough issues. We can start by finding common ground to boost our economy and promote job creation by increasing our exports and reforming our tax code so it puts American employers and American families first.	10153084925582938
279006440801	My statement on the #BreloVerdict:\n\nThe decision of Judge John P. O’Donnell to acquit Officer Michael Brelo is a stunning setback on the road to justice for Timothy Russell, Malissa Williams and the people of Cleveland. The verdict is another chilling reminder of a broken relationship between the Cleveland Police Department and the community it serves. Today we have been told – yet again – our lives have no value.\n \nBy any measure, the firing of more than a hundred rounds of ammunition by the Cleveland Police Department toward two unarmed citizens was extreme, excessive, and unnecessary. The same can be said about Officer Brelo’s individual actions. My heart goes out to the families of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams, and to the entire city of Cleveland.\n \nThe December 2014 U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) review of the Cleveland Police Department showed that we need sweeping, systemic changes in how our law enforcement works and interacts with the community. I pledge to continue to work with city officials to help implement these changes.\n \nThe decision may not be what we want but our march for justice continues. We still have a long way to go toward racial equality and justice in Ohio, and in the entire United States of America.	10153399289865802
279006440801	Today’s announcement by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is a victory for all constituents in the 11th District. It just makes common sense. I’m elated USACE will comply with a federal court order and begin dredging Cleveland Harbor. This means shipping can continue without disruption and the drinking water of millions of people is further protected because the material will be disposed of in confined facilities rather than dumped in the open waters of Lake Erie. It’s full speed ahead for common sense and protecting our Great Lakes!	10153394982015802
279006440801	I just had a Q&A session with the 8th graders from Citizens Leadership Academy. They asked great questions on everything from the bills I've passed, what success means to me, the most important issues affecting Cleveland, and the advice I'd give to young people. They definitely kept me on my toes, but I enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nThank you all for visiting! The doors of my office are always open to you.	10153392317100802
279006440801	Many of you have contacted me with concerns about various aspects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and there have been several developments this week pertaining to the status of the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation in the Senate.\n\nAs I have I have stated previously, I oppose granting the Obama Administration "fast track" authority in negotiating the terms of a new TPP trade agreement. There has been a lack of transparency in negotiations to date, leaving the American people in the dark about the contents of the proposed deal.\n\nJobs in Northeast Ohio and throughout the nation are at stake and may be negatively impacted for years to come. Without being consulted, Congress has no meaningful role in either shaping the agreement or exercising its constitutional authority to set the terms of trade policy. In November 2013, I signed a letter to President Obama urging him to restore a more robust role to Congress in formulating the TPP trade agreement.  I stand by that letter.\n\nTo read the letter, click here: http://ow.ly/MXx6G	10153377043485802

279006440801	The Armenian Genocide of 1915 was one of the first genocides in the 20th century.  It is estimated that over one million people died as a result. This act of injustice may have attacked the freedom of the Armenian people, but it failed to strip the Armenian diaspora of their empowerment and resolve for justice and peace.\n\nOn the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, my thoughts are with the Armenian American community of Northeast Ohio and the 11th District.	10153332150530802
279006440801	Today I am proud to announce the introduction of the Breaking Addiction Act of 2015, cosponsored by Representative Marcy Kaptur (OH-9) and Congressman Tim Ryan (OH-13). This legislation addresses a significant barrier to accessing inpatient treatment as our nation grapples with an epidemic of heroin and opiate related deaths.\n\nOnly one out of nine Americans who suffers from substance abuse gets treated. Many of these individuals sought care, but were turned away due to a lack of treatment beds. In 2014, 252 heroin-related deaths occurred in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties. This is unacceptable. The Breaking Addiction Act provides the means to save lives in a responsible manner and it does so without adding to the federal deficit.\n\nThe bill increases states’ flexibility under their Medicaid programs to cover treatment for substance use disorders in expanded or additional community-based facilities. It would specifically facilitate reimbursements to states that cover medical assistance to treat a substance use disorder in an institution of mental disease of not more than 60 beds.\n\nBy utilizing waivers that are required to be budget neutral to the federal government, the Breaking Addiction Act is not only cost efficient but is also expected to result in savings due to system wide reductions in the cost of untreated addiction.\n\nClick to read the text of the bill: http://fudge.house.gov/uploads/Breaking_Addiction_Act_of_2015.pdf	10153329604035802

121560497865	Tonight I voted against the Republican budget because it makes it more difficult for Americans to buy a home, afford a college education and retire comfortably. Proving how out of touch Congressional Republicans are with the issues important to average American families, they had the audacity to increase taxes on the middle class by $2,000 in order to pay for a $200,000 tax break for millionaires. Experts project that the Republican budget will destroy millions of jobs and decrease the United States economic growth – Is this really the direction we want to take our country?”	10153252441887866

These small tributes pale in comparison to the service rendered and sacrifices made, but they stand as lasting testament to our thankfulness.  I am eternally grateful for every service member that comes home, but today I ask you to join me in honoring those who could not return to embrace their loved ones. These heroes will forever remain in our thoughts, and today we can teach our children the meaning of their ultimate devotion and patriotism. #MemorialDay2015	10153355489362938

90452932937	We've always known any vote regarding trade would be difficult. Unfortunately, we need more leadership from President Obama to convince members of his own party that breaking down barriers so American companies can sell their products overseas is good for American workers. Too many are using scare tactics when talking about trade. Unfortunately, not enough Democrats were willing to vote today to ensure transparency and accountability by passing trade promotion authority. It’s time for President Obama to step up and insist on separating fact from fiction about trade.	10153322356042938

90452932937	My full SOTU statement...\n\nPresident Obama’s plea for bipartisanship may have been effective if we hadn’t heard the same rhetoric for the past six years. We haven’t seen any action to follow up on those promises of working across the aisle and this speech wasn’t any different. In fact, the first two thirds of his speech was red meat to a progressive base and clearly contradicted the last third. It shouldn’t be surprising because his entire presidency has been a contradiction between how he has campaigned and how he has governed.\n\nThe president did correctly acknowledge that allowing America’s businesses and manufacturers access to consumers across the globe through trade agreements allows them to compete on a level playing field, boosting our economy and encouraging job creation. To get trade deals done, we need to pass Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to give the administration the ability to negotiate, while empowering Congress to set priorities and demand transparency. I hope President Obama can show leadership among members of his own party to work with Republicans and pass this measure that is beneficial for American companies, American employers, and most importantly, American workers.\n\nHowever, what American workers and employers don’t need is the more burdensome tax plan the president outlined tonight. Instead of reforming the tax code to make it simpler, stabler, and more transparent, he wants to raise taxes to pay for a bigger, more intrusive government. His proposal increases taxes, spending and government regulations, making it harder for American businesses to create jobs. That’s not what this country needs.\n\nI believe in a country that grows because of the ingenuity and dedication of its workers – not one that is stifled by red tape and regulation. One that’s open for business, not one that limits itself. I’m disappointed that the president is unwilling to work with Republicans to tackle some of the most serious issues facing our nation like tax reform, regulatory reform, and entitlement reform, but we do agree that one way to grow the American economy is to pass TPA. So let’s start there and get to work. The time is now.	10153057686692938
90452932937	The countdown is on to the State of the Union. I’m hoping President Obama will talk about ways we can find common ground between Congress and the White House to help grow the economy and create jobs. We could start with his help getting support to pass Trade Promotion Authority so we can consider pending trade agreements to promote job creation. Comprehensive tax reform is something else that we could do to bring stability, simplicity, and transparency for American businesses and families. What do you want the president to discuss?	10153049260332938

121560497865	I stand in staunch opposition to the tonight’s Republican Transportation, Housing and Urban Development funding bill which freezes or cuts critical transportation investments and housing programs that assist vulnerable families in Ohio and across the nation. America’s infrastructure is what allows our private businesses, and in-turn our economy, to thrive. Everyone in our community – from business leaders, teachers, law enforcement to our families and friends – rely on these public investments daily. These are things we may take for granted, but they make life in America what it is today – and this legislation only perpetuates the deterioration of our most critical infrastructure needs.	10153360074682866

I serve on the Military Construction & Veterans Affairs subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations - Republicans and we passed our funding bill with unanimous support.

The bill also funds veterans’ benefits and programs.	812098012203986

404318572981934	I just voted for a budget that balances. Here's why: This budget tells the government to live within its means - just like my constituents and I do when we figure out how much we can afford for groceries and gas each week. \n\nIt gets the government to be honest with the taxpayers and we need more of that, not less, in Washington. Importantly, this budget also balances within ten years, provides for a strong national defense, and cuts $5.5 trillion in spending without raising any taxes. \n\nThat's an accomplishment I am proud of.	801040266643094

460003650715961	Obamacare is forcing people out of their insurance, spiking insurance costs, discouraging business growth, forcing businesses to close or layoff employees, and making people of faith violate their convictions by forcing them to pay for abortion-inducing drugs. I was proud to vote to repeal this egregious, job crushing, government expanding law.  Next, we need to tie Obamacare repeal to must-pass legislation like the up-coming debt limit increase or continuing resolution.  On this issue, the Republican party is on the side of the American people.  We must not relent.	513811185335207

313301365382225	All across Oregon, farmers, ranchers, and other property owners have been wondering what the EPA would try to unnecessarily regulate next. The Administration’s new proposal today-- known as the Waters of the United States rule--would expand federal authority over virtually any water in the United States, including canals, irrigation ditches, and stock ponds. This blatant bureaucratic overreach could drastically increase uncertainty and threaten jobs and livelihoods in rural Oregon.\n \nThe EPA has ignored Congress’ repeated rejection of similar legislative efforts to expand jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act.  Of course, we shouldn’t be that surprised. The agency has tried this before, and they have twice been rebuked by the Supreme Court. Earlier this month, I was proud to support a bipartisan bill passed by the House to stop implementation of this rule and send the agency back to the drawing board. I hope that the Senate will swiftly pass this bill. The economies of rural Oregon and other communities around the country face enough obstacles already. We don’t need agencies in Washington D.C. erecting more hurdles and creating more uncertainty.	885657288146627

313301365382225	In reference to the FCC's unprecedented regulation of the Internet:\n\nResorting to Great Depression-era rules will trigger a stampede to the courts, unleashing years of lawsuits and uncertainty at a time when U.S. leadership and the Internet economy are more important than ever. The Internet has worked well under current rules, but I was – and I remain – willing to come to the table with legislation to answer the calls for legally sustainable consumer protections for the free and open Internet that has fostered a generation of innovation, economic growth, and global empowerment.\n\nRepublicans, Democrats, consumer groups, and investors all agree that we need sustainable protections to preserve the Internet as we know it. A 3-2 party-line vote is not the policy consensus this issue deserves. Consumers, investment in state-of-the-art networks, and job creation all stand to lose from today’s heavy-handed decision. And transparency has all but evaporated during this broken process. Once these rules finally emerge from the shadows, it will become clear that the FCC’s action today does not end the debate.	842849465760743
313301365382225	Looking forward to town halls tomorrow in Grant and Harney counties, my 13th and 14th so far this year alone. First up is a meeting in Mt. Vernon at noon at the Mt.

313301365382225	John Kitzhaber has a long record of dedicated public service but sadly the circumstances of his resignation leave another stain on a chapter of Oregon history. If what we have all read is true, this may well go down as one of Oregon government's darkest moments.  Many Oregonians are left wondering, how much more is to come? Will those who bankrolled what looks like influence peddling be brought to justice, too? Just how infested is our state government?	835656909813332

313301365382225	Happy Thanksgiving from the Walden family to yours! We have so much to be thankful for today-- especially the men and women in uniform defending our freedom around the globe, and their families.	794295377282819
313301365382225	Congratulations to a great season by the Bend Little League team!  Way to represent Oregon and make it to the NW Region Championship game!	740729232639434
313301365382225	Vic Atiyeh left his campsite better than he found it, and he will go down in history as one of Oregon’s greatest statesmen. His steady hand guided our state through turbulent times. Through his leadership, we weathered that storm and laid the groundwork for Oregon to flourish in a whole new world economy. His life of service will impact generations of Oregonians to come. Vic Atiyeh was not only a giant, though. He was also a mentor for me and a very close friend. Mylene and I are deeply saddened by this news, and we send our prayers to Dolores and his family.	731651050213919
313301365382225	Lake County residents-- I won't be able to make it to Lakeview this morning for our planned town hall meeting at 8:15 am at the middle school due to transportation issues. We'll work to reschedule the town hall soon. - Greg	687933747918983
313301365382225	Today, I voted no on raising the debt limit. I'm disappointed that the President and the Senate refused to negotiate with the House on further cuts and reforms to reduce the deficit. Previous debt limit negotiations have resulted in historic agreements that reduced spending. I stood ready to work in a bipartisan way on another such agreement, but the Democrats have been unwilling to discuss even modest proposals to reduce the deficit.	652949238084101
313301365382225	It’s Super Bowl Sunday! Should be a great game! Who's going to lift the Lombardi Trophy, #Broncos or #Seahawks?	648670421845316
313301365382225	Yesterday—with my full support—the House passed the 2014 Farm Bill with tremendous bipartisan support. Watch or read my statement and find out how it benefits Oregonians. http://walden.house.gov/s2014/greg-walden-statement-on-house-passage-of-a-five-year-farm-bill/	647402848638740
313301365382225	Season’s Greetings from Hood River! I hope you and your family have a very Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. As we celebrate, let's remember the brave men and women serving overseas and and their families here at home who can't be with their loved ones for the holidays this year. Thank you for your service today and every day.	629922717053420
313301365382225	We have much to be thankful for today. Wishing you and your family a happy Thanksgiving	617806118265080
313301365382225	Today, we pause to remember the life and legacy of President John F. Kennedy. His call to “ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country” still rings true. \n\nAlthough I was only six years old, I vividly remember November 22, 1963. I was at Dry Hollow Elementary in The Dalles when my teacher came into the room in tears and sent us all home. My family and I were glued to our black and white television set for the next several days. I remember trying to understand what it all meant as a six year old, but I knew something awful had happened to the country. \n\nDo you remember where you were 50 years ago today?	614784955233863
313301365382225	This temporary plan does nothing to address the epic problem: spending borrowed money we don’t have and cannot sustain. It kicks the can down the road yet again for only three months, and we’ll be right back where we ended up this week. Enough is enough. Every day, families throughout Oregon and the country sit down around their kitchen tables to balance their budgets and discuss crises and practical ways to resolve them. It’s long overdue that Washington, D.C. do the same.	596655750380117
313301365382225	The House has repeatedly made offers to the Senate to keep the government open, delay Obamacare, and make sure members of Congress and the Administration don’t get special treatment. It’s time for the Senate to come to the table and join us in finding a solution.	589236787788680
313301365382225	In addition to remembering the victims of the attacks of September 11, 2001, we must never forget our fellow citizens who lost their lives one year ago today in Benghazi. The killing of our Ambassador and three other Americans, including Tyrone Woods from Oregon, remind us how fragile the freedom we enjoy really is. \n\nWe owe it to the families of the heroes who lost their lives—and to the American people—to get the truth of what happened. Four Americans died in this terrorist attack, and my colleagues and I will continue to do whatever is necessary to get answers.	580694415309584
94324364811	Today I joined Senator Barbara Boxer, Senator Richard Blumenthal and Top Chef judge Tom Colicchio to introduce a bill to require the labeling of genetically modified foods. It's simple: consumers have a right to know what's in the food they eat. Major food manufacturers are pouring tens of millions of dollars into advertising and lobbying to defeat our national standard and they use scare tactics, like telling you that labels will raise the cost of food. That's baloney. Those same U.S. food companies already label GMOs in more than 60 countries (including members of the EU, Russia and China). American families should get the same choice. #justlabelit	10153062181709812
94324364811	A year and a half after an oil train explosion killed 47 people in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, federal regulators here in the US have yet to issue new safety recommendations for tank cars.  It’s time for the federal agencies to stop stalling. Today, I called on the U.S. Dept. of Transportation to make the long-overdue recommendations a priority in order to keep our communities safe and to give the industry the guidance it’s been asking for. To read more about this issue, I encourage you to visit the House Transportation & Infrastructure Democrats Facebook page.	10153010133844812
94324364811	Five years ago today, the Supreme Court handed down an astounding ruling that gave corporations the same free speech rights as citizens. I believe this ruling -- and Big Money in politics – threatens our democracy. To reverse this outrageous judicial overreach, I am an original cosponsor of The People’s Rights Amendment. The bill would amend the Constitution to make it clear that the Constitution protects the rights of real people, not big corporations. It’s time to roll back Citizens United. #CU5	10153008313424812
94324364811	I support the proposal the president outlined tonight in his State of the Union address that would stop special interest giveaways and make the investor class pay its fair share of taxes. We can use that revenue to invest in things like rebuilding our nation’s crumbling infrastructure, which would make our transportation systems more efficient and put hundreds of thousands of Americans back to work. We should also invest in our middle class families by making education affordable, supporting paid sick leave laws, and providing modest tax relief for those working hard but still struggling to make ends meet. However, I remained adamantly opposed to the president’s support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This ill-conceived trade deal would ship even more jobs overseas to the benefit of the biggest corporations in the world. Our nation is strongest when its middle class thrives, and I look forward to supporting policies that make our country great. #SOTU	10153006967839812
94324364811	Minutes ago, the Republican-controlled House passed HR 37, a dream come true for Wall Street. Just six years after a handful of greedy bankers took U.S. taxpayers to the cleaners and started the worst economic downturn in generations, enough Republicans thought it was okay to delay the Volcker rule, which was designed to protect average Americans by prohibiting large banks from risky gambling with taxpayer-backed funds. If rich people want to gamble their own money on Wall Street, that’s their choice, but forcing American taxpayers to bail out banks is just wrong. The president said he’ll veto this bill if it gets to his desk, but either way, House Republicans just sent a strong signal about who – and what – they represent in Congress.	10152993290894812
118845109487	Devastating news. Police Officer Wilson gave his life protecting our city. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and the law enforcement community.	10153664017634488
94324364811	Today we launched a new Facebook page for the Committee that I now lead. Tomorrow is a big day for us-- we'll be debating the controversial Keystone XL pipeline on the House Floor.

94324364811	Thanks to those of you who’ve asked where I stand on today’s announcement concerning Cuba. I support normalizing U.S. relations with Cuba. I believe today’s actions are a common sense approach to restart conversations on issues such as commerce and human rights, and I look forward to moving toward a foreign policy more fitting of the 21st century. #CubaPolicy	10152898875314812
94324364811	Everyone should have access to top-notch health care no matter where they live. Today is National Rural Health Day, and I want to recognize the hospitals, clinics, EMS, physicians, nurses and other health professionals who serve the rural communities of Oregon’s Fourth District. I am proud to fight for continued federal support of rural hospitals and health clinics, which not only provide care to small communities but also offer economic security and quality jobs across America. #powerofrural	10152835312389812
94324364811	You didn’t have to be a car lover to appreciate Tom Magliozzi, better known as one half of Click and Clack on NPR’s “Car Talk.” I contacted their program on more than one occasion to get advice on how to best maintain my '63 Dodge Dart. Naturally, they gave me grief and questioned my judgment in cars. In 2005, I was fortunate enough to actually meet the brothers in person when they came to Capitol Hill and looked under the hood of my '68 Plymouth Barracuda. Tom was a class act through and through, and his quick wit will be sorely missed by adoring fans around the world, including me. RIP, Tom.	10152798170789812
94324364811	My thanks to Corvallis for another great visit. While talking to a crowd about access to natural medicines and supplements at Country Vitamins in Corvallis, the owners of neighboring Cirello’s Pizza invited me to come in for a visit afterward. Then while at Cirello’s, two constituents waved me over to their booth to have a slice of pizza and chat. It’s the people that make me so proud to represent Oregon’s 4th Congressional District.	10152791528874812
94324364811	I joined the picket lines in Springfield today because our country needs more leaders who go to bat for the average American worker. While the parent company of McKenzie-Willamette Medical Center experiences massive revenue growth and pays its CEO $8.6 million in one year, I find it ridiculous that the for-profit hospital wants to force its front line workers – the food service workers, the technicians, the admitting officers – to dig even deeper into their own pockets for their health care coverage, erasing even a modest wage increase. This is hugely symbolic of what’s wrong with corporate America today. I will stand up and fight alongside hard-working Oregonians any day.	10152787444209812
94324364811	During my August town hall tour, many people asked a simple question: “Why doesn’t the U.S. make anything anymore?” It’s an important question. Our manufacturing sector has rapidly declined since its peak about 30 years ago and millions of good-paying, middle class jobs have been shipped overseas. The biggest problem is so-called “free trade deals” pushed by every president in recent history. Despite promises of boosting U.S. exports, NAFTA, TTIP and the pending TPP are merely a race to the bottom for multi-national companies to chase the cheapest labor and the weakest environmental regulations on the planet. This is wrong. Today, I celebrate #NationalManufacturingDay by reaffirming my commitment to fight back against every free trade deal. It’s time to create -- and keep-- U.S. jobs.	10152720637354812
94324364811	My thanks to the U.S. Forest Service for giving me an up-close look at the Deception Creek Complex fire near Oakridge. The good news is that after scorching 6,000 acres, this fire is nearly contained and no longer threatens homes. But it has cost more than $27 million to fight, just one of many wildfires that drains the Forest Service fire prevention budget each year. We need a smarter approach, which is why I’ve cosponsored a bipartisan bill that would treat catastrophic fire as disasters, just like we do with floods and tornadoes. This would stop the cycle of raiding fire prevention funds to fight increasingly costly fires across the West. So far, House Republican leaders have blocked this bill from advancing but I’m going to keep fighting to make this common-sense approach a reality.	10152718381699812
94324364811	In 2008, I introduced a bill requiring pharmaceutical companies and medical device makers to disclose gifts and payments to doctors. I’m happy to report that because of this legislation, we got the first-ever data yesterday, which showed payments of nearly $4 billion in a matter of months. Sometimes there is a legitimate reason for drug companies to pay doctors for their work, but there is a big difference between educating healthcare professionals on the uses and effects of new drugs and devices, versus trying to influence doctors with lavish gifts. Thanks to the Open Payments Program, patients and doctors will get a better idea of what these companies are paying for.\n\nRead more: http://defazio.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/new-data-expose-drug-company-influence-on-doctors	10152715641544812
94324364811	Congratulations to Southwestern Oregon Community College for landing a $2.4 million grant to train students for careers in the health and natural resources industries. This is a big deal for SWOCC and the south coast. These programs will train students for in-demand jobs, help local businesses find skilled employees, and provide important health services to rural communities. I’m proud to support programs that offer real solutions to put Oregonians back to work and strengthen our communities.	10152711421624812
94324364811	Today, my colleagues over in the Senate took up the issue of equal pay for equal work. It’s hard to believe we’re still having this debate. Fifty years after the Equal Pay Act of 1963, women receive just 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Not only does this put a woman and her family at a financial disadvantage with each paycheck, but it also means her retirement gets short-changed over the years. The Paycheck Fairness Act failed several minutes ago in the Senate, but we must keep up the fight. It’s time for Congress to support legislation that makes gender-based discrimination a thing of the past. #PaycheckFairnessAct	10152680676829812
94324364811	Today, a great American program celebrates 20 years. Since 1994, AmeriCorps has allowed more than 900,000 young Americans to serve their country through service by volunteering in schools, health facilities, disaster zones and more. In Oregon alone, 16,000 AmeriCorps members have volunteered more than 20 million hours of service. That’s a lot of good work, and it has helped volunteers develop the skills they need to enter the workforce. I’m proud to support a program that does so much to make our citizens, communities, state and country better. #AmeriCorps20\n\nLearn more about AmeriCorps here: \nhttp://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps	10152673834019812
94324364811	On this Labor Day, I salute America's workers-- the men and women who work day in and day out to make our lives better. From the construction crews that build our homes, roads and bridges, to the fishermen and farmers who provide our food, to the nurses who heal-- our communities are better and our nation is stronger when our middle class is thriving. I will continue fighting for an economy that works for every American, not just the privileged few.	10152647224054812
94324364811	Today I'll be in Myrtle Creek and Roseburg for town halls #11 and #12. Turns out, I'm hosting more town halls this August than any other member of Congress, except for one other congressman from Louisiana. I've had great discussions at each of the towns I've been in over the past week. I look forward to keeping the conversations going!	10152614028319812
94324364811	Happy 79th birthday, Social Security! I’m proud to fight day in and day out to preserve this program on behalf of the millions of Americans who earned their benefits. Social Security has dramatically improved the lives of American seniors, and so I refuse to let Paul Ryan and others take us back to the days when many seniors had no option but to live in abject poverty. Today, more than 40 percent of American seniors would be living below the poverty line if it was not for their Social Security benefits. You earned these benefits and I will continue to do everything I can to make sure that they will be there for you when you need them.\n\nRead more about my plan to keep Social Security financially stable: http://defazio.house.gov/issues/seniors-issues	10152602537964812
94324364811	It’s another jam-packed day for me on the Southern Oregon Coast. This morning, I toured the South Slough Estuary before heading to town hall #7 in North Bend. Over the past few days, I’ve met with small business owners, toured Freeman Marine Equipment in Gold Beach, got a first-hand look at the Bandon Marsh mosquito mitigation project, and met with hundreds of people at town halls up and down the coast. It’s great to be in Oregon.	10152601490589812
94324364811	I'm looking forward to beating the heat tomorrow by heading to the Oregon Coast. I'm kicking off more than two weeks of town halls at the Reedsport City Hall at 10:30 a.m. Over the years, I've gotten great input from citizens at these meetings and I've been able to take those ideas back to Washington, DC. I expect this year will be no different. I hope to see you out there and I hope you are staying cool wherever you are today!\n\nFor my full town hall schedule, click here: \nhttp://defazio.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/defazio-to-host-20-town-hall-meetings	10152594435789812
94324364811	Thank you to everyone who participated in last night’s Telephone Town Hall. I got some great questions on a wide variety of topics, including how we can create jobs by investing in our nation’s infrastructure and what we should be doing to take better care of our veterans. One caller even had a novel idea on how to raise the minimum wage. The conversation isn’t over. I’ll be hosting an additional 19 town halls across Southwest Oregon during the month of August. I’ll post a schedule here on Facebook as soon as the dates and times are finalized. I hope to see you soon and hear what’s on your mind.	10152545922279812
94324364811	Happy birthday, America. On this Fourth of July, I celebrate our country's rich history while remembering why it's so important we fight for its future. We must never let down our guard when it comes to creating good-paying American jobs, guaranteeing civil rights and protecting the environment for our children and grandchildren. And to our veterans and active duty members, thank you for defending this great country. We wouldn't be here without your sacrifice and service.	10152504335519812
94978896695	So proud to meet these smart West Salem High students today. Their project, "Programmable Bio-Scaffolding: The Suture of the Future" won the national title for Grades 10-12 in the ExploraVision Science Fair Competition. Their bright future is Oregon's future.	10153026735071696

94978896695	Happy to speak up today against problematic Country of Origin Labeling requirements that threaten northwest cattlemen and packers. It was a hot DC day, but my House Agriculture Committee colleagues from both sides of the aisle stood with me to #repealCOOL for meat products.	10152983229241696
94978896695	It was an honor to meet Oregon World War II veterans today visiting D.C. on an Honor Flight. I am humbled by their service and sacrifice.	10152975222736696
94978896695	It is with a heavy heart that I write about the loss of Nehalem Mayor Shirley Kalkhoven. Shirley’s dedication to her community stretched far beyond her service as mayor. As a member of countless committees and councils, Shirley devoted extensive time and energy to improving the lives of her neighbors and Oregonians at large. I can think of few who compare to her effusive energy and commitment to service. Her acceptance of the Oregon Mayors Association Mayors Leadership Award last year could not be a more fitting salute to her devotion and passion. I know I am not alone in reeling from this loss and my condolences go out to her family and friends during this time.	10152862111861696
94978896695	It’s that time of year again: The Congressional Art Competition is upon us, and I invite all high school students in the district to apply! We had a great time welcoming last year’s winner, Amy Chen from Lake Oswego High School, to Washington D.C. where she was able to see her painting hung in a corridor of the Capitol. Teachers and students should respond to my office by Friday, March 20th if they would like to participate or visit my website: http://schrader.house.gov/constituent-services/artcompetition.htm	10152860059541696
94978896695	This evening I will host a Town Hall for my constituents in Marion County. If you are in Salem and are able to attend stop by the Salem Library from 6:00-7:00 pm. I hope to see you there!	10152847712796696
94978896695	I was saddened to hear of the passing of Dave Frohnmayer. Dave was a quintessential bipartisan leader more interested in getting results than party politics. My heart goes out to Dave’s family during this difficult time.	10152847617196696
94978896695	On the 50th Anniversary of Selma, we take time to honor and recognize those who marched for civil rights and recommit ourselves to continue that fight.	10152842950556696
94978896695	Thanks to the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association for inviting me to speak yesterday. I enjoyed answering your insightful questions.	10152836316131696
94978896695	Glad to speak to veterinary students today visiting Washington with the American Veterinary Medical Association. I was happy to talk about my career as a veterinarian, my experience serving in Congress and how students and veterinarians can become more engaged with their elected officials to make a difference.	10152832576011696
94978896695	Shutting down the agency charged with protecting our national security is irresponsible. I urge my colleagues to pass a clean bill to keep the Department of Homeland Security open before time runs out.	10152819751151696
94978896695	Yesterday I met with leaders of the Oregon Business Association where we discussed issues important to Oregon's economy. Topics ranged from the dire situation at the Port of Portland, to moving forestry issues forward, and investing in our infrastructure.  It was a lively and important conversation, and I appreciated getting to speak with local business owners.	10152811717186696
94978896695	I spent the better part of the morning touring the U.S. Coast Guard facilities in Newport and meeting with community stakeholders. I was able to see the air facility where the search and rescue helicopter is stationed as well as the Coast Guard base. I am happy with our ability to keep this vital service in place, and I will continue to work for a permanent solution.	10152805971616696
94978896695	Today the House approved HR 431, legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the Foot Soldiers who participated in Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday and the march from Selma to Montgomery in March of 1965. The courage of these individuals who risked everything in the fight for equality in our nation is something that we should all be thankful for. \n\nIn March of 2013, I joined some of my colleagues on Congressman John Lewis’ Faith and Politics Pilgrimage to Alabama. We were able to visit Selma, Birmingham and Montgomery where participants in the African-American civil rights movement conquered their fears in the fight for justice and equality. I was also able to hear the intimate stories about these fearless Americans who rose against the odds to fight the unjust system of segregation. \n\nThis March, during the 50th anniversary of these monumental events, we are able to give thanks to these Americans for their sacrifices that would ultimately lead to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 with the highest civilian honor in the United States. We are able to recognize the heroism and bravery of the civil rights foot soldiers that faced brutal attacks and beatings by state police in their peaceful quest for equality with the Congressional Gold Medal. As a cosponsor of this legislation I was proud to join my fellow House colleagues in unanimous support of HR 431 today and I hope you will join me in the celebration of their sacrifice and courage.	10152794580131696
94978896695	Today I took a tour of the Willamette Falls Locks with members of the local Heritage Area Coalition, my predecessor; former Representative Darlene Hooley, and Colonel Jose Aguilar from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It was great to be able to spend time at this historic location, and I look forward to continued cooperation between each group as we assess the future of the Locks.	10152761623506696
94978896695	I would like to express my gratitude to our rural hospitals and bring to your attention the important role they play in our rural communities. During a climate in Congress that favors budget cuts, we must protect the under served in our rural areas. You can be sure I will continue to support rural hospitals in Congress and oppose efforts that would harm these valuable institutions.	10152614162606696
94978896695	As we continue the fight to keep the Coast Guard Air Facility in Newport, I wanted to share with you the letter I sent with members from the Oregon and South Carolina Congressional delegations to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson yesterday requesting DHS overturn the decision to close the air facilities in Newport and Charleston.	10152610961576696
94978896695	Friends, I wanted to share with you the latest update on our work to keep the USCG flight facility open in Newport:\n\n"Merkley, Wyden and Schrader Persuade Coast Guard to Delay Newport Helicopter Closure\n \nPortland, OR – Oregon Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden and Congressman Kurt Schrader today spoke with the Commandant of the Coast Guard and got assurance from him that the November 30th date previously set for the closure of the Newport helicopter facility would be extended to December 15th. The Coast Guard agreed that this additional time would allow for a more extensive and thorough discussion of the risks to recreational fishing, commercial fishing and other activities on the Central Coast of Oregon. During today’s call the Oregon delegation members declared their intent to use every possible advocacy path to keep the helicopter in Newport, conveying to the Coast Guard that the safety of thousands is at stake. \n  \nThis comes after Senator Merkley, Congressman Schrader and Congresswoman Bonamici held a press conference earlier today with members of the Newport Fishermen’s Wives, commercial fishermen and coastal first responders in calling on the U.S. Coast Guard to reverse the decision to close the Newport helicopter facility. The three lawmakers have joined with Senator Wyden, Congressman Peter DeFazio and Congressman Earl Blumenauer since the Coast Guard made its closure announcement earlier this month to strongly urge the decision be reversed and to delay the closure to provide more time to seek a long-term solution."	10152574112216696
94978896695	I was lucky enough to stop by two schools in Salem today. The 8th graders at Waldo Middle School and the students at McKay High School had a lot of great questions that I had fun answering. One of the best parts of my job is having the chance to meet with young people all over the district to hear about how they see the world and what their dreams for the future are. Thank you to both schools for allowing me to visit today!	10152564627906696
94978896695	Today I joined my colleagues in calling for a delay in the decision to close the coast guard air station in Newport.	10152563426966696
94978896695	I was honored to welcome my colleague, Congressman Xavier Becerra to Oregon for a day of discussions with community members and stake holders about the outlook of immigration reform.  Discussions like these are incredibly important as we continue to push for legislation in Congress. Congressman Becerra is a leader on this issue, and I appreciate the time he took to hear from the Oregonians today.	10152554621236696
94978896695	I was pleased to stop by the regular meeting for the executive board of the Northwest Oregon Labor Council today. These meetings give me a chance to check in with local community leaders and hear directly about issues that they are facing. I was also able to congratulate Labors Community Services on their 40th anniversary! LCS serves thousands of Oregonians through several programs including dislocated worker services.	10152502513081696
118845109487	It was a pleasure to introduce my friend, Congressman John Lewis, at the Congressional Summer Intern Lecture Series. \nCongressman Lewis talked about his distinguished service both as a Member of Congress and as a civil rights leader.

118845109487	Happy Thanksgiving! I am grateful for many things this year, especially my family and the amazing 1st District of Pennsylvania. However, on this day of warmth and good food, remember to take a moment to think of those less fortunate.	10153372497984488
118845109487	Today’s brutal terrorist attack in Jerusalem, the murder of worshipers at morning prayer in a synagogue, is beyond comprehension.  This barbaric act, which is being celebrated by Hamas and other terrorists, demonstrates the need for continued resolute support for the people of Israel. My heart aches for the victims of this attack and their loved ones. I send my deepest condolences and will keep Israel in my thoughts and prayers during the dark time of mourning.	10153354749774488
118845109487	Today marks the start of the second Affordable Care Act enrollment period. Since last year, many updates have taken place, increasing the accessibility of affordable health care options for many different types of budgets.

118845109487	Moments ago, I introduced a bill on the floor of Congress that would expand federal hate crime laws to protect LGBT individuals in all situations, no matter where the crime occurs. No one should be afraid to walk the streets of Philadelphia, or any other place in America, because of who they are or who they love.	10153344757369488
118845109487	Today, let us take a moment to reflect on all of the brave men and women who risked their lives to protect our country. Thank you for your service and sacrifice – it is because of you that our country remains safe.	10153335651289488
118845109487	L'Shana Tova U'metukah to all of those in Philadelphia and around the world celebrating Rosh Hashanah this week! My family and I wish everyone a happy, healthy, and sweet 5775.	10153202290849488

118845109487	On this anniversary of 9/11, let us never forget those that we lost on this tragic day 13 years ago. Let us also keep the families who lost loved ones and those still suffering in our thoughts today.	10153168639544488
118845109487	I am extremely concerned and saddened with the current situation in Ferguson, MO following the death of Michael Brown. American citizens should not have to fear for their safety as they walk down the street because of their religion, national origin, or race. I call for an immediate demilitarization of the situation and thorough investigation into the end of this young man’s life.	10153089243434488
118845109487	49 years ago today President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law.  Today, these essential programs provide coverage to nearly 117 million elderly, disabled, and low-income Americans – including more than 26 million children –health insurance that would otherwise be out of reach.	10153047919734488
118845109487	Happy Fourth of July to everyone in the 1st District of Pennsylvania!	10152982209699488
118845109487	My heart is broken for the three Israeli teenage boys found in the West Bank yesterday. My sincerest condolences to the Israeli people and the three teens' families.	10152973312444488
118845109487	I am disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decisions today to deny women THEIR reproductive rights and weaken public unions.  These decisions will hurt women and hurt the middle class.	10152971848389488
118845109487	Wishing each and every father in the 1st District of Pennsylvania a wonderful Father’s Day. My father shaped me into the person I am today and for that I am forever grateful. My own children make me proud of them each and every day. #FathersDay	10152920523464488
118845109487	Excited by today's news that U.S. District Judge John E. Jones, III has found Pennsylvania's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. I support equal rights for all my constituents and look forward to Pennsylvania joining other states in having marriage equality.	10152861036819488
118845109487	Wishing #Israel a happy 66th Independence Day! The United States has enjoyed a steadfast bond with the Jewish State for the last 66 years and looks forward to many more years of cooperation and friendship.	10152823102039488
118845109487	In 2014, it is disgraceful that women still make 77 cents for every dollar men make. #EqualPayDay marks the extra time it would take a woman – almost exactly a year and three months – to make in wages what a man would make in just one year. On this #EqualPayDay, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to pass legislation that ensures #equalpay for #equalwork. Because when women succeed, America succeeds.	10152750349089488
118845109487	Yesterday I joined 155 of my colleagues in signing Representative Tim Bishop’s discharge petition to raise the minimum wage because it is inexcusable that many Americans making minimum wage cannot afford to feed their own families. Raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 would pull millions out of poverty. It is vitally important that we help those who need it most in our community and that’s why I will continue to fight to give Americans a raise.	10152654424954488
118845109487	Five years ago today, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law. I remain proud of my vote for this bill, ensuring women have the right to fight for equal pay in court, because when women succeed, we all succeed.	10152581956804488
118845109487	Looking forward to 8 pm - Let's go Eagles!	10152522889489488
165961823475034	Earlier this week I joined SEPTA and members of the community to open the newly renovated 23rd & Venango Bus Loop. Not only does this project stand to improve accessibility and safety for all residents of the community, the updated transit hub is integral to the overall revitalization of the Allegheny West neighborhood.\n\nI am pleased to have helped secure the federal funding that made this improvement project possible, and #SEPTA deserves immense credit for their sustained commitment to advancing our region’s transit infrastructure.	896492163755326

165961823475034	I am proud to share that the School District of Philadelphia has received $29.1 Million in new #GEARUP funding.

165961823475034	I had the opportunity to speak with 200+ college-bound students at yesterday's annual CORE Scholars Summer Sendoff Celebration. \n\nSince working with several community partners to create CORE 10 years ago, the program has provided $32 million in scholarships to more than 26,000 Philadelphia-area students.

165961823475034	Yesterday I joined HUD, Mayor Nutter, Senator Casey, and Council President Darrell Clarke to announce a $30 million grant that will revitalize and transform North Central Philadelphia.  With this funding, thousands of Philadelphians stand to benefit from a revitalized economic district, expanded educational and job training opportunities, and new affordable housing.\n\nI am proud to see the North Central Philadelphia community — and its dedicated partners — recognized for their vision of a brighter future for this neighborhood. I have been an advocate of this program in Congress and I am proud to see these funds come home. Read more: http://bit.ly/TzxlSV	692003410870870

They were visiting Washington with "It Takes Philly," a local organization committed to exposing young people to opportunities and professions outside their immediate communities. I spoke to them about my work in Congress and the importance of staying focused on their studies. I know these students have a bright future ahead.	621823737888838
165961823475034	It was an honor to join Vice President Biden and Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx in Philadelphia today to help unveil Amtrak’s new Cities Sprinter train and advocate for the modernization of our country’s transit and infrastructure—especially passenger rail. Rail has no greater champion than Vice President Biden, and I commend our Administration’s efforts to make investing in high-speed rail a national priority. \n\nIt was an exciting day for #Amtrak, for the Northeast Corridor, and for #Philadelphia. Our city not only boasts Amtrak’s third busiest train station, but was also responsible for manufacturing the steel handrails and tie-rods that adorn the new locomotives...\n\nRead the rest of my statement here: http://1.usa.gov/LUv7dx	608846199186592

165961823475034	“America is better and stronger when it upholds the fundamental promise on which it was built: that all are created equal.  Today’s Supreme Court rulings striking down the Defense of Marriage Act and rendering Proposition 8 unconstitutional, brings members of the LGBT community closer to realizing the fulfillment of that promise.  Millions of Americans will now be able to fully enjoy the freedom to love and marry the person of their choice.  Families will be strengthened because children of same-sex couples will now be able to enjoy the same privileges and benefits that children of hetero-sexual couples enjoy. \n\n“But, for the tens of thousands of couples who live in States where their marriages are not recognized, there is still work to do.  We must continue to push for equality for all people and ensure that we protect the values inherent in the American way of life.”	500023746735505
165961823475034	Today the Supreme Court did the right thing...on a 5-4 vote it struck down the Defense of Marriage Act citing it violates due process and equal protection.	499855703418976
165961823475034	“The Supreme Court’s decision represents the ruling of our nation’s highest judicial authority and the law of the land.  For the record, I join with those who strongly disagree with today’s ruling. Although we must adhere to the Court’s decision, the justices have made it perfectly clear that Congress has a significant role to play in updating and protecting the provisions of this important legislation.  Absent the Voting Rights Act, the America we enjoy today would be non-existent.  I will work with my colleagues to ensure that we update the Voting Rights Act and fully protect the right to vote.”	499546900116523

165961823475034	April’s unemployment number restores confidence that the job market is improving. The private sector added 165,000 jobs, marking the 38th month of consecutive growth. Revised numbers from February and March showing 332,000 jobs were added causes the unemployment rate to dip down to 7.5 percent – the lowest in four years. That spells good news for our economy.\nThe numbers are a continuous reminder that under President Obama’s leadership, the economy is gradually getting stronger but, there is still work to do.  I again call on my colleagues to put partisan politics aside and let’s work together so that every able bodied American who wants a job has a job.	477155702355643
165961823475034	The President couldn't have made a better choice than Representative Mel Watt as the new Federal Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  His years as a small business owner, lawyer, state legislator and Member of the U.S. House of Representatives lay tribute to his dedication and commitment to the consumer. A champion of the poor, Mel has been keenly focused on expanding economic opportunities for all Americans. For decades he has worked to shield homeowners from predatory lenders and hold responsible those finance companies who deal in deceptive and discriminatory practices.  Mel Watt, I'm proud to call him my colleague and my friend.	476429322428281

376801102416184	Yesterday, I opposed the USA Freedom Act because it didn't stop the #NSA's mass collection of Americans’ data.

376801102416184	Federal regulations cost small businesses about $11,000 per employee. 4th District small businesses have told me this hurts local job creation. The House acted today to require federal agencies to disclose the full economic costs of federal mandates on states, local governments, and small businesses.  It also requires federal agencies to consult with private-sector employers that will be impacted by any new regulations. This is a common-sense solution to improve transparency and hold the government accountable to the American people.	769232823173008
376801102416184	Contrary to what you’ve read in the media, the House has only voted to repeal the ACA four times. We’ve voted on 56 changes and President Obama has signed 10 of them into law. Glad we can agree that the ACA is very flawed. The House will introduce legislation in the future focused upon patient centered healthcare reform.	768600943236196

14463006747	My statement following passage of H.R. 33, legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security through March 6, 2015. \n\n“It is our Constitutional duty to ensure that our country remains safe and today’s vote will adequately fund agencies under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security. Plus, there are no funds in the bill to support the President’s unilateral actions on immigration. \n\nWhen the Executive and Legislative Branches of our government are in disagreement, the Judicial Branch must play referee, and that is exactly what took place when a federal judge sided with a complaint filed by 26 states in opposition of the President’s moves towards amnesty.”	10152828591611748
14463006747	My statement regarding the President's decision to veto the construction of the Keystone Pipeline:  \n\n“Despite bipartisan support from both the House and Senate, the President has vetoed the Keystone XL Pipeline Project in the name of political expediency. Rather than carry out the will of the American people, this veto kowtows to a vocal minority of extreme environmental groups. The President’s veto is a giant leap backwards on our road to energy independence, effectively saying ‘no’ to the creation of over 40,000 American jobs and lower energy prices for businesses and families.”	10152821726781748
14463006747	Honored to be recognized by local workforce investment boards for my support in helping pass the Workforce Innovation & Opportunity Act of 2014.\n\nThis law has helped put Americans back to work by reforming the nation’s outdated workforce development system.\n\nThe Centre Daily Times has the story: http://bit.ly/1CIQ54E	10152804023096748

136000283132824	The IRS data breach announced yesterday is another example of the sophisticated and growing capacities of cyber criminals. Tax returns – with all the personal data they contain – are a tempting target for thieves. Online services designed for convenience and ease of use by the consumer may well be exploited by hackers. With millions of Americans’ identities at risk, intrusions are unacceptable.\n\nI will be working closely with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Ryan, Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Peter Roskam and my colleagues on the committee to get answers for those affected.	866495436749968
136000283132824	On the House floor now: Bill making permanent the Research & Development tax credit. Good for manufacturing, innovation in PA. Pennsylvania businesses spend almost $10 billion on R&D every year. The tax credit means middle-class research jobs in manufacturing, tech, & the life sciences.	862765050456340
136000283132824	Included in a bipartisan human trafficking bill passed by the House earlier today: a provision I championed with my colleague Rep.

136000283132824	The House just overwhelmingly passed an important bipartisan bill giving Congress the opportunity to formally review any potential deal with #Iran. The Senate passed the bill 98-1 last week, and it now goes to the President for his signature. Iran must not be permitted to develop nuclear weapons, and this bill will give Congress a chance to put a stop to a bad deal.	860437104022468
136000283132824	My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the six passengers who lost their lives in the derailment of the Amtrak train. They also go out the scores of injured, some who remain in critical condition.\n\nIt is a fitting moment to praise the first responders, firefighters and police who have handled the tragedy so effectively. Partnering with our hospitals and their staffs, they jointly prepare for crisis response and their professionalism in this moment of challenge is a positive reflection.\n\nAs a former member of the Rail Subcommittee on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I will work with my colleagues to assure we get a complete understanding of the cause of this tragedy.	859893570743488

136000283132824	America's currency is rich in tradition and symbolism and has always featured important American leaders. We want our currency to reflect who we are as a nation and as a people and we want it to honor great Americans. But for more than a century, our paper currency has failed to showcase any of the women that have played so vital a role in making America the nation it is today. More and more Americans have come to realize that the contributions of women deserve this tribute on our currency.\n \nThat's why, today, I'm urging the Secretary of the Treasury to commission a panel to study this issue and select a woman worthy of the tribute of a portrait on our money. It's time to break the green ceiling and honor a woman on our $20 bill.	843994975666681

136000283132824	The Senate’s vote to override the President’s veto of the Keystone XL pipeline just failed.

Bob Casey.	820985374634308
136000283132824	Looking forward to hearing from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netahyahu before Congress tomorrow. A nuclear Iran is an existential threat to Israel and I share his concerns about a prospective deal. Congress will benefit from hearing his views in this debate.	820040721395440
136000283132824	I cosponsored a bill this week that will expand access to new electronic learning technologies for children by reducing their import tariffs and treating them like toys, books and computers. Lowering duties on these products will make them more affordable for families and school districts.	818877731511739
136000283132824	What a mistake. The Keystone Pipeline is supported by members of both parties. The State Department said it would not impact the climate. It will make filling up at the pump cheaper. It will create thousands of American jobs. President Obama had an opportunity to show that he means what he says when he says he is willing to reach across the aisle and work with both Republicans and Democrats. It's a missed opportunity, and a disappointment.	817108658355313

132077153521454	From the "Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone XL Project" provided by United States Department of State - Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs:\n\n"During construction, proposed Project spending would support approximately 42,100 jobs (direct, indirect, and induced), and approximately $2 billion in earnings throughout the United States. Of these jobs, approximately 3,900 would be direct construction jobs in the proposed Project area in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas (3,900 over 1 year of construction, or 1,950 per year if construction took 2 years). \n\nConstruction of the proposed Project would contribute approximately $3.4 billion (or 0.02 percent) to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). The proposed Project would generate approximately 50 jobs during operations. Property tax revenue during operations would be substantial for many counties, with an increase of 10 percent or more in 17 of the 27 counties with proposed Project facilities.\n\nThe jobs and earnings analysis recognizes three distinct components of economic activity and job creation: direct, indirect, and induced.\n\n• Direct economic activity associated with construction includes all jobs and earnings at firms that are awarded contracts for goods and services, including construction, directly by Keystone.\n\n• Indirect economic activity includes all goods and services purchased by these construction contractors in the conduct of their services to the proposed Project. Examples of these types of activities related to pipeline construction include the goods and services purchased to produce inputs such as concrete, fuel, surveying, welding materials, and earth-moving equipment.\n\n• Induced economic activity includes the spending of earnings received by employees working for either the construction contractor or for any supplier of goods and services required in the construction process. Examples of induced activities include Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement Executive Summary Keystone XL Project ES-20 spending by access road construction crews, welders, employees of pipe manufacturers, and ranchers providing beef for restaurants and construction camps."	812210265508136

132077153521454	“I oppose across the board or blanket amnesty. Any immigration reform must begin with securing the border.  To that end, I joined the House in August in passing legislation to do just that. \n\nThe President should not be going it alone - he should bring Americans together to solve this problem instead of dividing Americans even further. The president’s unilateral and unconstitutional immigration executive orders dissolve trust in our elected government, and they hurt those playing by the rules and trying to earn their citizenship the right way.\n\nEarlier this year, I visited the southern border and saw firsthand the legal and humanitarian crisis caused by an administration refusing to execute the laws of our immigration system. The president’s unlawful orders will drastically increase this problem.\n\nAs we learn the full scope of the president’s actions, I expect Congress to address this in a fashion that is reasoned and responsible.  People want a solution to our immigration challenges that is bipartisan, permanent and legal.”	772139592848537

I am also grateful and appreciative to those first responders and Good Samaritans who helped the injured.

177551525610164	I joined my colleagues for the Congressional Woman’s Softball Game. We brought home the Win & raised $150K to #beatcancer	776741489024495
54386677806	Tonight with my support the House passed a resolution officially forming a select committee to investigate the Benghazi attacks. For two years the Obama Administration has been putting up hurdles and making excuses, but enough is enough. We owe it to the victims and the American people to finally discover the truth.	10152119673452807
54386677806	Congress needs to be looking at the long-term fiscal consequences of the bills it passes, not just the immediate impact. That's why I was pleased to vote today for H.R. 1874, the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act, which requires the CBO to analyze the long-term economic effects of any legislation that has a significant impact on our GDP.	10152050618442807
54386677806	I'll be on Fox News today at 2:00pm with Gretchen Carlson to discuss the most recent Obamacare delay and my fight to repeal this disastrous health care law. Be sure to tune in!	10152043849127807
54386677806	If President Obama thinks he can bury America's coal industry in a wave of new regulations, he is mistaken. That's why today I voted for H.R. 2824, the Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America Act. This bill eases the strain of unnecessary regulations so that our coal energy producers can remain competitive and continue providing jobs here in Pennsylvania.	10152032546877807
54386677806	It was 4 years ago today that Obamacare was signed into law. In the time since, we've seen millions lose their preferred health coverage, countless businesses struggle with a wave of new regulations, and a whole array of website glitches, crashes, and errors. From my own NO IRS bill which defunds Obamacare to my letter calling for Kathleen Sebelius to resign, I have fought hard to repeal this train wreck of a law. On today's anniversary, you can rest assured that I will continue that fight until Obamacare is gone for good.	10152028810097807
54386677806	Since the day he took office, President Obama has been trying to push his agenda through by any means possible, including ignoring laws that we already have. The president can't simply disregard laws he doesn't like, which is why today I voted for H.R. 3973, the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014. Building on yesterday's bill, H.R. 3973 requires any federal official who stops enforcing a law give a full report to Congress explaining the reason why.	10152010847097807
54386677806	As we've already seen with Keystone XL, red tape and too much bureaucracy can slow down important energy and infrastructure projects. That's why today, with my support, the House passed H.R. 2641, the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development (RAPID) Act. This bill makes important changes to the federal permitting process, including limiting the time an agency can stall a project through environmental assessments, to get these shovel-ready projects started faster.	10151996810322807
54386677806	With all the glitches and delays of Obamacare, it's ridiculous that anyone should still be given a penalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate. That's why today I voted for H.R. 4118, the Suspending the Individual Mandate Penalty Law Equals Fairness Act, which delays the individual mandate penalty so that you won't be punished for your personal health care decisions.	10151994830992807
54386677806	We must continue to fight back against the crushing regulations that threaten to cripple the competitiveness of American business. That's why yesterday I voted in favor of H.R. 2804, the All Economic Regulations Are Transparent (ALERT) Act. This bill requires that federal agencies give regular and public reports about the cost of new regulations so that their impact can evaluated before they go into effect, not after.	10151984592052807
54386677806	Across the 9th District, over 9,000 homes directly rely on propane for home heating, but this winter's extreme cold has resulted in such a high level of demand that it threatens to outpace supply. While the Department of Transportation has allowed tank trucks carrying propane to drive for longer hours, this is only a temporary measure. That's why I am introducing the Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through Transportation (HHEATT) Act, to guarantee an extension of these longer driving hours through May 31st and speed crucial supplies of propane straight to the homes and businesses that need them the most.	10151980317337807
54386677806	Happy President's day, everyone! George Washington once famously said, "The Constitution is the guide which I never will abandon." His words still hold true today, and serve as a reminder of our duty to defend that sacred document.	10151965539752807
54386677806	Obama's State of the Union speech was more of the same from a president whose failed policies have resulted in high unemployment, a loss of American jobs, and a massive debt.  Obama simply doubled down on his plan to keep increasing the size of government through executive action. He is wrong if he thinks he can circumvent Congress and write the laws himself. Regardless of his rhetoric tonight, I will continue the fight to not only protect our Congressional authority but to protect my constituents from more burdensome regulations.	10151928108772807
54386677806	Today with my support the House passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. This bill, which I cosponsored, prohibits the use of any federal funds for abortion and brings an end to abortion coverage in Obamacare. We need a single, comprehensive law to ensure that taxpayers are not forced to violate their rights of conscience, and this bill protects you from being forced to pay for these procedures.	10151927599222807
54386677806	If you're coming to D.C. from Pennsylvania for the March for Life today, be sure to stop by room 345 in the Cannon House Office Building from 1:00pm-3:30pm to warm up with some coffee, juice and snacks.	10151915601107807
54386677806	Had a great time touring the Johnson Matthey facility in Smithfield yesterday. I'm proud to see that such cutting edge work in the area of specialty chemicals is taking place right here in the 9th District.	10151906712487807
54386677806	Here's wishing everyone a happy, safe, and successful New Year! As we enter 2014, what issues would you like to see Congress address this session?	10151872873862807
54386677806	Tomorrow, HHS Secretary Sebelius is testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, but nothing she says can change the fact that Obamacare is a disaster. With so many of you sharing stories of cancelled plans, hiked premiums and website crashes, what would you want her to know? #AskSebelius	10151833766617807
54386677806	Today's jobs numbers are just another sign that the economy performs best without government "stimulus" or "bailouts." To truly achieve reliable growth, however, President Obama and his Senate Democrats need to act now and pass the dozens of House-passed jobs bills that are piling up on their desks.	10151825106347807

There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass." - Isoroku Yamamoto, the Japanese military commander understood the armed American citizenry posed a significant roadblock to their discussions regarding the invasion of American soil.

144408762280226	Wrapping up a busy week at the Capitol. Enjoyed talking with 6th graders from Mountain View Elementary School (despite the rain), hosted the 4th Annual Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth's Shadow Day with my good friend Congressmember Karen Bass and went on the One America News Network to discuss ways to undermine Russian meddling around the world and defeat ISIS.	824173757637053
144408762280226	Great to have such wonderful and inquisitive students from South Williamsport High School come visit me at the Capitol today. They sure had some tough questions for me but it is their interest and willingness to ask hard questions that gives me faith in our future generations. These young folks were a joy to be around and I hope they will come back for a visit.	821476247906804

Had the absolute pleasure of talking with about 200 5th and 6th graders at at Lycoming Valley Intermediate School then went to lunch hosted by Commissioner Tony Mussare, Rainbow Cleaners and the NFIB. I got great questions from the kids and had productive conversations at the NFIB event. Here are some pictures from my travels:	817963678258061
144408762280226	FEMA just announced the recipients of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG).

144408762280226	I was honored today to speak with 10th grade civic and history students today at Williamsport Area High School.  I was also pleased to present Mr. Tom Rinker and his students a U.S. flag that was flown over the capitol.  I always enjoy engaging with students and answering their well thought out questions about government and politics.	814950598559369

144408762280226	Today I voted YES on a series of tough IRS and tax reform bills. These were not symbolic votes on Tax Day, they are serious-minded proposals designed to make the system less bureaucratic and more business friendly. \n\nMy YES votes: HR 1058, Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act; H.R. 709, Prevent Targeting at the IRS Act; H.R. 1026, Taxpayer Knowledge of IRS Investigations Act (congrats Representative Mike Kelly) H.R. 1314, Ensuring Tax Exempt Organizations the Right to Appeal Act (congrats Pat Congressman Patrick Meehan), H.R. 1152, IRS Email Transparency Act; H.R. 1295, IRS Bureaucracy Reduction and Judicial Review Act; H.R. 1104, Fair Treatment For All Gifts Act.	808613535859742

144408762280226	Yesterday I visited with regional community bankers and hosted a coffee meeting with some local constituents at our Williamsport office. We discussed a number of issues from the negative impacts of Dodd-Frank to my role on the House Committee on Homeland Security.	802404049814024
144408762280226	Today I was proud to reintroduce 2 important bills: term limits and single subject bill proposals. I also joined a colleague in another endeavor I started in my first term: allow bills passed out of committees to the floor for a vote. These bills are the trifecta that will revolutionize Congress.

144408762280226	I am so proud of Boy Scout Troop 5 from Pike County! They made a long journey to deliver the 'Lincoln flag' to Ford's Theater. I wasn't able to meet them here in DC but my own Eagle Scout, Jeff presented them with a flag flown over the Capitol and a congressional commendation. I hope to see them back in Pike County when the flag returns.	787326481321781
144408762280226	Today I voted YES on H.R. 529 "to improve and expand education opportunity by strengthening 529 college savings accounts." I didn't attend college until I was passed up for a promotion in my young adult life. I knew then how important education was to prosperity and advancement. That is why I support 529 savings plans with this legislation so we can modernize this mechanism and give our young people more opportunity to succeed. http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/233845-house-passes-bill-to-expand-college-savings-plans	785693248151771
144408762280226	Well, President Obama just vetoed the #KeystoneXL project despite the fact that it passed both chambers with wide bipartisan support. After 2,349 days of inaction, you might might wonder what could be accomplished in that amount of time.

144408762280226	Today I voted YES on H.R. 636,  the America’s Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015. This is an important bill for so many folks in PA-10 because it will permanently allow businesses to claim up to$500,000 via what is know as the Section 179 clause in the federal tax code. I will always support the simplification of the tax code and we are working on that - for now, this gives greater certainty to business owners who drive our economy and create jobs.	779478592106570

144408762280226	Today I voted YES on H.R. 615 - the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act. This is another bill, out of the House Committee on Homeland Security, designed to protect Americans and increase the communications effectiveness at DHS. The House passed this last year but it sat on Reid's desk. So, we passed it again today. I also voted YES on H.R. 361 - Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act and H.R. 623 - Social Media Working Group Act of 2015.	773310152723414

192357174108435	Today marks the third anniversary of President Obama's unlawful action that grants amnesty to illegal immigrants, otherwise known as DACA.  It stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and it is simply amnesty by another name.  DACA abuses the practice of prosecutorial discretion by halting the deportation of illegal immigrants and granting them work permits if they claim to have arrived in the U.S. before age 16 and have been present for five years, among other criteria.  I have fought it at every turn, and continue to oppose it.	1014843608526450
192357174108435	It was great to be with so many patriots on Flag Day at Kirby Park in Kingston on Sunday. We used the occasion to thank our military veterans, who have always defended our freedoms around the globe, and also our first responders, who protect our neighborhoods here at home.	1014716778539133
192357174108435	As I am recuperating from surgery, I was unable to be present for this vote, but I would have voted today in favor of H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.  The bill prohibits the abortion of unborn children after five months – the point at which science has determined that they can feel pain.  I was proud to cosponsor this legislation.    \n\nAs a father and grandfather, and someone who wholeheartedly believes in the sanctity and dignity of life, I strongly support this legislation.  We are talking about babies who are far enough along in their development that many parents are already deciding on names.  Science tells us that at five months, the babies feel pain.  This legislation is justified and necessary in a moral and civil society.    \n\nI also note that the passage of this legislation appropriately comes during the week that marks the two-year anniversary of the conviction of former Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell.   He was found guilty of dozens of late-term abortion-related crimes, including infanticide and the involuntary manslaughter of a patient.  The horrors inflicted on the innocent should never be forgotten.\n\nH.R. 36 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 242-to-184, with one member voting present.	998016326875845
192357174108435	I wanted to let you know that yesterday I underwent a successful cardiac catheterization at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in order to clear a blocked artery near my heart.  My doctors expect a full recovery and say I can return to my normal work schedule next week.  They’ve given me a clean bill of health and say my heart is better than ever.\n\nI had experienced some shortness of breath in recent days, which prompted me to seek a checkup.  Doctors discovered a blocked artery which required a stent to repair it.\n\nI am very grateful to the medical team at the University of Pennsylvania and thank them for their excellent care.  I also thank my doctors in Hazleton, and also the medical staff at the Capitol in Washington.  I hope this serves as a reminder to everyone to pay attention to warning signs and have regular medical checkups.\n\nHope to see you soon!	997371746940303

192357174108435	This morning, I attended the 3rd Annual Pennsylvania Firefighters breakfast.  Our nation's firefighters are vital to our local communities, and I am doing everything I can to protect them.  Earlier this year, the House unanimously passed - for the third time - my bill to ensure that emergency services volunteers are not counted as full-time employees by the IRS under the Employer Mandate of Obamacare.  If volunteer fire companies were subject to the mandates of Obamacare, they could be liable for crippling new health care costs, causing many to have to close their doors.	984526371558174

192357174108435	Our community should be very proud of Nanticoke Boy Scout Jared Marshallick and his father Frank. They were handing out flyers for the Boy Scouts last month when they noticed a building on fire. They acted quickly and helped a family escape to safety.  And here's the rest of the Boy Scouts from Troop 418 in Nanticoke.	964373580240120
192357174108435	In Nanticoke, I'm again rallying support for my bill to protect volunteer firefighters from Obamacare. 97 percent of Pennsylvania fire companies rely on volunteers. If they fell under the Employer Mandate of Obamacare, many would have to close their doors because of the costs.	963899710287507
192357174108435	I had the rare and distinct honor today of meeting with retired Colonel Ted Halliday and presenting him with a certificate for his service during World War II.  Col. Halliday is part of a generation that made America great.  We owe him and his compatriots a debt of gratitude that can never truly be repaid.	953454434665368

192357174108435	I have waited for a long time for there to be a fair hearing of bills that pass the House of Representatives.  To this point, the previous Senate had blocked everything without even considering the merits of the legislation.  Now that we have a Senate that will actually consider House bills, rather than kill them out-of-hand, I think it is a new day in Congress.\n\nFor that reason, I am supporting John Boehner for Speaker.  I believe he deserves the chance to negotiate with a Senate which, for once, is not an automatic adversary.	929462810397864
192357174108435	Tonight I voted in favor of the so-called “Cromnibus” funding bill, which is a combination of a Continuing Resolution funding the Department of Homeland Security through February 27, 2015 and an omnibus spending package funding the rest of the federal government through September 30, 2015.\n\nWhile the overall discussion of the Cromnibus spending bill deals with the operation of the entire federal budget, for me the most important factor is illegal immigration and the question of stopping President Obama’s executive amnesty.   We have immigration laws in this country for two reasons: to protect national security and preserve American jobs.  The president’s actions violate both of those principles.  He is introducing five million more competitors into an already tight job market, at a time when 20 million Americans are either unemployed or underemployed.  It is time that someone stood up for legal American workers.  Therefore, the most important question I must answer for myself is: how best to stop the president’s unlawful executive action?\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have determined that it is a much better strategy to have the fight over funding the amnesty program once our reinforcements have arrived in the form of the new Senate to be sworn in early next year.  I did not come to this decision lightly, but it is obvious to me that there is no language that I would support regarding illegal immigration that would stand a chance of passing the Senate while Harry Reid is still in charge.  Understanding that truth, I cast my vote in favor of the Cromnibus with the full knowledge that we will attack the issue again early in 2015.\n\nThere can be no one who questions my position on illegal immigration.  During lengthy discussions and negotiations leading up to the vote, I was personally assured by Speaker Boehner that I will play an integral role in crafting new, strong national immigration policies beginning in January.  I came to Congress to strengthen our enforcement of immigration laws, and now I will have the ability to influence the direction and impact of our immigration policies as we work to block the president’s amnesty.	912514798759332
192357174108435	I was pleased to vote for passage of the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act, which amends the Internal Revenue Service code to establish tax-exempt accounts for individuals with disabilities to assist in paying for certain expenses, including higher education, primary residence, transportation, employment assistance, health and wellness, and other personal support expenses.  The ABLE Act is a huge step forward for people with disabilities and their families.  So many times, families have been left in the difficult position of choosing between taking care of children’s special needs and planning for their future.  The ABLE Act helps families avoid that predicament and lets them plan ahead.  As it stands now, people living with disabilities are unable to accumulate more than $2,000 in assets without endangering their Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid benefits.

192357174108435	It was 73 years ago today, on a date which has indeed lived in infamy, that Japanese forces attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, finally drawing the United States into World War II. Over 2,400 Americans were killed as a result of the assault, with nearly 1,200 more wounded.  If you visit the site today, you can see that oil still leaks from the U.S.S. Arizona all these decades later.  \n\nNine survivors of the massive explosion aboard the Arizona are still with us today, and they serve as a living reminder that the United States remains defended by brave men and women who fight for the freedoms and blessings we enjoy today.	910241492319996

At Rockefeller Center in New York City, an 85-foot Norway Spruce, formerly found at the home of Dan and Rachel Sigafoos of Columbia County, will be delighting millions of admirers.  Meanwhile, an 18-and-a-half-foot Douglas Fir from Crystal Spring Tree Farm in Lehighton will be gracing the White House.  Making Pennsylvania proud!	907656505911828
192357174108435	What a pleasure to meet with NFL legend Marshall Faulk on Capitol Hill this afternoon.  He was in town representing SAP, a world-class technology company with its North American headquarters in Pennsylvania.  In that first picture, Marshall's giving me advice on how to fix my fantasy football team headed down the stretch.  He reminded me that, unfortunately, he's retired and I can't pick him up for my team.	900793923264753
192357174108435	Earlier this afternoon I was released from Penn State Hershey Medical Center, where the wonderful doctors, nurses, and staff took great care of me.  I had gone in on Monday for a scheduled test, and the doctors advised me to have some plaque removed from my right carotid artery.  I’m feeling good and ready to continue to serve the people of Pennsylvania’s 11th District.  My wife, Mary Grace, our four daughters, and I are very grateful for the strong support and well wishes we received from so many people over the last couple of days.  It really means a lot to our family, and reminds us that we are truly blessed.  May God bless you all.	893729977304481
133803223451004	Hundreds of people in Western Pennsylvania contacted me to voice their concern over TPA. Based on the calls I've received, for every 1 call in support, 34 residents opposed TPA. In light of this, and given my concerns with the lack of clarity in our trade objectives and the lack of transparency, I did not believe oversight provisions were adequate. The bill today simply didn't provide the tools Congress needs to deliver a deal that meets the expectations of the American people.	474000082764648

133803223451004	Students not yet old enough to serve their country, with great care and a lot of loving labor, carved out a little piece of history where the stories of those who sacrificed can be remembered and shared. I was honored to attend the grand opening of their Veterans Memorial in Derry this evening, and congratulate them for completing a project of such proportion.\n\nFor centuries, monuments have been built for the purpose of creating a timeless place, where the memories of those we've lost can live on for future generations. This sentiment is beautifully embodied in the students' design of this memorial. For years to come, visitors can look up to the American flag at the center, and like so many soldiers before them, it will be a reminder that the hard fought battle for freedom has been won.	468898053274851

133803223451004	Now that the Senate has passed the Keystone XL Pipeline, I am pleased that they will now take up the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations bill. This legislation responsibly funds DHS and defunds President Obama’s unlawful executive amnesty. I encourage the Senate to pass this bill immediately. We must send a clear message to the President that we will not sit idly by and allow him to circumvent the people’s representatives in Congress and disregard the rule of law. Last week, I was proud to join 43 of my colleagues in a letter to Leader McConnell urging the Senate to consider this important legislation after finishing their work on the Keystone Pipeline.

133803223451004	Today CMS is expected to announce further cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. Cuts cost seniors and threaten access to care. President Obama and CMS should instead work with Congress to strengthen and protect Medicare Advantage.	272077349623590
79663724861	I voted against HR 2596, the bill authorizing federal government intelligence activities for 2016. It would prohibit closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, hamstring government efforts to identify and respond to cyber threats, and continue the GOP malpractice of funding routine defense and intelligence operations through the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) loophole to avoid budget sequestration caps.	10153058694214862
79663724861	I just voted against legislation that stiffs American workers and seniors. This legislation would have authorized Trade Adjustment Assistance for Americans who’d lose their jobs from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, but it was deeply flawed. \n\nIt would have hurt seniors by cutting nearly a billion dollars from Medicare AND it would have severely underfunded TAA. \n\nWe shouldn’t be cutting Medicare to pay for unrelated federal programs. Any savings from Medicare should be pumped right back into the Medicare Trust Fund. \n\nIt wouldn’t have come close to addressing the needs of all those who’d lose their jobs as a result of the TPP trade deal. \n\nWe shouldn’t be stiffing American seniors. We shouldn’t be stiffing American workers. We shouldn’t be approving Fast Track, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or a deeply flawed TAA bill.	10153049243024862
79663724861	I just voted no on “Fast Track” Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)  for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. Congress shouldn’t give up its ability to revise such a major trade bill, which could hurt millions of American workers’ jobs. We shouldn’t be approving Fast Track OR the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	10153049231939862

79663724861	Our nation’s roads and bridges are falling apart. Maintenance and improvement of our transportation infrastructure has been underfunded for years – the backlog of deferred maintenance alone exceeds $1 trillion. \n\nNow, the federal Highway Trust Fund will shut down at the end of this month unless Congress acts soon – putting 6,000 construction projects and 660,000 construction jobs at risk. \n\nLet’s not just opt for another temporary fix. It’s time Congressional Republicans stopped this foolishness and showed some backbone by supporting a long-term solution to the Highway Trust Fund shortfall (like the PA legislature did when it made the politically unpopular but necessary decision to increase fuel taxes in 2013).	10152969450804862
79663724861	I joined a bipartisan House majority today in approving a clean funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security for the rest of the year, ending the House GOP’s months-long effort to put politics over the safety of American families and shut down the agency that protects our borders.	10152821476119862
79663724861	I’ve cosponsored a clean DHS bill, signed a letter asking Speaker Boehner to let us vote on a clean DHS bill, and just voted to bring a clean DHS bill to the House Floor for a vote. \n\nThe House GOP should stop this foolish game of chicken and bring a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the rest of 2015.	10152783069404862
79663724861	I just voted against HR 30, a GOP bill that would result in a MILLION Americans losing their employer-provided health insurance and increase federal budget deficits and the national debt by $53 billion over the next 10 years.	10152709096234862

79663724861	I voted last night for a bill to end the federal government shutdown and avoid defaulting on our national debt. The government is open again. The resolution only funds the government and lifts the debt ceiling for a few months; that will give Republicans and Democrats time to sit down and negotiate a long-term budget plan going forward, with neither side getting everything it wants, but with the pressure still on to reach an agreement. Our economy needs less uncertainty to grow faster and create jobs. I hope we’ve seen the last of these economic “crises” that the Tea Party has manufactured over the last 2½ years – they’ve cost our economy billions of dollars and millions of jobs.	10151757854779862
79663724861	I voted against the House Republican Leadership's Continuing Resolution (CR) for MANY reasons – for example, it wouldn't adequately fund essential federal services; it defunds implementation of the Affordable Care Act;  and it contains the #payChinafirst provision that puts bondholders like China ahead of our military personnel, veterans, seniors, and children if the federal government defaults on the national debt...AND may well make default more likely.	10151707967629862
79663724861	I voted against HR 3102, a phony “healthy forest” bill that would gut federal environment/wildlife protection laws, require each unit of the National Forest system to meet annual timber volume targets of half of what the forest grows each year, and shortchange local governments that receive Secure Rural Schools payments.	10151707961484862
79663724861	SNAP benefits lift American families out of poverty. 1.8 million Pennsylvanians and 47 million Americans rely on #SNAP to fight hunger. SNAP feeds mostly kids, seniors, & disabled. Recipients currently get $1.40 a meal – about $4 a day. That’s not a lot – but it means a lot to the people who otherwise would go hungry. We must protect these crucial benefits. Instead of working to #EndHungerNow, House Republicans just voted to cut nearly $40 billion from SNAP. I voted against these cuts and, in fact, I’ve cosponsored a bill to extend the current #SNAP benefit levels, which are scheduled to expire in November. #SaveSNAP	10151706254034862

79663724861	The Supreme Court’s rejection of the Defense of Marriage Act is a huge victory for civil rights and the American principles of fairness and compassion.  As a result, the federal government will no longer discriminate against LGBT Americans. It’s another step forward in the progress we’ve made towards achieving the ideals our nation was founded upon. This is a big win for the LGBT community and all of us who support marriage equality.  On top of that, #SCOTUS dismissed Proposition 8 – which only affects one state but, hey, it’s the biggest one!  It’s a partial victory, but it means marriage equality for thousands in California – and most likely more Americans in the future.  There’s still more work to do, but today’s decisions on #DOMA and #PROP8 decisions are huge victories for #LGBT rights and marriage equality.	10151539549129862
79663724861	The Roberts Court is nothing if not consistent; I’m angry but not  surprised that #SCOTUS threw out Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act (#VRA). Practically speaking, the Court’s ruling ends the protection that the Voting Rights Act has provided to millions of Americans living in states that had denied them the ability to vote (and in many cases, I believe, are still trying to prevent them from voting).	10151537675469862
79663724861	I voted against the House farm bill which would have subsidized big agriculture companies while cutting food aid for the poor.	10151528061624862
79663724861	I just signed the discharge petition demanding an up or down vote on the Student Loan Relief Act, which would keep interest rates on subsidized Stafford Student loans at 3.4 percent for the next two years. If Congress doesn’t act, interest rates on subsidized Stafford Student loans will jump to 6.8 percent on July 1. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service concluded that if the Republican alternative (HR 1911) were enacted, individuals with subsidized Stafford Student loans would see their costs increase EVEN MORE than if Congress does nothing. I voted against HR 1911.	10151515684709862

79663724861	I agree with President Obama’s call for investing in job creation and economic growth. We need to get deficits under control, but we’re more likely to do that with investments in our economy than with misguided austerity measures like sequestration and other deep cuts. We also need to adopt common-sense gun safety measures like those the President has proposed and I have supported for years.	10151324530644862

69862092533	Today I joined with Congressman Ralph Abraham, the Chairman Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs to organize an oversight briefing at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Regional Office.\n\nExactly two months ago, the VA Office of Inspector General released their report which detailed the consequences of a profoundly corrosive and distrustful climate at the Philadelphia VARO. A lack of accountability and the absence of proper checks and balances allowed those entrusted with meeting the needs of their customers – in this case veterans who served and fought for our country – to implement improper and dishonest practices.\n\nLearn more about today's briefing here:  http://tinyurl.com/os8r8wv\n\nMy thanks to Chairman Abraham, to Congressman Sanford D.

69862092533	Today, I, and 190 of my House Republican colleagues, joined by 28 Democrats, supported passage of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to ensure that American businesses and farmers won’t be denied access to over forty percent of the global marketplace. This vote was as a victory for American workers, manufacturers, farmers and service providers who produce and export goods or services throughout the world. The ability to access markets is crucial to our nation’s continued economic prosperity, strategic interests and to the advancement of our founding principle of freedom. \n\nI have consistently supported the expansion of American trade based on the following three premises:\n\n1.) that rules-based trade is beneficial;\n2.) that the rules of any trade agreement our country enters into must be enforceable;\n3.) that economic success and prosperity are not achievable through economic isolation.\n\nOver 1.6 million Pennsylvanians depend on trade to support their jobs and to provide for their families. Pennsylvania has more than 15,000 companies, approximately 14,000 of which are small and medium-sized enterprises with fewer than 500 employees, who export from locations across the Commonwealth. In the 15th District, companies of all sizes like ColdEdge Technologies and Lutron in the Lehigh Valley, Materion Performance Alloys in Berks County and Hershey’s in Dauphin County are classic examples of why TPA is necessary. These companies, and the good-paying jobs they provide, are dependent on revenues derived from trade.\n\nTPA allows America to set the standards and rules that will govern international trade. It’s a shame that critics of this agreement fail to acknowledge that if America retreats and retrenches from the global economic marketplace, the vacuum will be filled by China. \n\nDoes anyone even remotely believe that China will set reasonable humanitarian standards and trade rules in an area of the world they are seeking to control? Had today’s TPA vote failed we would all have been able to hear the sound of champagne bottles being uncorked in Beijing.\n\n#TPA #FreeTrade #OpenMarkets	10153315741942534

69862092533	As the Chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies I sent a letter to my House colleagues regarding efforts to undermine strong bipartisan support for the Fiscal Year 2016 Appropriations bill, H.R. 2029 which appropriates funds to meet the needs of our veterans. The bill was voice voted by the full House Appropriations Committee last week (meaning there were no objections to it). It is scheduled to be debated on the House floor tomorrow, Wednesday, April 29. \n \nIt is important to get the facts out in response to this concerted effort undercutting a solid example of bipartisan legislative action. This bill sets aside an unprecedented amount of funds to meet the needs of our veterans. For anyone to claim otherwise, for them to attempt to deprive those who have served by derailing a bill that has long enjoyed overwhelming broad bipartisan support, is putting politics ahead of America’s veterans.\n\nMYTH:  The MilCon-VA FY 2016 Appropriations bill “cuts” VA funding\n \nREALITY:  The FY 2016 MilCon-VA Appropriations bill, H.R. 2029, provides a $3.6 billion INCREASE for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The bill totals $68.7 BILLION—5.6% above last year’s level –the highest level of VA funding ever.\n \nMYTH:  The House bill cuts major construction projects \n \nREALITY:  H.R. 2029 provides $562 million for major construction, the same as last year’s level.  Remember this is the same Department responsible for a $930 million cost overrun at the Denver VA hospital – a grossly mismanaged project that the VA has completely bungled.\n \nMYTH:  The House bill cuts the “equivalent” of 70,000 veterans from receiving medical care\n \nREALITY:  The House bill actually provides an increase of $3.8 billion for medical care, plus $4 billion for information technology investments to make that care even better.  In addition, Congress has also provided the VA $15 billion for health care through the Veterans Choice Act.   Bottom line: The VA has the resources and the flexibility to care for every qualified veteran at a VA facility or through private care.\n \nMYTH:  More money is the answer to every management problem.\n \nREALITY:  The VA itself admits to a “corrosive culture” which wastes energy, time and money and diverts attention away from the veteran.  This bill focuses resources on putting veterans care first and provides the much needed oversight functions that taxpayers deserve.\n\n#MeetingVeteransNeeds #BipartisanSupport U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs	10153207862827534

69862092533	Today the House passed H.Con.Res. 27, a measure establishing the budget for the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2016 and setting forth a budget framework for the next ten years. The vote was 228 to 199.\n\nMoving the budget process forward is important for the country. Members of the House fulfilled our governing responsibility to present and pass a budget. For too many years, this was not the norm in Washington.\n\nCompare the efforts of House Republicans to that of President Obama. President Obama again put forward a budget that not even members of his own party are willing to support. When brought to the floor of the Senate, President Obama’s budget received only one vote.\n\nToday’s vote brought needed stability to the budget process and started the ball rolling. Ultimately, the Appropriations Committee in the House will need to mark-up and pass the spending bills that apportion funds to specific programs.  As Chairman of the House Appropriation Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I will work throughout this process to protect our veterans and our active service members and to meet their needs.\n\n#Budget	10153129658957534

69862092533	Today I voted to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the end of Fiscal Year 2015. The House passed the measure by a vote of 257 to 167.\n\nThis negotiated, bipartisan Homeland Security Appropriations legislation is a good bill.  If you oppose illegal immigration, and support strong border security and interior enforcement, then you should support this bill. Furthermore, at a time of increased terrorist activity around the globe, it is essential that America is protected by a fully functioning Homeland Security Department.\n\nI worked on the underlying appropriations bill as a Member of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. The legislation includes:\n\n* the largest operational force of Border Patrol agents and CBP officers in history;\n\n* a provision to fully fund E-Verify;\n\n* an increase of almost $700 million for Immigration and Customs Enforcement;\n\n* the first responder grant programs that are critical to so many state and local departments;\n\n* important steps toward the implementation of a biometric entry and exit data system;\n\n* programs to thwart cyber-attacks;\n\n* funding to maintain our Coast Guard.\n\nWhile I strongly oppose President Obama’s Executive Action on immigration, his action is not going to be resolved through the annual appropriations process; it is being addressed in federal court.  It is unfortunate that this vital national security legislation became a vehicle for ‘Inside-the-Beltway’ game-playing.\n\nThe House will now move away from this immediate cliff and hopefully demonstrate that we have the capacity to govern and find solutions to the many pressing problems facing our nation.\n\n#DHSFunding U.S. Coast Guard Immigration And Customs Enforcement (ICE) Department of Homeland Security	10153078842352534

69862092533	It’s disappointing to see President Obama veto the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Building the Keystone Pipeline would create jobs, increase North American energy independence, improve our domestic energy infrastructure and strengthen our relationship with Canada.  Unfortunately, President Obama has once again demonstrated that to him ideology trumps good governance and the will of the American people. The construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline brings together Americans from across the political spectrum. It brings together business and labor with organizations like the National Association of Manufacturers and the Laborers’ International Union of North America strongly supporting the project. Despite President Obama’s veto, I believe Congress should continue its bipartisan effort to get this infrastructure project underway.\n\n#KeystoneXL	10153064291052534

Today’s job report shows a lot of good news we can all support: 288,000 new jobs for Americans, higher wages, and more people entering the workforce.  We’ve still got a lot of work to do, but I am confident that, if we work together, we can create conditions conducive to creating more new jobs. Commonsense policies like tax simplification, increased opportunities for trade, and regulatory reform can help us build on this good news.	10152959963328753

94156528752	My thoughts on Prime Minister Netanyahu's address to Congress: “With the intense focus on the rise of the Islamic State in recent months, I’m glad that Prime Minister Netanyahu reminded us of the potent threat a nuclear Iran presents to the Middle East. The Iranian regime’s willingness to use terrorism to accomplish its goals makes it impossible to tolerate their development of nuclear weapons. We cannot lose sight of just how much devastation could come from Iran becoming a nuclear power. I want to thank the Prime Minister for his words and his contribution to the debate over a proper nuclear deal.”	10152753878773753

94156528752	I voted for the budget agreement. The agreement the House passed is far from a perfect bill, but it is what we should expect from divided government. This bill prevents another government shutdown without raising taxes, which should provide stability for individuals and businesses still struggling in a tough economy.\n\nThe budget bill temporarily reduces cuts under sequestration but preserves this tool that has helped us reduce the deficit in the past two years. If we do not come together and agree on further deficit cutting measures, the full sequestration will return in 2015.\n\nI’m under no illusions, we cannot fix our budget problems with meager compromises like the one before us tonight. We have to come together soon to get our nation’s finances in order. Hopefully, as sequestration continues, we can come together and pass a more lasting budgetary reform.	10151864375268753
94156528752	Today, House negotiators went to the Capitol to talk over our differences with the Senate. Senate Democrats refused to talk to them. We are never going to solve our problems if we can’t even get in the same room and talk.\n\nThe House today consider bills to reopen portions of our government like the Department of Veterans Affairs and National Parks. The Senate already agreed earlier in the week to fund pay for service members. Hopefully, by working together on smaller funding bills, this will jump start negotiations on the rest of the federal government.\n\nDivided government is hard, but it is not impossible. As Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, I’ve negotiated compromise bills to reform the FDA, to protect our pharmaceuticals from contamination and to reform Medicare payments to doctors. These bipartisan agreements were achieved only through hard and honest negotiations.	10151713963428753
94156528752	Sitting down and talking this out is the only way to move forward and end this shutdown. Last night, the House worked to pass another compromise bill to keep the government open. Instead of meeting us half way, the Senate again rejected the legislation on a party line vote.\n\nIn order to reopen the government as soon as possible, the House has appointed members to negotiate a new bill. Instead of choosing Senators to work with the House, Democrat Senate leaders rejected even this constructive overture.	10151713540903753
94156528752	While I’ve listened closely to the President and his advisors, I do not support using military action in Syria. Had the President pushed for a vote on authorization this week, I would have voted no. My main concern is that we could make matters worse, potentially harming innocent lives and possibly sparking a regional war.\n\nWe should certainly be skeptical of the new Russian proposal, but we must investigate all potential diplomatic efforts to eliminate Syrian chemical weapons. We must not forget that the Russians have been blocking efforts in the United Nations and supplying the regime with weapons.	10151672464508753
94156528752	I'm pleased that President Obama is seeking the consent of Congress before taking military action in Syria. When I return to Washington, I hope that we are presented with a clear strategy that would both discourage further use of chemical weapons and avoid entangling our nation or our allies in this civil war.	10151657110433753

248507065275406	Tonight, the U. S. House voted to place the interests of greedy Wall Street investment bankers ahead of regular American working families.  The Continuing Resolution/Omnibus bill, which passed by a narrow 219-206, guts important Dodd-Frank safeguards against a repeat of the $700 billion taxpayer bailout of Wall Street financiers.  It also exponentially raises the limits on campaign contribution cash that wealthy individuals (like Wall Street bankers) can donate to federal political parties.  In one bill, House Speaker John Boehner has managed both to jeopardize the American economy and further to weaken the foundations of our American democracy itself.  I voted "no."	617498438376265

Today, nearly 100 voices echoed across Capitol Hill as the Treatment Advocacy Center hosted a gathering of families who experienced personal tragedy as a result of  severely ill loved one who was unable or unwilling to seek treatment - often with heartbreaking and tragic outcomes.

Cornerstone TeleVision now broadcasts twenty-four hours a day across North America.\nThank you Don Black, President of Cornerstone and Chris Mitchell, Middle East Bureau Chief, for having me back in studio to appear on "Real Life."

Tune in to Cornerstone TV to watch.	915840041791516
105769762798552	Something is desperately wrong with our nation’s response to the prescription drug and heroin abuse epidemic. Everyday 120 people die from a drug overdose and the vast majority are due to prescription opioid medications.  That’s more than 43,000 deaths last year, or the equivalent of one jetliner going down every single day. Yet only about 10% of those with a substance abuse disorder will get any form of medical care and of those lucky enough to get care, only 10% will get evidence-based treatment. So what does the government fund with your tax dollars? Methadone clinics and buprenorphine prescriptions. This is government-supported addiction. Our leading public health agencies, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, have no practical guidance on how to get people off of prescribed opioids.  We can’t remain misguided in our approach to how we solve this crisis. I believe in recovery. I believe in lives being restored and every individual living up to their full God-given potential and doing so drug free. We have to set our eyes on the goal of full recovery, not just addiction maintenance. Learn more from my Oversight hearing: http://1.usa.gov/1GsqrEd	912351075473746

105769762798552	This morning I chaired the Congressional Steel Caucus annual "State of Steel" hearing in Washington to examine the current landscape of our American steel industry and what to expect in the coming year.  We still have the best steel products, steel manufacturers and steel producers right here in the USA. We still have a surge of foreign imports flooding the market and we still have foreign competitors manipulating their currency to as a way to keep the prices of their products artificially low. But the latest and most disturbing trend on the horizon is how China is looking to buy steel assets abroad, potentially here in the United States. Simply put - we're just not going to let that happen. You can find my statement, and those of the hearing witnesses, up on my website Murphy.house.gov/congressionalsteelcaucus	912331728809014
105769762798552	Shot down over Vietnam on his 93rd mission, Air Force Colonel Leo Thorsness was captured and transported to the Hanoi Hilton. Last night I heard him recount his six-years in captivity, being brutalized and tortured, yet never giving up or losing his faith in the Lord. While still being held in captivity as POW, Col Thorsness was awarded the Medal of Honor, America’s highest award for combat heroism which you can see around his neck in these pictures. What an honor to meet a man of such courage, conviction and faith!	911865192189001
105769762798552	It was an honor to recognize World War II veterans, Army Pvt. Clarence H. Brockman, 94, of McDonald and Merchant Marine Howard W. Pfeifer, 91, of Franklin Park with a special Congressional recognition in front of their families and a grateful community of neighbors and friends. These two men are the embodiment of heroism and sacrifice, having fought in the D-Day landings on June 6, 944 in Normandy. Just this past March 4th, Brockman and Pfeifer both received the French Legion of Honor from Consul General Olivier Serot-Almeras in Washington. The French government dedicated its highest decoration to these World War II veterans, honoring their service in the liberation of Europe. Joining me in honoring our two hometown heroes was State Mayor Terry Bennett, Police Chief Mark Dorsey, State Senator Camera Bartolotta, and Anthony Saveikis District Magistrate and State Rep. Ortitay.	909999669042220
105769762798552	Annual Washington County Farm Bureau Spring Dinner this weekend. It's frustrating to hear just how much the EPA interferes with local farmers and family-run businesses, all who play by the rules and do what's right for the community and the environment. We'll keep fighting back.  Thanks to all who participated and a special thanks to Dave Bentrem, State Committee Chair of the Young Farmers and Ranchers of Western Pennsylvania.	909997789042408
105769762798552	Just returned from the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems annual event: "Behavioral Healthcare Leadership in Action." I challenged everyone in the audience to join me in my efforts because now is the time for battle. Now is the time to choose sides. No more denying science on serious mental illness. No more pretending schizophrenia is a behavioral choice. No more being satisfied with the disastrous status quo. In America we have a "Fail First" mental health system. No more. We are going to change it to CARE FIRST and pass my Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act. We're going to deliver Treatment BEFORE tragedy.	907512312624289

186949061341027	Very proud to congratulate Loretta Lynch on her confirmation today as our nation’s highest-ranking law enforcement official. During her tenure as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Attorney General Lynch demonstrated her commitment to protecting civil rights, fighting political corruption, and holding the financial industry accountable. I am confident that as Attorney General she will continue to serve our nation with distinction and build on the strong record that Attorney General Eric Holder has established over the course of his tenure.\n\n---David	828511770518083
186949061341027	This weekend, Rhode Islanders are coming together with family and loved ones in order to commemorate the holidays of Passover and Easter. While these celebrations are unique, they come from the same well of faith that teaches us to always look after one another, stand up for justice, and never lose hope for the things that are yet to come. \n\nWe would all do well to live our lives by these shared values and  to keep them in mind as we work to build a stronger America.  \n\nI wish all who are celebrating this weekend a Happy Passover and Happy Easter.	819924224710171

The Rhode Island Jewish community has made tremendous contributions to our state, imparting shared values of family, faith and service to the community. I wish all Rhode Islanders celebrating Rosh Hashanah a good and sweet New Year. Shanah Tovah.	727483523954242
186949061341027	In case you missed it, I discussed the Democratic agenda to help invest in America’s middle class and the work to be done this month to help grow our economy, rebuild our infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, ensuring young people have access to an affordable education, and guaranteeing equal pay for equal work: http://youtu.be/udhCAI_RHoM	722924887743439
186949061341027	Last night, President Obama delivered a bold speech about economic growth, equal opportunity and the promise of the American dream. I applaud his focus on middle class economics and shared prosperity that set the right tone for the year ahead and reflects the priorities of hardworking Rhode Islanders and their families.\n\nThe President’s vision embraced the truth that the success of our economy depends on the strength and vitality of the middle class. And, even as our economy continues to recover, many Americans, including many Rhode Islanders, are being left out, and we must advance policies that ensure everyone shares in our country’s growing prosperity, not just the wealthy few. The agenda the President outlined to help younger Americans afford community college, make childcare more affordable, help families buy homes, strengthen manufacturing, reform our broken tax code to put more money in the pockets of working Americans, and raise wages will help achieve this forward-thinking goal.\n\nDuring his speech, the President challenged Congress to come together and find solutions that will ensure the economic recovery reaches every family in every neighborhood. It is our responsibility and my hope that we will find common ground to advance the priorities of the American people and strengthen the middle class for years to come. I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues to keep moving forward and achieve this bold vision.	787166147985979

186949061341027	Being sworn in to the 114th Congress today was an incredible honor and I am tremendously grateful for the privilege to return to Congress to serve the people of Rhode Island. The 114th Congress will present many opportunities and many challenges. I will continue to focus on the priorities of hardworking Rhode Islanders and their families by working with my colleagues to grow the economy, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, revitalize American manufacturing, enhance public safety, make education more accessible and affordable, and bring more federal resources to the state. I encourage anyone seeking assistance with an issue regarding the federal government to consider my office a resource. I am truly humbled that the people of Rhode Island have given me the honor of representing them for the next two years and I pledge to fight for their priorities every day.	780166118685982
186949061341027	Governor Mario Cuomo was a leading voice for liberal causes, a fiercely proud Italian-American, and a passionate advocate for economic opportunity and equality for all. He was a champion for working families and the disadvantaged. As the son of poor Italian immigrants who rose to become the governor of one of the largest states in the country, Governor Cuomo faithfully led the state of New York through difficult economic times and embodied the promise of the American Dream. His passing is a great loss for New York and the nation. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Matilda, his sons and their entire family.	776409825728278
186949061341027	I wish you and your family a very happy, healthy and peaceful New Year. \n \nToday, Americans all across the country are making resolutions to improve their daily lives and the communities in which they live. We make these resolutions with a sense of hope and promise about the future and with a deep understanding of our ability to make a difference.  And we make these pledges because we understand our responsibility to move forward in a positive and constructive way as we confront the challenges ahead.     \n \nAs we welcome this New Year, we also welcome the start of a new Congress, and this month I will be meeting with Rhode Islanders across our state to hear from those I serve about their priorities and be sure I incorporate them in my legislative work plan for the 114th Congress.  I do this with the hope and knowledge that by working together we can make this Congress more productive than the last. It’s with this spirit of new beginnings, hope and determination that we can create a brighter future for all Rhode Islanders in 2015 and the years to follow. \n \nAgain, I hope you have a very happy New Year.	775221759180418

186949061341027	Tonight's vote was a huge giveaway to Wall Street and encourages the unscrupulous speculation and excessive greed that nearly brought our economy to its knees. The Republican-led House approved this spending bill that was crafted behind closed doors, does the bidding of the biggest banks on Wall Street and could put taxpayers on the hook for the risky behavior of large financial institutions -- the same type of reckless behavior that resulted in the financial crash of 2008. Another provision allows wealthy, powerful special interests to buy more influence in Washington by pouring more money into our elections and drowning out the voices of ordinary Americans in our democracy. The spending measure also compromises our national security by failing to provide long term funding for the Department of Homeland Security. This bill represents a big giveaway to the most powerful special interests in this country at the expense of everyday Americans and I could not, in good conscious, support this bill.	765236243512303
186949061341027	The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report is deeply disturbing. Among the many findings, this report reveals that the CIA employed more brutal interrogation techniques than had been previously detailed publicly, deliberately misled Congress and the White House about the program’s effectiveness, and damaged the United States’ reputation around the world. These abuses are a violation of basic human rights and are in stark contrast to our values as a nation, and this report provides further confirmation that these techniques simply fail to provide results that strengthen our national security. I applaud the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee for their efforts to provide the American people with an account of the actions carried out in their name. It is now our duty as elected officials, and American citizens who believe in the values upon which our nation was founded, to ensure serious violations such as this never occur again.	764233250279269
6578978441	The food economy is an essential piece of the overall economy in our state, especially in relation to tourism and hospitality. Over the past two years, I have met some exceptional business owners and entrepreneurs in this growing industry, and I will continue to support food as an agent of growth in the Ocean State.

70150469414	Happy 107th birthday to the U.S. Army Reserves! I am honored to have started my military service in the Reserves where I served from 1972 until 1975. The Reserves have served our nation diligently as citizen-soldiers, and I am grateful for their service. #ArmyReserve107	10153456058764415
186949061341027	Today, families all across Rhode Island and our country will gather together to give thanks for our many blessings. I am thankful for the opportunity to spend time with friends and family, and for the privilege of serving you in Congress.  Like all Rhode Islanders, I am especially thankful to the many brave men and women who serve in our armed forces and protect the freedoms we enjoy.\n\nDuring this holiday season, we should also remember our neighbors and the responsibility that we have to look after one another and to ensure that the full bounty of the opportunities of our great country are available to all.  As families across the country and in Rhode Island struggle to make ends meet, it’s important that we rededicate ourselves to the promise that everyone deserves a fair shot at success for themselves and their families. \n\nDespite the challenges we face today, let’s remember that as Americans we enjoy freedoms and blessings unlike anywhere else in the world and that our values as a nation have always led us toward prosperity. From the time the Pilgrims and the Wapanoag tribe celebrated the first Thanksgiving in 1621, we have always come together as one people, to share in our good fortune, mindful that our best days lie ahead.\n\nI wish you and your family a very Happy Thanksgiving.	758787927490468
186949061341027	Tonight, President Obama took a historic step in addressing our broken immigration system and outlined a bold plan to keep families together by providing relief to millions of individuals working to build a better life for themselves and their families. In addition, his plan will help to secure our border, grow the economy and set the right priorities for the law enforcement community. A majority of Americans agree that we must act on immigration reform in a way that reflects our values and reinforces the promise that America is a land of hope and opportunity, and I applaud President Obama’s decision to take executive action to align our immigration policy with our national values. \n\nThe President’s executive order, when implemented, will provide temporary protection and relief to immigrant families that have been forced to live in the shadows. Congress, of course, has the power and responsibility to provide a lasting solution and a pathway to citizenship for aspiring Americans. I will continue to press Speaker Boehner to allow a vote on the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate 17 months ago. Every day House Republicans fail to act, millions of hardworking immigrants and their families continue to suffer. To be sure, with House Republicans standing in the way of congressional action, President Obama has the legal authority and moral responsibility to use his constitutional powers to provide the necessary and appropriate relief to families.\n\nPresident Obama’s decision tonight reflects the best of our American values: that we are a country of opportunity, built by immigrants, and strengthened by our commitment to basic notions of justice and fairness.	755843431118251

186949061341027	I strongly condemn the brutal murder of innocent civilians, including three Americans, who were praying in a synagogue in Jerusalem today. Such senseless acts of violence are contemptible, and the U.S., Israel, and our international allies must work to promote peace and religious tolerance throughout the region. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this horrific violence and their families.	754789061223688
186949061341027	Today I was proud to celebrate the display of the Armenian Orphan Rug at the White House Visitor Center. This great artifact is both a symbol of the strong relationship between Armenia and the U.S., and a stark reminder about the first genocide of the modern era where 1.5 million Armenians perished at the hands of the Ottoman empire. Together with leaders in the American-Armenian community we successfully worked with The White House to make sure the Armenian Orphan Rug and its historical meaning will be shared with the country.	754788697890391
186949061341027	Today I was pleased the House of Representatives approved legislation to reauthorize the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Estuary Program, which awards grants to the nation’s 28 national estuaries to safeguard the health of important coastal ecosystems across the country, including Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay. The National Estuary Program, created by the late Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island provides critical funds for the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program to help preserve and protect our state’s waterways. Narragansett Bay is an essential part of Rhode Island’s economy and culture, and connects Rhode Islander’s with nature and the sea. It’s important that we continue to protect this natural treasure for future generations to enjoy.	751775571525037
186949061341027	This week I was honored to meet with Rhode Island veterans to salute their service and sacrifice. I joined with students at the Community College of Rhode Island in Lincoln to honor their peers who have served, took part in ceremonies with veterans and constituents in Woonsocket and Cumberland, and heard female soldiers share their experiences at a luncheon in their honor hosted by Operation Stand Down Rhode Island. Our veterans have kept our country safe and continue to protect the liberties we hold dear. As Americans, we live in a free and safe society because of their valiant efforts and extraordinary sacrifices. I will continue to fight in Congress to fulfill the obligations our government has promised to those who have served, and I want to offer my humblest gratitude to the veterans in Rhode Island and around the nation for their service.	751730081529586

186949061341027	Today’s Supreme Court action ensures millions of Americans will have the freedom to marry, and affirms that bigotry and discrimination are inconsistent with American values of equality and justice under the law. 19 states, including Rhode Island, have recognized marriage equality, a majority of Americans support same-sex marriage and the courts and the Obama Administration have worked expeditiously to advance equal protections for same-sex couples. Today the Court's decision is another important step toward full marriage equality for the LGBT community.\n\nHowever the fight is not over for millions of Americans who are still denied the right to marry and Congress must extend equal protection of the law to all by ensuring full marriage equality for all Americans. This can be accomplished by full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act and enactment of the Respect for Marriage Act.	733075506728377

6578978441	As we celebrate both Read Across America Week and National School Breakfast Week, I’m so grateful to the teachers, administrators and school personnel who teach our children and keep them safe, healthy and happy. Literacy is at the core of education, and a love of reading can inspire a young person and set them on a path to future success. Strong reading skills are important for all other classroom subjects, and significantly impact student achievement. And if we want our children to maximize learning, they need to be well nourished. No one can truly absorb new material or get excited about school on an empty stomach, and the cafeteria staffs who ensure full bellies play their own important role in education.	10153145096238442

I am especially encouraged that we have the most diverse Congress in history, and I believe this will bring a wealth of new perspectives and ideas to the process. Congratulations to all the Members of Congress being sworn in today, and I am eager to work with all of you to make Rhode Island and America stronger.	10153007872143442

6578978441	I am saddened to learn that James Brady, a tireless advocate for public safety and a man who long led the fight against gun violence, has died at the age of 73. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family during their time of loss, especially his wife, Sarah, who has always been by his side. We will forever be grateful for his contributions to this country.\n\nAlready a success in his career as press secretary for former President Ronald Reagan, Brady’s greatest accomplishments were yet to come. He took a bad situation and used it as a platform to change the public discussion of gun violence. The assassination attempt on President Reagan left Brady near death, but with incredible strength and perseverance, he fought his way back and went on to dedicate decades of his life to a cause that is close to my heart. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act is arguably the most significant piece of gun violence prevention legislation this nation has enacted, and it provides us with a framework going forward. We cannot lose sight of Brady's goal of keeping this country safe and keeping guns out of the wrong hands, and I will continue to work hard to bring his vision to fruition.\n\nBrady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence	10152604067388442

118387985037658	Today, the House passed the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 by a vote of 247 to 178. I opposed passage of the bill, which is an extension of other bills that have already raised serious constitutional questions in just the past few months. Allow me to explain in a bit more detail.\n\nLet’s start with the surveillance capacity currently granted the NSA from the USA FREEDOM Act. During that debate, some of us have raised concerns about Section 215, which had been used to make bulk collections of data against U.S. citizens. Though the USA FREEDOM Act provided some changes to Section 215, it did not significantly change the fact that data collections without a warrant can proceed. This gets to the fundamental question of whether our 4th amendment rights are really being protected given the notion that bulk data collection can still continue. This is a big deal….at two levels. On the first, the Founding Fathers believed passionately in the fallibility of man. No matter how well intended, man’s nature included failure and accordingly they believed in checks and balances as much as anything as a safeguard against man’s ability to mess things up. It was never about efficiency, but rather guarding individual freedom. So on these issues they would agree that mass data collection might be more efficient…but at odds with their notion of the fragile nature of man. Who would watch over those who watch over? \n\nSecondly, they put the Fourth Amendment in because not only were the folks in charge prone to failure and sin, all of us as citizens were too. They did not want a British soldier coming into one’s house without reasonable cause, and a warrant, and rooting around long enough until they found something to charge one with. So it is with bulk data collection, root around long enough in our stuff and there is a reasonable chance that some of us would be guilty of something….thus the need for a warrant and probable cause first. These are important themes, and the basis of much of the debate around the Intel bill.\n\nAdditionally, there is another provision, known as Section 702, which gave the NSA explicit authority to monitor electronic communications, through email, online activities, or phones without a warrant.  Just last year, we learned from the Director of National Intelligence that there have been ongoing warrantless searches under Section 702. Last week, I cosponsored an amendment with Congressman Thomas Massie to limit the use of this provision in the Department of Defense Appropriations bill, and it was adopted.  Unfortunately, a similar amendment was not allowed in this debate.\n\nGiven the back and forth on this issue in Congress and with the Executive Branch, I think it is ultimately time for the courts to review the constitutionality of these provisions against the backdrop of how the agency has used this authority over the past decade.\n\nOn another front, there was also an amendment offered by Congressman Adam Schiff to strike provisions preventing the closure of Guantanamo Bay, which I supported. The Sixth Amendment protects against indefinite detention of prisoners and this is another part of the larger debate on how we should handle the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Unfortunately, the amendment failed by a vote of 176 to 246, but I suspect there will be more debate to come in the coming months.\n\nFinally, a new provision inserted in this legislation would limit the information made available to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), an independent board intended to provide a balance between national security and our civil liberties. In the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks, the PCLOB was the first group to step forward to determine that the bulk data collection practices of the NSA were illegal. This was ultimately upheld by the federal court. Now the Board is in the process of reviewing the use of drones in overseas operations and Executive Order 12333, which is the basis for much of the NSA’s activities. The amendment inserted will have a chilling effect on this Board’s abilities to look at and provide transparency on how national security is affecting our constitutional rights.  \n\nThomas Jefferson is credited with saying “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,” and on the issues of civil liberty now before us in the age of amazing technology that allows for vast governmental oversight, he is particularly right today.	382921505250970
118387985037658	Today, I voted for Trade Promotion Authority, so-called TPA, and given the number of conversations I have had with people at home who felt strongly on the subject, I believe I had to answer several questions. Does my belief in the concept of free trade outweigh my disdain for this President? Is TPA something out of the ordinary? What is at stake here beyond trade itself? How would this help or harm the residents of the First District? There were other considerations as well, but let’s explore these for a moment.\n\nEmpowering the marketplace and trade have long been significant to conservatives. The decisions that can take place in the market give power to the individual over government, and it’s for this reason historically that conservatives favored the trade agreements aimed in that direction. Of course, this in turn caused labor unions to come down hard against TPA. Overwhelmingly, every Democrat in the House and Senate is against the measure that would give the President, of their party, this authority.\n\nThe problem here is this President; it would really not be an issue without him. Given many of his past actions with regard to both the Constitution and Congress, I completely get the idea of not warming to giving him one ounce of additional authority. In this instance, however, he already has the authority to negotiate a trade deal and submit it to Congress for action, so the question becomes whether we can get him to negotiate within the bounds of something Congress might accept. He will be gone in 18 months; multinational trade agreements will be with us for years to come.\n\nOur country, state, and region have been positively impacted by free trade, and about one in four jobs in South Carolina are tied to international trade and investment. The BMWs made in Spartanburg don’t stay here, nor do the things produced by Bosch, Michelin, Boeing or a long list of others, given 80 percent of our exporting companies are small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nAt the onset of the Great Depression, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Act, increasing tariffs on imports to the highest levels in 100 years. Not surprising, other countries responded in kind, and over the next four years world trade decreased by 66 percent. By 1934, Congress completely reversed course and passed legislation granting President Roosevelt authority to negotiate lower tariffs with other countries. Since then, every President has been granted authority to negotiate trade agreements, specifically aimed at lowering tariffs and opening markets for American products. The question I had to ask today was do I vote to change this, though the President will be in office for another 18 months. It’s a particularly timely question now, given 96 percent of the world’s consumers live outside the US.\n\nMany people have confused TPA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an ongoing trade negotiation with 11 Pacific Rim countries that would have to come before Congress for a vote once it is finalized. TPA is a public document, and I have posted in on Facebook earlier this week in its current form. TPP is not a public document, but any legislation related to its enactment would be. Specifically, what TPA calls for is that any trade agreement negotiated under its authority, including TPP, be open to review for about 100 days. Once a deal is made, it is to be available to the public for 60 days, after which Congress has 45 days in which to vote up or down on the bill. In fairness to Paul Ryan and others who worked on TPA, this is an extraordinary level of transparency. Regularly, Congress will be asked to vote on trillion dollar bills of over 1000 pages not with 45 days, but with 48 hours to view the document. That’s not right, and accordingly I vote against bills I don’t have the chance to review. This process sets up something very different that allows all of us to look at what we might like or dislike in TPP and move accordingly. At the end of the day, this bill is about one thing, having a trade agreement negotiated by one party rather than 535 members of Congress. As Governor, I saw first-hand the importance of vesting in one person this authority. Get your best deal, and then we vote it up or down, if reasonable. If not, a negotiation dies a death of a thousand cuts as each interest group wants to add or subtract from it.\n\nFinally, I believe TPA maintains the constitutional balance between the executive and legislative branches. Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution reserves to Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce. In 1890, Congress granted the President authority to negotiate trade agreements with foreign countries, and in a variety of forms Congress has done this ever since. Does this mean any of these deals will be perfect? Absolutely not. Will it not in some form help some businesses more than others, and consequently help or hurt some families more than others. Absolutely. We do not have perfect free trade. I wish we did and will consistently fight in that direction. What we have had, and what this bill I think is all ultimately about, is a general bias for more than 100 years in this country toward open trade and lowering trade barriers. Condoleezza Rice wrote an excellent op-ed in the Washington Post a few days ago, suggesting what happens here goes well beyond trade but rather to America’s place in the world.\n\nI agree with her. It’s important we continue to look for ways to engage with the rest of the world, and trade is our chief means. Trade is important for the way it allows for marketplace decisions that empower the individual rather than government. It’s important in maintaining our way of life and station in life. I wish so much that we could just wait and deal with it after this President is gone, but that was not the decision that came my way. So, after careful review to make sure that TPA passed constitutional muster and what I had seen first-hand as Governor in the importance of charging one person in a negotiation as negotiator, I decided to look beyond the next 18 months of the Obama presidency and keep my eye on the prize of what has fueled more than a considerable portion of America’s place in the world. Does that mean I will vote for TPP; no, it depends what’s in it. Does it mean I will continue to work to hold the President accountable for his steps as dictated by TPA; yes. Does it mean I believe in continuing our larger American commitment to open trade, yes…and on that, I do hope we can find agreement.	380329198843534
118387985037658	Last night, the House voted on the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Bill. The bill would spend $55.2 billion on infrastructure and housing programs and authorize an additional $53.5 billion in spending out of a variety of trust funds, including the Highway Trust Fund. The bill narrowly passed by a vote of 216 to 210. I cast my vote against it for a few different reasons - spending levels, the long term sustainability of our transportation trust funds, and an outdated foreign policy provisions in the bill related to Cuba.\n\nFirst, the bill increases spending by $1.5 billion over last year’s levels. That does not automatically mean that a bill is on the wrong track, but it sure represents a clue. The real question is how that additional money would be spent, and one of the reasons for going through individual spending bills each year is to reward successful programs and cut back or eliminate failing programs. Unfortunately in this case, Congress as a whole has not done its due diligence in regards to these programs, as 98% of the spending in this bill ($106 billion out of $108.7 billion) is on programs whose authorizations have expired. If you agree with many of those I talk to at home that how we spend taxpayer dollars on our infrastructure needs isn’t working, then it’s dangerous to continue to spend more money without first fixing the existing problems….and that is what authorization of programs is supposed to be all about. For example, this bill authorizes a plan to spend more than $40 billion from the Highway Trust Fund next year, knowing that it’s only going to take in $35 billion! This $5 billion dollar deficiency is not a minor problem and one that we can’t paper over. There were other things like this, but the larger point here is that the bill did not deal with the core of many of the challenges inherent in this appropriations bill.\n\nFinally, as I mentioned in a post this Monday, I had introduced an amendment to strike language from the bill that restricted Americans’ ability to travel to Cuba. Americans can visit any country in the world except for Cuba as part of our constitutional right to free travel. In the context of a bill that is supposed to focus on funding our own transportation and infrastructure needs, a Cuba travel ban seemed misplaced. This amendment ultimately failed and although that was not a deciding factor in my vote against the entire bill, I raise it as an example of the type of amendment that had it passed, would have made the bill better. There were a number of other amendments in this category, such as amendments to get rid of $1.1 billion in Amtrak subsidies, eliminate outdated funding for rural airports, and reduce overall spending back to last year’s levels.\n\nThat is now five of 12 appropriations bill that need to be considered by September 30—the Senate has yet to consider a single one. I will keep you updated.	378986008977853
118387985037658	There was some good news and bad news yesterday as concerns the protection of civil liberties in this country. As you may know, on June 1st the authorization expired for Section 215 of the Patriot Act. This was the part of the bill that the NSA and other government agencies used as justification for bulk data collection without the need for a warrant. This was a significant win for those who had argued that this bulk data collection violated our 4th Amendment rights. The good news is that Section 215 as we used to know it is not coming back. The bad news is that it is not gone for good, as the Senate passed the USA Freedom Act yesterday, which reauthorized a different version of bulk data collection.\n\nThis tweak satisfied those who were concerned about the legality of the data collection, but not those of us who had a more fundamental problem with the idea that the government could collect data from entire zip codes without a standard warrant. When the federal district court in New York ruled that the government did not have the authority for its program, there were two paths: either let the program expire or give it explicit authorization. The USA Freedom Act introduces some new limits for the NSA, such as shifting the holding of data over to telecom companies and requiring more detailed orders to access that information. But it also, for the first time, gives explicit authorization to the data collection program. As such, our 4th Amendment rights against warrantless searches could still be violated. The next step for those concerned about liberty is to have the Supreme Court weigh in on the constitutionality of this part of the Patriot Act, but that will be somewhere down the road. \n\nIt is encouraging that despite the preferences of some in the Senate and the House that a simple reauthorization of the program was not jammed through, as can often be the case with controversial issues. This suggests to me that members of Congress are hearing the same concerns that I hear from people at home about government overreach. So although the end result was not ideal, there is momentum for reform. I’ll keep you posted as more develops.	376546585888462
118387985037658	For all too many people across the state and country, Memorial Day simply marks the beginning of summer and represents just another excuse for a three-day weekend. The real meaning of Memorial Day in fact goes well beyond barbecues and sales at Lowes and Walmart. The holiday began as “Decoration Day” after the Civil War, and has gone on to become the day that honors all of the Americans who have died in military service.\n \nAccordingly, it’s a day to think about the sacrifice of a young soldier, sailor, airman or marine who gave their all. The conflicts have ranged from the snowy battlefield that came to be known as nothing more than the Battle of the Bulge, to a place known as Pearl Harbor, or Hue or more recently the white hot sands of the Middle East. In every instance they should be remembered as the living memorials to the words that freedom is not free, and that’s a concept worth reflecting on here on this Memorial Day. As Ronald Reagan said, “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.”  He was right, and accordingly I’d ask that we make it a point to find a veteran and thank them. Most of all, I would ask that we offer a prayer for those who are currently in harm’s way. Happy Memorial Day…	373719329504521
118387985037658	Today the House passed H.R. 2353, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015 by a vote of 387 to 35, which authorizes a short-term extension of federal highway funding through July 31st of this year. There is no new spending associated with this legislation since the Highway Trust Fund that pays for these spending projects will not run dry until the end of July. Without this bill funding for new highway repair projects would have ended on May 31st. This bill is a mere stopgap measure while Congress debates a long term fix for the problem of how to best fund repairs for our roads and bridges, and accordingly I cast my vote in favor but without enthusiasm given it is but a stopgap measure.  I think what is realistically going to happen here is that they will come back again in July with still another stopgap measure that will take us until year end and wait on the Ways and Means Committee for work on corporate tax reform. As the debate continues, I want to highlight a few of the principles I would like to see addressed in a long-term highway bill.\n\nThe first principle is that basic accounting dictates that you don’t spend more than you take in, but that is exactly what the trust fund has been doing. In fact, since 2008, taxpayers have had to bail out the Highway Trust Fund to the tune of $65 billion. Often what will happen is that Congress will get to a point in the year where the trust fund is about to run dry and come up with some creative accounting to make sure that construction stays on track. What doesn’t happen is any meaningful reform. Starting with an approach that says, “Live within your means,” in regards to highway spending would be a good first step in protecting taxpayers’ interests.\n\nSecondly, I think we should limit gas taxes to their original purpose of spending on roads and bridges. Trust funds were created for a reason. Their tax was administered and sold to taxpayers for a given purpose, and I think we should honor that promise and purpose. The Highway Trust Fund collects federal gas taxes (currently at 18.4 cents a gallon of gas) from drivers, but spends on projects like mass transit and bike paths that don’t contribute to the fund. If you’re running $16 billion per year structural deficits, spending $10 billion on projects like these, however well intended or needed, should be dealt with separately from the trust fund which was put into place with a promise on how the gas tax would be used. To that end, I introduced a bill, H.R. 1551, the Highway Restoration Act of 2015, which would fix this part of our highway funding problem by phasing out this spending on mass transit over a period of five years. I think this proposal and others like it should at least be part of the conversation going forward.	371753076367813
118387985037658	Today, the House passed H.R. 1191 the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, by a vote of 400 to 25, which would allow Congress to review any final nuclear deal with Iran and reject it if it falls short of expectations. The same bill passed the Senate by a vote of 98-1 last week. I voted in favor because Congress has a role to play in national security, and there is not a good reason why Congress shouldn’t have oversight of this proposed deal. Put simply, it’s better than nothing, which is the situation Congress would be in without this bill. The bill also mandates reporting requirements and certifications from the executive branch that Iran is meeting the terms of the deal, which means that there is pressure on the administration to keep its eye on the ball.\n \nThat’s the good news. The rest of what the bill entails is not so rosy, and on much of what it promises I am skeptical.\n \nIn fact, Ronald Reagan is famously quoted as saying, “Trust, but verify” in regards to dealing with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. What President Obama is asking Congress and the American people to do in regards to Iran building nuclear weapons is more like “Trust, and we’ll do what we can.” The proposed framework for a deal that is supposed to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power is due by June 30th and what little we know of it so far is troubling. Iran will still be able to enrich uranium, inspections of sites that had previously produced nuclear materials may be restricted, and the U.S. may be giving up what leverage it has left by immediately lifting sanctions on Iran. Other countries in the Middle East have raised concerns about the proposed terms – Saudi Arabia has said that a nuclear Iran could lead it to seek its own nuclear arsenal and Israel has hinted that it would attack Iran before allowing it to develop nuclear weapons. The stage is set for a bad deal and Congress is attempting to weigh in and use its oversight authority on the process. \n  \nThe bottom line in all this is that I remain concerned that this legislation will not be enough to stop a bad deal. It’s arguable that the bill may be effective in terms of oversight, but fall short on accountability over the President’s deal – let me explain. If you want to plant a field, you need a plow, not a hammer. In that vein, with this bill Congress has given itself a hammer, but might find itself staring at a harvest that it can’t reap.  Having the ability to vote for disapproval of a deal with Iran is a fine tool to have in the toolkit, but in order for it to work, enough Members of Congress have to be on board to override a Presidential veto. That is not the case right now. Recently, 150 House Democrats signed a letter in support of the proposed framework – more than enough votes to keep any final deal with Iran in place and so in this regard the promise of stopping what I believe at this point to be a bad deal is an illusion. But time and the knowledge of details can change a lot, so I will keep you updated as this important issue continues to develop.	369421256600995

118387985037658	Can I do a little more “catch-up” from last week? \n\nOK, thanks…here is one more! Last Thursday, the House passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill by a vote of 255 to 163. This was the first spending bill that the House has worked on this year and it funds the Veterans Affairs hospital system and various Department of Defense construction projects at a cost of $76.6 billion. I cast my vote in favor of the overall bill, but wanted to highlight a few interesting amendments that came up and explain my reasoning for each vote.\n\nThe first issue was actually a series of three amendments offered by Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, and my South Carolina colleague Mick Mulvaney. They were attempting to eliminate $532 million in funding for military construction of overseas bases that were paid for by dipping into a special fund, known as the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. It was originally meant to be only for war funding, but it has been stretched to pay for other defense requests that have nothing to do with the war. For instance in this bill, a $220 million missile defense site in Poland and a $103 million airfield in Italy are paid for out of the “war fund” – though not exactly what most would consider the front lines of military action in Afghanistan. \n\nOne recent Harvard study puts the long term costs from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq at over $6 trillion. In that context, piling on more spending that looks from the outside like it is meant for war operations but in reality is for a separate purpose, makes it more difficult for taxpayers to understand the true costs of war. It’s also the case that this money will have to be borrowed, adding to the existing $18.2 trillion in national debt. Overseas Contingency Operations spending is an issue that has come up in the past, but it is particularly significant this year because the overall budget allows for $96 billion in this off-budget spending.  This is a $22 billion increase from last year, even though actual war activities are winding down. I agreed with Mick and Chris’s common sense argument that if the government values something, it should find a way to pay for it in a forthright fashion. We may need missile defense sites in Poland, but if we do let’s build them into the defense budget and not add them to the cost of “war” fighting in the Middle East. Accordingly I cast my vote in favor of their amendments. \n\nA second amendment was offered by Jerry Nadler from New York, which was aimed at closing down Guantanamo Bay. I voted in favor of this amendment, although it failed by a vote of 167 to 254, which would have stripped out the provision of the bill that prohibited funds being used to transfer any prisoner from Guantanamo Bay to a facility in the United States. I have argued consistently that a vital part of the American tradition is not to detain a person indefinitely without charge. Our founding fathers were emphatic on this, and accordingly we should all look to the 6th amendment to the Constitution which ensures the “right to a speedy trial” for those in the custody of the U.S. government. I think we are spilling over to dangerously non-constitutional waters, and a place where we have never been as a country, when someone may spend the rest of their life at Guantanamo Bay with no charges filed. It’s ok to execute, it’s ok to do many things - but I don’t think indefinite detention with no other action or even charge is one of them. I expect that Congress will be taking up this issue again when we deal with defense bills this summer.\n\nThe final amendment that stood out was offered by a bipartisan group that would allow Veterans Affairs doctors in states where medical marijuana is legal to provide a recommendation for their patients. It does not allow them to prescribe it, just to provide recommendations to state licensed doctors to talk about treatment with veteran patients. I voted in favor, although the amendment failed by three votes. In my mind, it came down to the concept of federalism, where most powers were to be left to the states and individuals rather than the federal government. In this case, should the federal government be in the business of usurping all state law? The beauty of the American experiment is that it included “federalism” which allows states to pioneer ideas. Some we may agree with, others not…but the operative question in this instance is whether or not the federal viewpoint should always prevail over the view of the state?	367598133449974
118387985037658	It seemed like Groundhog Day in April on the House floor today, because a cybersecurity bill that passed today is very similar to the cybersecurity bill we passed yesterday – I opposed both of them. Today’s bill, H.R. 1731, National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act, which passed by a vote of 355 to 63, clarifies that the National Cybersecurity and Communication Integration Center is the lead civilian government agency on cybersecurity matters.  The bill also creates incentives for information sharing between the private sector and the federal government.  In comparison with yesterday’s bill (H.R. 1560), this one cut into your Fourth Amendment rights less, but it still raises the larger problem of making our personal information more readily available to the federal government. This bill amounts to yet another expansion of government power at the expense of individual rights. I am also concerned that because this bill will be combined with H.R. 1560 before they are sent to the Senate, any improvements in today’s bill will be left on the cutting room floor.\n\nOne improvement worth noting is that this bill limits the information shared by private companies with the government so that it can only be used for cybersecurity purposes. The government could not use the information to prosecute people for crimes that had nothing to do with cybersecurity, like assaults and robberies. I think this is a commonsense restriction, and I’m not sure why H.R. 1560 did not also include this limit on the federal government’s authority. In that same vein, another distinction is that state and local law enforcement would not be able to use your shared information to prosecute you for crimes unrelated to the internet. This is important because, if not for this limit, I believe it to be a clear violation of the Constitution because the search warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment could be disregarded. While I was glad to see those changes in this legislation, they do not line up with the content of H.R. 1560, so it is unlikely those protections will make the final product.\n\nA second part of this bill still allows Americans’ personal information to be shared with other federal agencies like the NSA and the Department of Defense. As I wrote yesterday, the language in the bill is so broad that it would allow information like your internet activity and your identity to be shared with the government just because your computer has been compromised by hackers. Not every cyberattack rises to the level of a national security threat. As such, I think that national intelligence agencies getting access to your personal data without a specific reason sets a dangerous precedent with regard to our civil liberties. \nFifty-five cybersecurity experts that work for a number of different private sector companies sent a letter in opposition of this bill, stating, “We do not need new legal authorities to share information that helps us protect our systems from future attacks. When a system is attacked, the compromise will leave a trail, and investigators can collect these bread crumbs.” When you see people charged with doing this work every day opposing a bill that the government says is in their industries’ best interests, it raises a red flag for me. I think in this case the private sector knows best on how their customers’ personal information is protected, and we need to listen, especially when our civil liberties are at stake.	362014714008316
118387985037658	Would you believe that after everything we found out about the NSA’s mass surveillance programs that the House would pass a bill that gives the NSA access to more of your personal information? Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened today. The bill, H.R. 1560 Protecting Cyber Networks Act, which passed by a vote of 307 to 116, attempts to provide private companies with a mechanism to share information about cyber attacks with the government. The idea here is that the federal government would be able to use this information to prevent future threats and provide assistance to companies. But while cyber attacks pose a real threat to the U.S, this bill does not balance this newer threat with the historical need to defend the liberties guaranteed to us under the Constitution. This is especially true in regards to the 4th amendment, which protects us against unreasonable search and seizure of property or the issue of warrants without probable cause. I think that this bill misses the mark on securing those protections in a few different ways.\n\nFirst, it would allow private companies like Time-Warner to share your online information with civilian government agencies, which are then required to automatically give that information to national security agencies like the NSA, FBI and the Department of Defense. In fact, this bill was written so broadly that information like your internet activity and even your identity could be shared just because your computer, unbeknownst to you, contained a virus used by hackers. Through no fault of your own, your private information could end up in a government database. There’s no probable cause for the government to obtain that information, they just get it.\n\nSecond, this bill would allow the federal government to turn around and use the information shared by private companies for reasons other than cybersecurity purposes – even though the bill is called the Protecting Cyber Networks Act. For example, the government could use the shared information to investigate and prosecute people for things that have nothing to do with cybersecurity, like assaults and robberies. And to make things worse, the information shared can be sent to state and local governments for their use in fighting local crimes like possession or use of firearms and arson. The whole purpose of this bill is to strengthen cybersecurity, but by allowing law enforcement access to the information for other reasons gets around the search warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The NSA should not be able to tell the Charleston PD that you broke a car window…can you say Big Brother?\n\nThird, I’m not the only one who has problems with the bill: many of the private companies that this bill is incentivizing to share information with the government don’t even think it’s necessary! Top security engineers at Amazon, Cisco and Twitter all agree that this bill creates new legal authorities that aren’t needed. Despite this, the bill goes even further by granting companies liability protections when sharing your information with the government. This is done by raising the standard someone has to meet to show that a business purposefully violated their privacy rights. People should have a reasonable recourse when they are harmed by companies sharing their information, but this bill makes pursuing that recourse much more difficult. \n\nThere are those saying that this bill is more cyber-surveillance than cybersecurity, and I’m inclined to agree with them.	361718620704592
118387985037658	Today, I voted in favor of the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015, which passed the House by a vote of 270 to 179. The bill eliminates the 40% estate tax on inherited assets, commonly referred to as the death tax. Allow me to offer a few reasons for why I supported this bill.\n\nFirst, I don’t believe in double taxation. The beauty of a FAIR tax or Flat tax is not only the compliance that comes with simplicity in a tax code like this, but also the inherent equity that most people recognize in taxing an item or activity once. The American tax system heavily taxes us throughout our lives on the income we earn and the money that we save. It also straddles businesses with the heaviest corporate tax in the world. The Death Tax strikes me as something like those crazy “Survivor” shows that have a participant make it through all sorts of obstacles, only to be knocked aside at the very end. In this case you make your way through the jungle of all these taxes over the course of your life and manage to heroically save and build something…only to have about half of it taken by the federal government.  \n\nSecond, we are in a global race for capital formation and accordingly we should be wary of any tax that discourages investment. By threatening to take essentially half of what many save, the Death Tax sends a signal that it is better to spend today than invest…and that’s not a message that can help the American civilization and its people. Savings drives investment which drives productivity gain which in turn drives standard of living. If we want Americans to enjoy a higher standard of living, we indeed need to focus on capital formation. The Death Tax works in the opposite direction. \n\nThird, we should be wary of low-return, high-cost categories in our tax code. The Death Tax collects a relatively small amount, but in relative terms costs a lot to administer. In fact at $20 billion, the death tax only covers only 55 hours’ worth of the federal government’s operations each year. \n\nFourth, we should kill off parts of the tax code that create inequity within even the class of people who pay it. Too often the tax paid for the same taxable estate is different not because of code, but the caliber of the legal and accounting teams assembled and this is hardly the kind of thing that leads people to trust in the “system” being fair in America. For that matter do we really want legal talent going to the creation of things like a grantor lead trust, rather than things that might make our society more competitive than others around the world? In whatever the case, the Congressional Budget Office recently found that tax loopholes will cost the American taxpayers more than $1.3 trillion over the next ten years and things like the Death Tax only add to this burden. \n\nThe House had not voted on repealing the Death Tax in a decade, and it won’t go far from here.  Its future is uncertain in the Senate, and the President has already threatened to veto the bill should it reach his desk. But I think the spotlight needs to be on tax provisions like the Death Tax given their cost to all of us...with and without estates.	359622607580860
118387985037658	Are you pissed off yet?\n\nIf today isn’t the day that serves as a reminder of the ways in which we spend too much of our lives working for government, I am not sure what is.\n\nDid you know that the average American will spend about 20 years of their lives working for government? I am not talking civil servants or government employees …but you and me!\n\nI remember reading long ago a book by the name of For Good and Evil: The impact of taxes on the course of Civilization, and it got my blood boiling way back then. Now that I have seen government up close, I am all the more bothered as this reminder day rolls around each year. I would recommend the book because it walks through ancient civilizations to ours and examines the ways in which the common man has too often been slave to the tax collector. Its author, Charles Adams, notes “that how we tax and spend determines to a great degree whether we are prosperous or poor, free or enslaved, and most important, good or evil.” I’ll let you read the book to see what he means in the last point, but his larger thesis is an important reminder of how significant today really is as a reminder of government’s weight in each of our lives.\n\nIn fact, Benjamin Franklin once said that the only things certain in this world were death and taxes. True, but based on Adams book, there has been a great disparity over the ages on how much a civilization would ask their citizens to carry. In every instance, when the load became too heavy, there was eventual revolt. As you may know, the individual income tax didn’t come our way until the the time of the Civil War, and even then it was only to be a temporary measure. The Sixteenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, made it possible for the federal government to tax individuals directly …and accordingly we now “celebrate” April 15th.\n\nFour quick thoughts on today:\n\nWhen the federal income tax was first instituted in 1913, the regulations were 400 pages long …that number has grown to 74,608 pages. There are an amazing number of stupid, redundant or overly complex forms to be filled out in keeping the IRS happy that reflect a now amazingly complex maze and labyrinth of code.  \n\nOur tax code has grown more and more progressive with time - which in simple form is to say that the harder you work and the more successful you become, the more our tax code will penalize you.\n\nWe are looking at still more and new taxes …anyone notice the new fees associated with the Affordable Care Act?  \n\nFinally, anyone know what a deficit is? It’s nothing more than a deferred tax. Think about that for a moment. As if we were not paying enough already, we are going to hand to our children an extra $500,000,000,000 in taxes …just from this year alone!\n\nI will have more thoughts on all this, but for now …happy tax day.	359220540954400
118387985037658	I believe the unfathomable and unconscionable killing of Walter Scott, captured on video for all four of his children to see, should be met with real consequence and a thorough review. In the past year, we have witnessed communities torn apart by police-involved deaths from Ferguson to New York City, and now such a tragedy has struck right here at home. We cannot let the actions of one officer cast a shadow on every man and woman who wears a badge, particularly when I believe they overwhelmingly serve our community honorably in all sorts of very trying settings and circumstances. My prayers are with the family and friends of Walter Scott and all affected in this tragedy.	356433124566475

He was known by all to be a man of God, a man of honor, and a man of strong beliefs. His voice will be missed. I was honored to host him and his fine family several years ago on a tour of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nI am confident in the leadership of Mayor Joe Riley that his proven love for the people of Charleston will prevail as Charlestonians unite in prayer. I am grateful for Chief Greg Mullen, the State Law Enforcement Division, and pray for the suspect to be apprehended swiftly.	10153613398084415

118387985037658	Did you know that the Highway Trust Fund, the account that pays for our nation’s roads and bridges out of the federal gas tax you pay at the pump, will run out of money by the end of next month? While different long-term proposals are being discussed, it is more likely we will see another short-term “patch” pushed through, and the can will get kicked down the road again. \n \nLast week, the President released a plan for six years of highway funding by imposing a one-time tax on overseas companies - like Boeing. Instead of increasing the gas tax, which is directly tied to the trust fund, he has proposed raising yet another tax. This makes no more sense than raising the gas tax because the real problem is that there are other non-contributing programs pulling money from gas tax revenue. \n \nThe White House’s proposal would provide funding for a few years, but it doesn’t make any fundamental changes. It merely creates a situation six years later where it will be even harder to provide a solution: cars are only getting more fuel efficient, and the 18.4 cents you pay for each gallon of gas will hold less value. The root of the issue, which is how money is spent within the Highway Trust Fund, is not addressed by the President’s plan.\n\nLast month, I introduced a bill called the Highway Restoration Act of 2015, H.R. 1551, which would address the real problem by reforming the current spending in our infrastructure programs before we look for new taxes. Basic accounting dictates you don’t spend more than you take in, but that is exactly what the trust fund has been doing and why it’s going broke, requiring $65 billion to bail it out since 2008. The Highway Restoration Act allows more of your gas tax money to go to roads, which is what it was intended to do, reducing the fund’s $16 billion annual deficit by more than half.\n \nI will be pushing solutions like this as Congress tackles this issue in the coming days. I’m asking for your support and feedback as I do so - please let me know what you think!	355929411283513

118387985037658	Yesterday, the House passed the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 by a vote of 392 to 37. This bill eliminates the “sustainable growth rate,” which was put into place in 1997 as what Congress hoped would be a fair way to increase payments to doctors in a steady, graduated manner. Beginning in 2003, doctors faced significant cuts in their reimbursements, and it became clear that the sustainable growth rate wasn’t working as intended. Because the doctors’ payment formula was never intended to be punitive, since 2003 Congress has passed 17 bills, known as “doc fixes,” to make sure that doctors’ payments weren’t cut. \n\nAs this was done, these “doc fixes” were paid for with spending cuts or entitlement reforms, but the bill that we voted on yesterday was not. When a bill is not “paid for,” it means its costs go straight to the deficit and get added to the national debt. This left me struggling between coming up with a fair and consistent way to pay doctors while also doing right by the taxpayers. More precisely, the bill Congress passed yesterday only pays for one third of the cost of repealing the sustainable growth rate formula, meaning the rest will be borrowed and indeed added to the tab of our national debt. Despite a number of conversations with friends in the medical community who made the very reasonable point on the need for predictability with regard to the “sustainable growth rate,” I ultimately felt compelled to vote against the bill given its impact on the national debt, so let me further explain.\n\nThis bill authorizes $210 billion in new federal spending over the next ten years while leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay for $141 billion of it. While some have argued that this plan would see real savings twenty years from now, the Congressional Budget Office disagrees and insists that passing the bill into law would end up costing more than keeping with the current formula and its accompanying "doc fixes.” With the federal government on track to have a $470 billion deficit this year alone, the issue of paid for or not is anything but academic. In fact, passing a bill that has offsets which won’t even be seen until ten or twenty years from now should give every one of us pause.  \n\nHad we gotten a bill that would have allowed us to come up with more immediate savings, I would have supported it because the doctors really do need to have some level of certainty on what their fee schedule consists of to make reasoned business decisions. This was a deal fashioned between Speaker Boehner and Nancy Pelosi, so alteration was not possible, and given the cost, that issue led me to join the other conservatives who voted as they did.	352617568281364
118387985037658	After months of work, the House Budget Committee passed its budget last week, and it is being debated on the floor tonight. Votes will come tomorrow, but prior to those votes let me offer a few thoughts on what is coming in and what remains of this important debate.\n\nOne, doing nothing is not an option, yet the President’s budget does just that.\n\nIn fact he proposes to make our financial hole deeper as he adds $8 trillion to the national debt, $2.1 trillion in new taxes, and proposes to run continued deficits such that the budget never actually balances. The republican budget is not perfect, but takes a far different path, as it proposes to cut spending by $5.5 trillion, not raise taxes and balance the budget in less than 10 years.\n\nTwo, stay tuned for further debate on so called “budget caps.”\n\nThey were proposed by the President a few years ago as part of a larger debate on spending as an option so bad that they would never be instituted. Well guess what? They are here. And now the question is how do we deal with them. They are complex because they represent the only piece of spending restraint in Washington and because - for differing reasons - some on both the right and the left of the political debate would like to discard them. Colleagues on the right legitimately argue the caps are hurting the national defense. Yet the catch in this debate is that if you bust them, then the left wants an equal amount of increase in the things they want out of Washington. Accordingly, there will be two Republican budgets offered tomorrow that deal in differing ways with this prickly issue of budget caps.\n\nThree, the budget this year, in whatever its form, is more important than past budgets because this one will not be discarded as they were when Harry Reid ruled the Senate. This is a big deal.\n\nWhen a House and Senate come together on a budget, they create what are called “budget caps” that set in motion what is then called “regular order.” In Washington, this then allows for the yearly debate of the different categories of government expenditure that were absent in years past when House and Senate could not come together on a budget. Think of it this way: if a husband and wife could never agree on a family budget, you would have chaos. Imagine a hypothetical couple wherein the wife on any given day would spend whatever she might want on jewelry while the husband would spend whatever he wanted on guns and ammo. A functioning family would instead agree to a budget and set “caps” on different categories, and that would allow for a “regular order” of the husband, wife, and kids being able to spend within the lines of the family budget. That, in simple terms, is what is at play here in Washington. It’s also for that reason that a colleague of mine said to me the other day, “I would vote for a salami sandwich called a budget if it got us back to regular order with the Senate.” So while it may sound like inside baseball, coming together on a budget is a big deal for all of us who care about how money gets spent in Washington and the efficiency of the government we have. Getting to “regular order” is foundational to both.\n\nMuch more to come on the budget …stay tuned tomorrow …	351814005028387
118387985037658	People talk a lot about equity and fairness in politics, and in fact “lady liberty” in holding the scales of justice wears a blindfold representing the fact that the law should favor no one and instead apply equally to all. In upholding this most basic of American tenets, it's vital we all be vigilant against ways in which that simple code is broken …whether with the President in his attempt to bypass the law with amnesty by unilateral executive order - or with things like what occurred this evening on the House floor. \n\nToday we voted on a bill that would allow Hawaii to use federal housing funds to discriminate against anyone who isn’t a native Hawaiian ….so much for equal protection under the law. The bill, titled H.R. 360, Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act of 2015, passed by a vote of 297 to 98, but I voted against it because of how this provision went against the fundamental American notion just described.\n \nThe Declaration of Independence acknowledges the self-evident truth that we are all created equal. This means that laws should be color blind without preference for one group of people because of their skin color, and laws shouldn’t choose who wins and who loses based upon one’s heritage. These themes were important enough for our country to add the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to address discrimination and provide constitutional protection for people regardless of their ethnicity.\n \nDespite this principle, this bill would authorize the Hawaiian government to receive $65 million from the taxpayers to in fact differentiate among neighbors solely based on race—choosing Native Hawaiians over blacks, whites, Hispanics, or any other ethnicity. Two neighbors who live in identical houses and have identical financial situations can be treated differently solely because of their ancestry, one receiving federal assistance, and another receiving nothing. Most I talk to at home do not believe it is constitutional for any particular group to be singled out for preferential treatment, and accordingly, I cast my vote against this bill. Liberty is rarely lost in big steps, but rather by the little steps that erode what the founding fathers worked so hard to create. Tonight’s vote was such a step …seemingly small, but important for its direction.	351516311724823
118387985037658	The National Labor Relations Board has been up to it again …and today’s vote was about trying to slow them down. As most folks well know at home, the National Labor Relations Board went the extra mile a while back in trying to prevent Boeing from adding jobs in Charleston. Unfortunately, their latest activity has been to create a new rule that requires an employer being petitioned by a labor union to turn over their employees' private information …that means their home numbers and more …so that the union can use it as they see fit. This is the “Ambush Election Rule” that was quietly instituted by the NLRB late last year, and not only does it force employers to give employees’ personal information to labor unions without their permission when unions request it, it also ensures that there is little time for anyone to decide what to do when facing a vote on whether to unionize, not to mention negotiate a compromise.\n\nFor the reasons above, today I voted in favor of S.J. Res. 8, which states Congress’ disapproval of the NLRB rule and would prohibit it from going into effect. It passed the House by a vote of 232-186, and since it has already passed the Senate, it’s up to the President to sign it into law. President Obama will undoubtedly veto this measure, and given the votes are not there to override him, it looks like we will be stuck with another bad NLRB rule for the next twenty months – and yet another reason the Presidential race will be so important next year.	350064688536652
118387985037658	Unfortunately, personal experience is typically how most people come to appreciate trauma center services, whether as a victim or through the committed professionals who do this vital work every day. As a result, operating and supporting those centers can be an incredibly emotional issue, but we have to balance that against the financial realities in Washington. That’s the situation that the House faced last night on two votes related to trauma center funding, H.R. 647, the Access to Life-Saving Trauma Care for All Americans Act, and H.R. 648, the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act. The bills passed by votes of 389 to 10 and 382 to 15, respectively, but after careful thought, I cast my votes against these two bills.\n\nI did so in part because of process. These issues were brought up as what are called “suspensions,” and after voice votes at the committee level their “suspension” status meant they received essentially no debate on the House floor. Regardless of the merit of any topic, and trauma centers clearly have real merit, I believe we should debate any new expenditure that involves hundreds of millions in new taxpayer commitments.\n\nTogether, these bills would authorize $626 million in spending over the next five years on a variety of grants that would go to states to improve trauma care. H.R. 647 would authorize two grant proposals for $100 million per year for five years, the Trauma Center Care Grants and Trauma Service Availability Grants. These grants were created by the Affordable Care Act in 2011 but have never been funded. H.R. 648 would provide $25 million per year for the next five years in other grant funding for development of trauma centers and pilot programs for regional trauma care efforts. These programs have not been funded since 2005.\n\nIf the proposed legislation currently made the difference between having good trauma centers or not in South Carolina, it might have made more sense to support these grants, but that’s not the case. The Medical University of South Carolina hospital system does not receive any federal funding for its trauma center, and yet it has received the highest national recognition for trauma centers through the American College of Surgeons (ACS). Of note, these results have been achieved without any federal government spending in this area since 2005.\n\nMore is always seen as better when it comes to funding any service, and in that regard a new federal grant program would undoubtedly help Trauma centers around the country …but the question is at what cost? Given that good results in trauma care have been achieved without additional federal dollars to date, I believed that question needed to be debated and accordingly voted as I did. So though well-intentioned, and despite the heroic work done on a daily basis at our center in Charleston, adding $626 million in new spending while the federal government is already a half trillion in the red this year did indeed deserve a debate it never got last night.	349347935274994

70150469414	Today, I was proud to vote in support of H.R. 596, a bill I cosponsored to repeal Obamacare in its entirety and put in motion efforts to implement a commonsense alternative to the President’s broken healthcare law. Obamacare has stifled job creation through burdensome regulations on small businesses and has raised the price of insurance premiums on American families, all while millions of hardworking Americans have been told they can no longer keep their health insurance plan or their doctor. Today's bill takes a critical step forward to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a commonsense solution that lowers health care premium costs, protects the doctor-patient relationship, and eliminates duplicative government programs and wasteful spending.	10153237645684415
70150469414	With a national debt reaching over $18 trillion and an economy defined by stagnant wages and weak economic growth, many Americans hoped that in his speech tonight, President Obama would reassure us he would work with Congress to grow our economy, create jobs, and get our nation on a path to prosperity. Sadly, we heard more rhetoric highlighting the President’s continued refusal to work with Congress and instead, promote his own agenda – an agenda that includes policies a majority of Americans oppose that raise taxes and destroy jobs.\n\nTonight, the President made it clear that he supports tax increases that destroy jobs and discourage America’s small businesses from hiring. The Administration’s policies have failed to raise wages – in fact, during his Administration, per capita income is down nearly $3,000 per family. His policies also have caused a shift towards many Americans settling for part-time jobs or giving up the job search entirely. In December 2014, the labor force participation rate fell to its lowest point in over 30 years. This is not an economic recovery to be celebrating, and the American people deserve better.\n\nHouse Republicans have passed bipartisan, pro-growth bills to create American jobs. We’ve passed bills to utilize our nation’s abundant energy resources to grow our economy and lower energy costs, scale back excessive and burdensome regulations to enable small businesses to hire workers, and cut wasteful federal spending to ensure our massive debt is not passed on to our children and grandchildren. Yet, the President ignores our proposals or threatens to veto them.\n\nIt is my hope that President Obama will decide to work with Congress on all fronts to empower the lives of Americans. It is bold to say that the State of the Union is strong when 8.7 million Americans are out of work. Now is the time for a productive approach that will really bolster middle-class Americans, help them keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, and grow high-paying American jobs from the ground-up.	10153205027594415

70150469414	I am grateful to have had a lifetime of working with Doctor Jim Edwards, and the honor of knowing his wife Anne, daughter Cathy, and son Jim. Doctor Edwards was a tireless stalwart for conservative limited government to expand freedom. In high school, I would visit his dental office for Goldwater materials, in his capacity as Charleston County Republican Chairman. In 1974, he courageously ran and was elected as South Carolina’s first Republican Governor. At that time, I worked with him on the State Development Board, where he recruited Michelin Tire Corporation to produce job opportunities for our citizens. I was honored to serve him in the visionary Reagan Administration as Deputy General Counsel as he achieved success in deregulation as Secretary of Energy.\n\nHis return to Charleston as President of the Medical University of South Carolina resulted in MUSC becoming recognized for world-class universities. South Carolina has lost a southern gentlemen, devoted dad and grandfather, who has made a difference as a key architect for a political revolution.\n\nDoctor Edwards will be deeply missed, and Roxanne and my thoughts and prayers are with his family.	10153107156944415

70150469414	Before we head home to spend time with constituents, House Republicans have made it clear that - first and foremost - we care about job creation. The House just added two more pieces of legislation our collection.  Included in today’s bills are provisions to ensure production of the Keystone Pipeline and lower gas prices so that families can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.  High unemployment and increased consumer prices are becoming the new status quo because of the President’s failed economic policies. House Republicans have  solutions and it’s time for the Senate to bring the 40+ bills up for a vote instead of leaving them in the Senate graveyard.	10152848010434415
70150469414	Every President issues executive orders as a way to assist with implementation of a law. However, I believe President Obama has taken his authority too far.  Moments ago, the House voted to file a lawsuit against the President because of executive orders he signed that unilaterally changed Obamacare's employer mandate without authorization from Congress.  House Republicans are committed to upholding the Constitution and President Obama has not faithfully executed the laws which we have passed.	10152711513514415
70150469414	This afternoon, Acting VA Secretary Gibson visited the William Jennings Dorn VA Hospital in Columbia, SC. He plans to meet with officials at the Charlie Norwood VA Hospital in Augusta, GA, tomorrow morning.  Although I have faith in the local administrations at both facilities, our veterans are facing significant challenges when seeking medical care. I am very grateful that the Administration is finally making progress to address the inexcusable mismanagement that has plagued our system for years. As the former President and CEO of the United Services Organizations (USO), Acting Secretary Gibson has the experience and credentials to make a difference and restore accountability with our veterans.  Moving forward, I will continue to closely monitor the situations at Dorn and Charlie Norwood VA hospitals to ensure those who have fought for our freedom receive the health care services they deserve and have earned.	10152659908899415
70150469414	As I continue to closely monitor the situation at the Williams Jennings Dorn VA Medical in Columbia, South Carolina, and Charlie Norwood VA Medical in Augusta, Georgia, I want to be sure that our veterans are truly receiving adequate care.  To accomplish this, I want to hear from you. Whether you’re a healthcare professional or patient living in South Carolina's Second Congressional District, please tell your story about how you or someone you know has been impacted by the VA’s mismanagement by visiting  http://joewilson.house.gov/shareyourVAstory. Your input will help restore accountability with veterans by helping to determine and correct problems within the system.	10152639378574415

70150469414	The mismanagement and lack of care our veterans are receiving from the Veterans Affairs Department is a disservice to our Nation. Resolving these issues affecting thousands of those who have answered the call of duty to keep our families safe should be a top priority. The President’s disingenuous comments earlier today show that this Administration is not willing to do what it takes to fix the growing problem. Waiting for a bureaucratic report’s findings delays progress and does nothing to quickly address the severe backlogs and denial of services our veterans are facing each day.\n\nhttp://joewilson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=380781	10152532413594415
70150469414	Last night, Energy Secretary Moniz announced a revised decision which no longer places MOX in a "cold standby."  This is only possible because the people of South Carolina have made their voices heard. Deciding to no longer place MOX in cold standby saves thousands of jobs and honors commitments made to hardworking employees at the Savannah River Site.	10152481584504415
70150469414	After spending time with constituents in South Carolina, I'm back in DC to address the major concerns you all have shared with me over the past two weeks.

What other issues are important to you?	10152478941419415
187268144624279	There are no words strong enough to describe the devastating crime that took place in Charleston last night. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims, particularly the family of Senator Pinckney, a former colleague of mine and the pastor for the church that was attacked. I will always remember Senator Pinckney as a soft spoken gentleman who deeply cared for others.\n\nThese brutal murders are the rare kind of horror that shakes at our very core. This devastating event will be on our minds for sometime to come. I ask that you join me in praying for Charleston. Our brothers and sisters in Christ taken from us last night clearly believed in the power of prayer. They were praying and so should we. We are all children of God.	1016393661711719

187268144624279	Interesting development on the House floor this afternoon. There were three votes scheduled for today, two of which had to pass in order for the TPA legislation to be sent to the President. Leadership had hoped that by dividing the question into three parts that they may be more likely to pass the final bill. The first vote was on Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). TAA is essentially a bailout for organized labor. The program gives unions millions of taxpayer dollars to offset economic disturbances caused by trade agreements. Despite aggressive lobbying from the President and a personal visit to Capitol Hill this morning, TAA was rejected by a stunning vote of 126-302 (I voted no). This was a pretty big blow to our lame duck President.\n \nHouse Leadership's plan had been that if any of the votes had failed, the measure would be stopped. However, after TAA was rejected the Majority Leader called for an immediate vote on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA or Fast-Track). The TPA vote passed on a close vote of 219-211 (I voted no). This was very disappointing, but GOP Leadership and the President were able to convince just enough Democrats to support the measure. The Speaker then made an immediate motion to reconsider the TAA vote, and then immediately postponed the roll call vote until sometime early next week.\n \nSo where do we stand? TAA was added to TPA in order to appease Harry Reid and Senate Democrats in order to get the necessary votes for Senate passage of TPA. Without TAA, the likelihood of TPA passing the Senate is slim to none.\n \nThe failure to pass TAA now puts TPA’s final passage in serious jeopardy. The President will be working all weekend to get Democrats on board, and Speaker Boehner will be working on the 109 Republicans who voted Yes on TPA but No on TAA. Including Speaker Boehner, 90 Members will need to switch from No to Yes on TAA for TPA to become law.\n \nI remain opposed to TPA for all of the reasons I have previously stated. I don’t trust giving more power to this President. Preventing Congress from amending or filibustering a trade agreement limits legislative authority. I also don’t think it’s appropriate to fast-track a classified trade agreement that the public isn’t able to see. I understand that the agreement will be publicly available prior to a final vote, but why are we being asked to give up power to the President so we can vote on a trade agreement that the public has not been able to comment on? This is simply not transparent.\n \nI will continue to keep you updated on the developments, and please continue to send me your feedback.	1013506908667061
187268144624279	Late this afternoon the House held a procedural vote on TPA, the first true test vote for the legislation. Rule votes are normally fairly routine. The party in power votes for the rule and the minority party votes against them. Most Members of Congress will spend their entire tenure in Congress never voting against their party on a rule vote. After today, I will not be one of those Congressmen.\n\nTPA and TPP concern me. I have problems with us passing legislation that fast-tracks a future trade agreement that is kept from the public and is currently only available to Congress in an unfinished form. Not only is it bad enough that I can't solicit feedback from the public, but I'm being asked to trust that President Obama is going to keep his word and not make major changes in this agreement that could have severe impacts on our laws and our way of life.\n\nToday, I joined with several of my colleagues in voting against the rule for the bill. We actually were only two votes away from stopping the rule vote from passing, and only lost because GOP leadership were able to convince a handful of Democrats to switch sides at the last second.\n\nThere are dozens of reasons why I opposed the rule. For starters, we're taking up the Senate passed TPA bill. The Senate bill raises revenue. According to the Constitution, revenue raising bills must originate in the House. But the rule vote prohibits House Members from making a point of order to stop the legislation. The rule also prohibits us from objecting to the budget gimmickry and procedural games filled within the language of TPA. For example, in one section of the bill it makes changes to a government program to save tax dollars in order to offset to spending in another area and make the overall legislation budget neutral. However, a separate section repeals the change, but leaves the new spending on the books. This is just dishonest, no matter how you look at it and contributes to the reason people simply don't trust Washington.\n\nI've heard the arguments for TPA. "This gives Congress more negotiating power." "Fast-track can be turned off if we don't like the agreement that the President gives us." These are both true, if we believe that Republican Leadership is going to fight harder for a good trade deal than they have against the President's unlawful executive actions. These are also true if we trust President Obama to follow a "gentleman's agreement" as I've heard it called, even though he won't follow the Constitution.\n\nI don't trust Washington to get this right, and that is why I took the extraordinary step of voting against the rule. I plan on continuing my opposition against the final passage of TPA.	1013060372045048

187268144624279	Today, we're voting on H.R. 2393, a bill that eliminates country of origin labeling for meat products sold in the United States. There's a troubling reason why this bill is being brought up for a vote. A recent World Trade Organization ruling found that the country of origin labeling of meat products is a violation of trade rules and if we do not change US law our farmers will be hit with a 20% tariff if they attempt to sell their products overseas. This puts our farmers in a tough spot, and is an important reminder of why we must be ever vigilant in protecting American sovereignty.\n\nA few hours ago we received a notice that the House will be voting on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) (fast-track authority for trade deals) this week. There's been a lot of confusion related to TPA and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but the language for TPA is unclassified and available online. However, I am opposed to TPA in its current form because it fast-tracks TPP (the largest trade agreement in US history, even though the final TPP language has yet to be finalized and is classified from the public). I don't think Congress should prevent itself from being able to amend legislation that the public has yet to have a chance to read.\n\nWithout divulging any classified information on TPP, there's been a lot of information posted online about international governance issues included in the trade agreement. This should be a concern for all of us. If you're not concerned, you need only look at the country of origin legislation that we'll be voting on this afternoon.	1011545395529879

187268144624279	The Affordable Care Act, affectionately known as Obamacare, was passed by Congress using a procedural move known as budget reconciliation.\n\nNow, the Senate parliamentarian will ultimately rule what can and cannot be repealed through reconciliation.\n\nIf something can be passed into law via "Budget reconciliation" - surely it can be taken out of law via the same process.\n\nThe ACA was less about making systemic changes to healthcare delivery and more about who was going to pay for it (healthcare for those without access to insurance) and how. Now we are witnessing the bankruptcy of several state exchanges.\n\nIt is time to return to the drawing board, get the government OUT of the middle of healthcare decisions which should be between a patient and their doctor, revisit EMTALA and over-utilization of the expensive emergency room for primary care, look into Community Care Centers as a possible model for delivery of healthcare for those without access to insurance.\n\nWhen government pays for something, it will demand more control. We have also seen how inept government is in creating websites for Obamacare and cash for clunkers.\n\nIt is time to get government back to a limited, Constitutional size and role.	1005729129444839

187268144624279	Out and about in the sunny Third District today. Spent the morning in Ridge Springs visiting with the great folks at South Carolina's largest peach producer, Titan Farms. They were unveiling their brand new state of the art peach packing line and facility upgrade. A great operation and another example of South Carolina being the best place to do, and grow, business!!\n\nI will be making stops in Pendleton and Seneca later on today.\n\nYesterday I talked to a clever bunch of 3rd grade students at Nevitt Forest Community School of Innovation. I can tell they are being carefully taught by fantastic teachers, and will grow into great members of our community. Our children will solve the problems of tomorrow. I see a lot of promise for America being nurtured in our community already.\n\nI also was fortunate to attend the Anderson Regional Airshow as they honored the Korean War Vets and commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Still fitting for their service is a quote I am reminded of by Winston Churchill. While in the darkest moments of Britain's struggle during that war, as another squadron of Spitfires was taking off to meet one of the unrelenting waves of Nazi fighters, he said, "Never was so much owed by so many, to so few."	1003612269656525

187268144624279	Yesterday I received a LOT of great feedback from my post on the EPA's final rule what is commonly known as "Waters of the United States". People want to know what we can do about it, and as a legislator, I believe we must do everything we can within our constitutional limits in Congress to prevent this rule. But what about other rules that come up breaking the separation of powers in the Constitution? \n\nAccording to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, federal regulations cost the economy $1.88 trillion dollars in 2014. Yes. That is $1.88 trillion out of your pockets; from regulations that were not passed by Congress. This really is incredible. No wonder the economy is moving slower than a drunk slug. \n\nSo what can we do about this? One fix which would be government wide is the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2015 introduced by Rep. Todd Young of Indiana. I am proud to be an original cosponsor. The bill requires Congressional approval for any regulation with an annual economic impact of $100M or more. This is just the start, but an important one to begin the people's fight back against a power hungry administrative state.	1003591996325219

187268144624279	One of the things I really like about Facebook is its ability to allow us to have a constant dialogue on the issues. Not everyone is going to agree with me 100% of the time and I totally understand and expect that. But I do want to make sure you know where I'm coming from and I certainly need to hear from you when we do disagree. I received the following response from a constituent regarding my last post. I'm going to go through this person's message section by section and respond. No talking points, just a civil political/philosophical discussion on why I take the positions that I do. If you disagree with me, LET ME KNOW! If you agree with me, let me know that as well. But let's keep it civil and hopefully use this as an opportunity learn from one another and gain a stronger understanding of each others positions:\n\nConstituent: "The president's utilization of the executive order is neither 'abuse of power' nor unprecedented."\n\nMe: I'm not saying the President doesn't have the power to issue certain types of executive orders. As chief executive, the President has the power to make certain decisions on his or her own. If a President wants to make a proclamation or decide what color to paint a building that is in their power to do so. I also freely acknowledge that President Obama has actually issued fewer executive orders than some of his predecessors. But as I have said before, it's not the number of executive orders that concern me as much as it is the nature of them. The problem comes when President's legislate on their own. Take the executive amnesty issue as an example. The President is declaring that an entire group of people are lawfully present in the United States. These are millions of people who will qualify for various benefits that you the taxpayer must pay for. This is not a power that belongs to the President of the United States. Using the same logic, a Republican President who wanted to eliminate the capital gains tax could bypass Congress order the IRS not to investigate anyone for failing to pay those taxes. If that were to happen, liberals would go ballistic and rightfully so! But that's exactly what this President is doing in regards to immigration and a host of other issues. We need to let the constitution be our guide on this issue. \n\nConstituent: "Why are you so concerned about Obama's credibility or place in posterity? It seems to me your focus should be on what you can do to improve the lives of your constituents, citizens of one of the poorest and most poorly educated states in our country."\n\nMe: I'm not concerned about President Obama's place in posterity, but I am concerned with the bad precedents he's setting. Take President Obama's illegal recess appointments for example. President Obama appointed several people to the NLRB (the entity that tried to stop Boeing from coming to SC) and the CFPB under the recess appointment power even though Congress wasn't in recess. The case took a few years to be resolved but the Supreme Court issued a rare 9-0 decision against the President saying those appointments were unconstitutional. When the President doesn't follow the law, we as Americans lose some of our freedom. Freedom doesn't see race, age, gender, or income. But we all lose some of it when our elected officials don't follow the rule of law. Regarding improving the lives of the people of South Carolina, that's on my mind every day. We just have very different perspectives on how to achieve that goal. I don't think borrowing money from China to fund a new government program is the best way to lift someone out of poverty or help them find a job. I believe in eliminating the barriers that make it difficult for someone to start their own business and get ahead. I believe in empowering individuals to make the decisions that best fit their needs instead of having someone in Washington tell them what to do. Same is true for states, we need to get Washington out of the way. For example, a new study from the Heritage Foundation shows that the new proposed EPA carbon rule will cost South Carolinians over 10,000 manufacturing jobs by the year 2023. This will have a massive impact on our state, but President Obama thinks that he alone can make that decision without Congress? That's not the system that our Founding Fathers created and that the citizens of our country consented to.\n\nConstituent: "I can't excuse paid employees of our government embarking on fool's errands like taking the time to draft, discuss, and ultimately push through bills that have no chance of surviving the veto pen. I hope you can see that this kind of tomfoolery is exasperating to the people you have been elected to represent and who pay your salary. You, along with many of your republican counterparts, have wasted entirely too much time, effort, and resources digging your heels in to oppose the president. Frankly, this kind of behavior seems quite childish and is unbecoming for someone in your position."\n\nMe: Let's just flip your argument around for a second. Do you think President Obama should not be taking time to fly around the country giving policy speeches on issues that this Congress fundamentally disagrees with him on and will never pass? When I fly somewhere, I fly coach on a commercial airliner. When the President flies somewhere, it's a lot more expensive. I just bring this up because I've heard your point before, but I never hear it used on the President. We have three equal branches of government. Our Founding Fathers never intended for the President to be the only one who speaks his mind or that Congress is only allowed to take up legislation if we have a green light from someone over at the White House. We're going to disagree, that's America. If the President didn't want Republicans to spend so much time repealing ObamaCare, then he could have done what every other American President has done and that is work across the aisle to gain bipartisan support on an issue. If George W. Bush could work with Ted Kennedy, surely Barack Obama could have worked with John McCain or Susan Collins. And back to my previous points, if you fundamentally believe like I and millions of Americans do that the President is breaking the law, you don't simply shrug it off, you do something to stop it. If I believe that the President is breaking the law, and I'm not doing everything I can to stop him then I'm not upholding my oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. I know you probably won't agree with me on that point, but that's genuinely how I feel.\n\nConstituent: "Lastly, I would ask you to remember that you have been elected to represent ALL the people in your district. Not all of us are republicans, and not all of us voted for you. Nevertheless, it is your job to listen to us and take our thoughts into consideration when you make decisions in your official capacity."\n\nMe: I agree, and I try to do my best to represent all constituents. If you call my office asking for help with the VA or a Social Security issue, I don't ask whether you're a Republican or how you voted for President. But when it comes to me voting on the floor of the House, someone's always going to be unhappy. If an abortion bill comes to the floor, I have the choice between voting for the pro-life position or for the pro-choice position. But what I do to try to represent all constituents is that I try to follow the constitution and listen to the people back home. I've always said that I'm a Christian, conservative, Republican in that order. If you look at my voting record in Washington, I don't blindly follow the GOP leadership. I think I made that pretty clear when I voted against John Boehner for Speaker. I've also made that clear recently for my vote against the Patriot Act extension and when I voiced my opposition to TPA. I'm conservative, I don't hide that at all. But I will always put the constitution and the people of South Carolina ahead of partisanship and I hope I've shown that with my record. And I am very glad you took the time to write in. I really do read these posts, and regardless of whether we end up agreeing at the end, I strongly believe I'm a better representative when I know how you feel on a given issue.\n\n Anyway, that might be a new persona record for the longest post. But I hope it was useful. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts.	1000615473289538
187268144624279	"A new poll released this week shows that 75% of Republicans want GOP leaders to challenge Obama more often; just 15% say they are handling relations with the president about right and 7% say GOP leaders should go along with Obama more often."\n\nPut me in the camp with the 75%. Americans want leaders who are willing to be bold. The House and Senate should be focused on passing bills that massively reduce the role of the federal government in our lives which in turn empowers individuals to create jobs and innovate. We should be slashing spending for programs that are not in the federal purview, and enact major reforms that stop unprecedented abuse of power from the Executive Branch. Have we done some of this? Sure. But often times we're nibbling around the edges instead of taking a bite out of the problem. We know President Obama will veto most of it, but at least we can say we tried and put us on record as having bold solutions to address our country's problems. The more legislation we send to the President's desk, the less credibility he'll have when we come to an impasse on spending and he tries to blame Republicans for "shutting down the government."\n\nI'm far from alone in this thinking, I know over half the Republicans in Congress agree with me. It's the other half and most Democrats that need to get with the program! They need to hear from you!	1000453969972355

187268144624279	Yesterday, I voted against the USA Freedom Act which made some reforms to the NSA's data collection program and renewed provisions of the Patriot Act. While the bill contained some positive changes to existing law, I voted no because the legislation simply didn't go far enough in protecting our liberty.	994232243927861
187268144624279	There's been much discussion throughout the state lately about the condition of our roads and bridges and what to do about them. What if I were to tell you there's a way we could reduce the costs of nearly all major infrastructure projects by 10-15%? Well there is a way and it's actually fairly simple. The Davis-Bacon Act requires that all construction projects involving federal dollars pay their employees the prevailing union wage. If we were to simply remove that requirement and allow the free-market to set these wages, we would significantly reduce the cost of federally supported construction projects. We voted on an amendment recently to change the Davis-Bacon laws in this country. Imagine what we could do if we had 10-15% more funds to spend on infrastructure projects without needing to raise taxes or increase our debt. Here's a look at how Congress voted:\n\nhttp://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll191.xml	993718140645938

188649667827713	It’s truly a sad day in South Carolina. The shooting in Charleston that took the lives of nine people has shaken that community and the state as a whole.  It's also touched me personally, as I sat next to Senator Clementa Pinckney for two years in Columbia.  He was a kind and gentle man. My prayers are with his family as well as with the families of those who were lost.  I hope you’ll join me in keeping the victims, their families, and the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in your thoughts and prayers.	1176778245681512

188649667827713	Quick update on the Trade Promotion Authority Bill (TPA):  as I mentioned in yesterday’s post, I lead the effort by the House Freedom Caucus to amend the TPA bill in order to give Congress more involvement and oversight in future trade negotiation processes. In summary:  we thought all Members of Congress should have some say in holding the President — any President — accountable in following the trade law.  \n\nApparently my arguments were unpersuasive.  (Either that or the fix was in before the arguments even began…but I’ll let other folks be the judge of that.)  My amendment was not ruled in order and it will not be heard on the floor of the House or given an up-or-down vote.\n\nAnyway, unless something dramatic changes, which at this point I don’t expect, I will be voting no on TPA.	1172428282783175
188649667827713	Today is Memorial Day.  I think sometimes we forget — I know I do — that today isn’t a time to thank veterans for their service, but to remember especially those who died while serving.  It’s a pretty somber holiday, then, if you stop to think about it.  It really doesn’t bother me that Memorial Day has turned into a long-weekend and the unofficial beginning of summer: after all, any excuse to go spend time with your family should be a welcome thing.  But as you get together for however you spend today, I hope you will keep in your thoughts Staff Sergeant T.J. Dudley of Tega Cay, who died in Afghanistan in 2011 while serving his 6th tour of duty.  And remember that his family made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, and that they won’t be able to do — as a family — the things that we are able to.\n\nThat would be a nice way to celebrate the day, it seems.\n\nThank you to Staff Sergeant Dudley and to all of those who gave their lives for our country.  And especially to their families.	1158764957482841

188649667827713	My amendment to shut down the abuse of the War Budget failed last night.  It ended up about 20 votes short, and I will admit that is pretty disappointing.  What is just as disappointing, however, is that only 29 Republicans supported the effort.\n \nIn talking with a lot of my colleagues, it seems that their reasoning for voting against my amendment was pretty consistent:  "Yes, we know this isn't war-related, and yes, it shouldn't be in the OCO budget, and yes, the OCO Budget is a terrible way to spend money.  BUT, we really really need this fuel depot in Djibouti, and this is the only way we can get it."  \n \nMy interpretation:  We need it.  Very badly.  Badly enough to use gimmicks and slush funds.  But not badly enough to pay for it.  \n \nIn the greater scheme of things, my amendment was practically nothing.  It represented, after all, only  8/100ths of one percent of the defense budget. But symbolically it offers a pretty good insight into how Washington works.\n\nIf you have ever seen me speak in person at our Town Halls, or participated in our FBQ&As, you have heard me say this 100 times:  our nation's debt isn't the fault of one political party...it takes BOTH parties to get the country 18 trillion in debt.  That was on full display last night.\n \nAnyway, if you are curious, here are the 28 GOPers who voted with me.  \n \nAmash\nBrooks (AL)\nBurgess\nCollins (GA)\nDesJarlais\nDuncan (TN)\nGarrett\nGohmert\nGosar\nGriffith\nHuelskamp\nJones\nJordan\nLabrador\nLoudermilk\nLummis\nMassie\nMcClintock\nPerry\nRohrabacher\nSalmon\nSanford\nSchweikert\nSensenbrenner\nTipton\nWalker\nWoodall\nYoho	1144043025621701

And while that only lasted a day, at least the Yankees lost as well.  So, all is well in the baseball world.  Play ball!!!	1128099610549376
127744320598870	It is with great sadness that I heard of the unspeakable tragedy that occurred in Charleston last night.  My heart goes out to the victims, including Reverend and State Senator Clementa Pinckney, their friends and family and members of Emanuel AME Church.  I am distraught that this kind of hate still exists in our country and specifically in my home state of South Carolina.  I'm reminded of the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., "The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people." We must take these horrific crimes that are happening across our states and teach our neighbors that hate is not the answer.  Please pray with me today for the Charleston community as they begin the healing process.	960133604026600

403403083083104	This morning members of our South Carolina congressional delegation, South Carolina congressional staff, Clemson University President Jim Clements, former Governor David Beasley, state religious leaders, and members of the Palmetto State business community had breakfast together to pray for our state and nation. Sen. Tim Scott hosts this prayer breakfast annually and opened up the meeting by reading Isaiah 61: 1-3:\n\n"The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim the good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives, and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion-- to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oils of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor." \n\nThis scripture guided our conversation and prayers throughout the breakfast. We are blessed to live in a state that does no shy away from Christianity and God's word, which we rely on to guide us in Washington and back at home in our communities. May God continue to bless you, the Palmetto State, and the United States of America.	853975728025835

403403083083104	It is no secret, President Obama and I do not agree on much. In fact, since I have been in Congress I have repeatedly looked for ways to hold the President accountable. I certainly would not support legislation that affords him more power.\n\nThe trade regulation bill we passed today asserts Congressional priorities into trade negotiations and grants Congress the right to take away the President’s trade authority at any time if negotiations become concerning. For the first time, TPA requires the President to make any trade agreement public for 60 days before it can be submitted to Congress for a vote.\n\nThere have been some concerns that the bill allows the President to alter our immigration laws or that Congress is adjudicating its power. Both are simply untrue. This bill explicitly states that trade agreements cannot change immigration laws or obligate the U.S. to grant or expand access to visas. Without TPA, the President can continue to negotiate trade deals behind closed doors without any Congressional oversight. \n\nSouth Carolina is experiencing a resurgence in manufacturing. Our manufacturers need access to the 96 percent of the world’s consumers that live outside of the United States.  Without trade agreements, our manufacturers face substantial barriers selling to consumers in other countries.\n\nMore than half a million South Carolina jobs are tied to trade. I surveyed several of our largest district employers to get their views on TPA. Every employer we spoke to supported trade promotional authority. Some of their opinions are listed below:\n  \n"On behalf of the International Paper employees in your district, many of whom have written to you personally, I urge your support for a trade agenda that will advance the global competitiveness of the U.S. economy. Passing TPA legislation is a priority issue for our company."\n\n"As our Timmonsville-based facility is the sole global production source for Honda all-terrain (ATV) and side-by-side (SxS) vehicles, Honda of South Carolina Mfg., Inc. understands the benefits of rules-based trade and open investment for increasing market-opening opportunities for our U.S.-origin products,” said Brian Newman, President of Honda of South Carolina Mfg., Inc.  "Therefore, we call upon Congress to pass TPA-2015 in order to strengthen the trade deals that the U.S. negotiates to better benefit American workers, American communities, and companies that manufacture in, and export from, the United States."\n\n“TPA is critical to the long-term success of South Carolina’s small, medium, and large globally engaged businesses and farmers in addition to their workers and families. We encourage you to support it,” said Georgia-Pacific in a joint letter to the South Carolina congressional delegation. Georgia-Pacific operates a Dixie Cup plant in Darlington County. \n\nPerdue Farms in Dillon County is a member of the National Chicken Council and annually exports millions of pounds of chicken parts. “It is now more important than ever to expand poultry sales to other world markets,” said National Chicken Council President Mike Brown. “Passage of TPA would help ensure foreign access for U.S. chicken, generate more farm income, jobs in rural districts, and improve the U.S. trade balance.”\n\n“In general, I am in support of Fast Track legislation for the executive branch,” said Timothy Tilley, CEO of Envirosep.  “However, I believe any re-authorization should include Congress's trade policy priorities and objectives, ensure the executive branch adheres to Congressional policies and objectives, and ensure fair trade practices. Any good trade deal is a "win - win" for both sides. Generally, I believe the key benefactors of free trade deals are large corporations, whereas, I would like to see policies that help promote small firms like mine.” \n\n“Farmers here in South Carolina help feed the world through our agriculture exports,” said the SC Farm Bureau President David Winkles. “In 2013, agribusiness was 30 percent of the Port of Charleston’s total container volume. TPA will make South Carolina and America more competitive on the global market by expanding trade and investment opportunities.”\n\n“The Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce supports passage of the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA),” said Brad Dean, President & CEO, Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. “Our businesses generally see TPA as a critical step in renewing America’s leadership on trade and securing new trade agreements that create more opportunities for the middle-class.” \n\n“The business community in South Carolina sees TPA as a critical step in renewing America’s leadership on trade and securing new trade agreements that create more opportunities for the middle-class,” said the North Myrtle Beach Chamber of Commerce. “Passage of this bill is key to increasing this country’s competitiveness and will empower businesses to sell more “Mad the in the USA” products overseas.” \n\nOther South Carolina Employers Calling on Congress to Pass TPA: ABB Inc.; ACS, Inc.; BASF Corporation; Beneteau; Canfor/ New South; Caterpillar; Cummins Inc.; Daimler Trucks North America; Domtar; DuPont; Eaton; Ethox Chemicals; Gap Inc.; General Electric; Honeywell; Illinois Tool Works Inc.; International Paper; INA USA; ITRON; Kraft Foods Group, Inc.; MAR-MAC; MeadWestvaco; Medtronic; Nation Ford Chemical; Nestlé; Resolute Forest Products; Schneider Electric; Siemens Corporation; Solvay; The Coca-Cola Company; The Michaels Stores, Inc.; The Procter and Gamble Company; United Technologies; UPS; W.S.

403403083083104	It’s no secret, I love to fish. Whether I’m catching a red fish, black sea bass, or reeling in a gorgeous marlin, I am having a good time. \n\nMy boys and I have spent countless hours fishing South Carolina’s plentiful waterways and coast. One thing that makes fishing so wonderful is the lack of intrusive federal regulations. In order to keep our waterways clean and fisheries populated, states and regional authorities need flexibility to shift catch limits as water conditions and fish populations change.  \n\nLast night, the House passed a bill (H.R. 1335) that ensures states maintain this flexibility and empowers local experts who know the needs of their region. Like many avid sportsmen, I want to see our South Carolina and South Atlantic Coast fishing community thrive, and I was proud to support legislation that makes it easier for local experts to manage our needs. \n\nRead more about this bill here: http://1.usa.gov/1Jirnh6	845286902228051

403403083083104	Since the Great Recession began in 2007, real median household income has dropped 8.7 percent.  This decrease in pay has made it difficult for American families to get back on their feet.  Meanwhile, during the same time period, the average federal bureaucrat salary has ballooned nearly 12 percent.  This is a 20% disparity in 7 years illustrated in the graph below. \n\nThe federal employees receiving pay raises are the people making decisions, as well as implementing regulations impacting our impish economic recovery. Since their salaries are not tied to economic success or supported by consumer spending, bureaucrats do not have any skin in the game. Simply, they do not feel the consequences of the federal government’s grip on the economy.  If federal government employees’ jobs and pay were directly tied to the economy, like most Americans, they would likely approach decision making differently. \n\nAt the beginning of this month, I sent out a poll question to get your feedback on a legislative idea that would hold bureaucrats accountable for their decisions.The poll asked, “Do you think federal government employees making more than $100,000 a year should have their salaries reduced until the middle-class salary levels rise to pre-recession levels?” See the results pictured in the pie chart pictured below. \n\nOf the respondents, 72.42 percent think that federal employees making six-figures should have their salaries reduced until American middle-class incomes return to pre-recession levels.  After studying this issue in depth, I introduced legislation last week that would link six-figure bureaucrat salaries to real median household incomes.  \n \nThe Promoting Accountability In Decisions (PAID) for Progress Act (H.R. 1137), reduces all federal government employee salaries, except active duty military officials, over $100,000 by 8.7 percent, which is the current decrease in real median household income.   As the economy recovers and real median household salaries increase, so will federal employees’ salaries. This legislation also applies to all Cabinet members, Members of Congress, the President, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac employees. \n \nWe must continue to incentivize economic recovery. I assure you that I will continue turning over every rock and looking behind every tree for ways to hold the federal government accountable and get our economy thriving again.	806721272751281
403403083083104	367 House members joined together in sending a letter to President Barack Obama about the administration's ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran. Since there are 435 members (245 Republicans and 188 Democrats), it is not often that this many members come together and agree on an issue.  Honestly, I wish it happened more often. But, urgent issues, like those that have arisen in these negotiations, deserve attention and support from a majority of the House. In the letter, we outline our concerns with the Administration's negotiations with #Iran and underscore that relieving sanctions requires legislation so any deal the Administration attempts to broker must satisfy Congress. Here is the text of the letter: \n---\nThe President\nThe White House\nWashington, D.C. 20500\n\nDear Mr. President:\n\nAs the deadline for a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran nears, we write to you to underscore the grave and urgent issues that have arisen in these negotiations.  While we hope the Administration is able to achieve a lasting and meaningful agreement, we understand that there are several difficult issues that remain unresolved.\n\nNo issue will be harder to resolve with the Iranian regime than the status of its uranium enrichment program.  This is the key technology Iran would need to develop a nuclear bomb – technology that Iran has been permitted to continue to research and develop under the interim arrangement.  Many of us wrote to you a year ago, calling for dismantlement of significant portions of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, “such that Iran will not be able to develop, build, or acquire a nuclear weapon.” A final comprehensive nuclear agreement must constrain Iran’s nuclear infrastructure so that Iran has no pathway to a bomb, and that agreement must be long-lasting.  \n\nInternational inspectors report that Iran has still not revealed its past bomb work, despite its international obligations to do so.  Of the 12 sets of questions that the International Atomic Energy Agency has been seeking, Tehran has answered just part of one.  Just last week, the IAEA reported that it is still concerned about signs of Iran’s military related activities, including designing a nuclear payload for a missile.  Indeed, inspectors had amassed “over a thousand pages” which showed “research, development and testing activities” on technologies needed to develop a nuclear weapon.  Last fall, over 350 Members of the House wrote to the Secretary of State expressing deep concerns about this lack of cooperation.  The potential military dimensions of Iran’s nuclear program should be treated as a fundamental test of Tehran’s intention to uphold the final comprehensive agreement.  Unless we have a full understanding of Iran’s past program it will be impossible for the international community to judge Iran’s future breakout time with certainty.\n\nIran’s record of clandestine activity and intransigence prevents any trust in Iran.  Indeed, a top State Department negotiator has told Congress that, “deception is part of [Iran’s] DNA.”  Even during the period of negotiations, Iran has illicitly procured nuclear technology, which your Administration quickly sanctioned.  Additionally, because of the strict inspections regime under the Joint Plan of Action, Tehran was caught testing a more advanced centrifuge that would have helped produce bomb material more quickly.  Given Iran’s decades of deception, negotiators must obtain maximum commitments to transparency by Iran.  Any inspection and verification regime must allow for short notice access to suspect locations, and verifiable constraints on Iran’s nuclear program must last for decades.   \n\nFinally, while the negotiations with Iran have focused exclusively on Iran’s nuclear program, it is critical that we also consider Iran’s destabilizing role in the region.  Iran is boosting Assad in Syria, supporting sectarian elements in Iraq that undercut hopes for a unified and stable country, and providing assistance to Hezbollah, which continues to threaten Israel.  And last month, an Iranian-backed militia displaced the government in Yemen, a key counterterrorism partner.  Iran’s Supreme Leader has also called for an expansion of his country’s ballistic missile program, yet another dimension of the potential threat posed by Iran.  Iran’s role in fomenting instability in the region—not to mention Iran’s horrendous repression at home—demonstrates the risks of negotiating with a partner we cannot trust.   \n\nThe United States has had a longstanding interest in preventing Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons capability.  Over the last twenty years, Congress has passed numerous pieces of legislation imposing sanctions on Iran to prevent that outcome, ultimately forcing Iran into negotiations.   Should an agreement with Iran be reached, permanent sanctions relief from congressionally-mandated sanctions would require new legislation.  In reviewing such an agreement, Congress must be convinced that its terms foreclose any pathway to a bomb, and only then will Congress be able to consider permanent sanctions relief.\n\nResolving the nuclear crisis with Iran remains of grave importance to our nation’s security.  As the Administration continues to negotiate with Iran, we are prepared to evaluate any agreement to determine its long-term impact on the United States and our allies.    We remain hopeful that a diplomatic solution preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon may yet be reached, and we want to work with you to assure such a result.\n\n---	805884579501617

403403083083104	Last week, I introduced H.R. 1137, the Promoting Accountability In Decisions (PAID) for Progress Act, which would cut six-figure bureaucrats salaries (excluding active military) by 8.7% until the economy recovers to pre-recession levels. This would also apply to elected federal officials. \n\nWhen the economy tanked, middle-class families and mid-level American workers were hit the hardest. Government regulations have restricted recovery, causing every day expenses like gas, groceries, and electricity to eat up families’ budgets. Meanwhile, the federal bureaucrats making these decisions and imposing regulations, are taking home more than $100,000 a year. \n\nThis bill would cut regulators’ salaries until the economy recovers, giving them an incentive to get government out of the way so the free market system can work.  \n\nWhen take-home pay for everyday Americans returns to pre-2007 levels, so should federal government salaries.

I'd like to share it with you.\n\n"This experience with Congressman Tom Rice’s office has been the most comforting, reassuring professional experience I've had, with any organization, since moving to Myrtle Beach, 4+ years ago!  \n \n"I stand amazed at your office's efficiency and sensitivity!  With all the hideous chaos in the news and this world…..to know my congressman has such an organized staff and office is especially calming.  \n \n"Tom Rice has my vote forever.  Susan Dean has my vote, prayers and a big hug, too.  She was most kind when we were most discouraged. She never once made us feel like she was in a hurry or uninterested….we felt like she sincerely cared and was there to help and serve …..one outstanding young woman that speaks volumes for your office! \n\nExtremely and humbly grateful."\n\nI am truly blessed to work with some very caring and talented people: Andrew Mims (District Director), Susan Dean (Constituent Services Representative), Chris Needham (Constituent Services Representative), Tom Keegan (Field Representative), Pam Ratliffe (Constituent Services Representative), John Sweeney (Field Representative), and Rodney Berry (Economic Development Representative). \n\nOur district staff goes above and beyond. If you ever need help with a passport, assist in finding out the status of a Social Security or VA claim, receiving lost medals, or dealing with a federal agency, please contact one of our district offices. We are here to serve you. \n\nGrand Strand District Office: 843-445-6459\nPee Dee District Office: 843-679-9781	794039384019470
130725126985966	We're live! If you'd like to join tonight's telephone town hall, please call 1-877-229-8493, ID Code: 19641. \n\nI'll be taking questions until around 7:30.	886891444702660
130725126985966	Instead of our regular weekly column, the Congressman would like to share the message below: \n \nThe last six weeks have been extremely difficult for my family and me. Pam was a special lady, and I loved her very much. The sadness I’m feeling now will be with me for a long time, but I know Pam would want us to carry on. She was so strong and selfless, and the number of people who have honored her life is a testament to the kind of woman she was. She touched many lives, especially mine, and I was blessed to call her my wife. Now she’s with our Lord and Savior, and that brings our family comfort. \n \nOn behalf of my entire family, to everyone who has called, visited, sent a card, texted, e-mailed or prayed for us, thank you. I want you to know that each of you has helped lift our spirits and we will never forget your kindness. The days, weeks and months ahead will be difficult and we ask for your continued prayers. Again, we thank you for your support and understanding.	869714976420307
130725126985966	Next Tuesday evening from 6:35 to 7:35 I'll be hosting a telephone town hall. I look forward to taking your questions and hearing what's on the minds of East Tennesseans. \n\nWhat issues would you like to hear me discuss?	861450427246762
130725126985966	A member of my immediate family has been diagnosed with a very serious illness, and in the weeks ahead I will be limiting my time in Washington to support my family. \n\nAll offices will remain open, and my staff will continue working on behalf of East Tennesseans and to ensure constituents with new and previously opened cases receive assistance. \n\nMy family and I appreciate your thoughts and prayers, and we ask for privacy and your continued support as we work through this together as a family.	850580335000438
130725126985966	Heading back to Washington for a busy week. Tonight President Obama will give his State of the Union address. \n\nWhat would you like to hear from the president this evening?	843306762394462
130725126985966	It’s disappointing President Obama announced yet another new government program with no clear plan to pay for it during his visit to Tennessee. \n\nThe president was right to hold up Governor Haslam’s Tennessee Promise plan as an effective way to prioritize higher education, but a better way to expand access to college would be to encourage states to follow Tennessee’s example and find state-based solutions that work for their citizens, not create another expensive, one-size-fits-all federal program.	837974216261050
130725126985966	I'll be returning to Washington next week to be sworn in for the 114th Congress. It is truly an honor to serve the First District and I remain committed to addressing many important issues facing our nation such as job creation, immigration, the VA, health care, the deficit and out-of-control spending, education and protecting the Constitutional rights of Americans - just to name a few.\n\nAs your Congressman, I'd love to hear from you. What issues are most important to you and your family? What would you like to see me focus on in the upcoming year? Feel free to leave your thoughts in the comment section below or send me an email by visiting my website.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and I wish you and your family a safe and happy new year!	831068263618312
130725126985966	Thank you to everyone that participated in my telephone town hall tonight! As a reminder, you can reach me anytime. My contact information can be found at roe.house.gov.	817683474956791
130725126985966	Because of a change in the House voting schedule, my telephone town hall will be from 5:30 - 6:30 p.m. this evening. The dial in number will be the same: 1-877-229-8493, ID Code: 19641\n\n*Please note: this will not be a working number until the call is scheduled to begin.*\n\nI hope you can join me!	817618884963250
130725126985966	My thoughts and prayers are with our neighbors in Knoxville this evening.	813891555335983
130725126985966	I strongly support construction of the Keystone Pipeline and am proud to support its approval once again. This project has widespread, bipartisan and bicameral support and would help reduce our dependence on oil from unstable countries while creating jobs. Widespread support for the pipeline combined with the State Department’s assessment that proved the project to be environmentally sound should have paved the way for construction to move forward. \n\nStill, President Obama has repeatedly delayed and slow-walked the permitting process. Now that the president’s allies also openly support this project, I hope he will listen to Senate Democrats and stop holding back our country’s economic growth. It’s time to allow the pipeline to move forward.	804356726289466
130725126985966	Pam and I are saddened to hear of the passing of Judge Mike Faulk. Mike was a dear friend, and I’ll miss walking parades with him and his beloved dog Rueban. Mike has served our community for many years, and this loss will be felt throughout East Tennessee. Our thoughts and prayers are with Judge Faulk’s family, friends and colleagues during this difficult time.	803481083043697
130725126985966	Eric Holder’s resignation is long overdue. It is the duty and responsibility of the attorney general to enforce the law and to prosecute those who do not obey it, but too often, he selectively enforced our laws, which weakens all Americans’ confidence in the judicial system. \n\nAdditionally, on Eric Holder’s watch, the Department of Justice was responsible for the botched Operation Fast and Furious, targeted a reporter for prosecution, and refused to investigate political targeting at the IRS. \n\nOur next Attorney General must commit to upholding the rule of law.	777140935677712
130725126985966	On the eve of the anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, we are reminded that the threat of terrorism still exists. As Americans, we have a responsibility to protect our citizens, our interests and to be leader for the rest of the world. \n\nWhile I don’t often agree with President Obama, something must be done to eradicate the evil we’re seeing the Islamic State spread across Iraq and Syria. I believe the president’s proposal deserves careful consideration and I will continue to seek input from East Tennesseans before making any final decision.\n\nI would love to read your thoughts in the comments below.	770069606384845
130725126985966	Reminder: I'll be in Stoney Creek TONIGHT at 6:30 for a town hall meeting at Unaka Elementary School. I hope you can join me!\n\nWhat issues would you like to hear discussed?	765936230131516
130725126985966	In case you missed it: my statement on Friday evening's vote to address the border crisis can be found below.\n\nIt’s clear the president’s immigration policies are failing and that’s why the House had to act. We must address the heart of the crisis, which is that immigrants are making a dangerous journey, risking their lives because of a mistaken belief they will be allowed to stay and ultimately be granted citizenship. The most compassionate, humane solution we can enact ensures immigrants are returned quickly and safely to their families, and these bills do just that.\n \nTo secure our border, it is not enough to simply give our states additional funding. President Obama’s Executive Action to defer action on younger illegal immigrants is at the heart of this crisis, which is why it is absolutely essential to freeze DACA and ensure the president cannot give administrative amnesty in the future.\n \nPassage of these bills will discourage families from sending their child on a dangerous – and sometimes fatal – journey, strengthen our border, and send a strong message to the president that his immigration policies are not working.	751593208232485

130725126985966	Senator Baker was a great American, devoted to public service and to the great state of Tennessee. He was a true statesman who always put the greater good before party lines. Howard Baker set an example we’d all do well to follow. I was saddened to hear of his passing, and Pam and I will keep his family in our thoughts and prayers.	731326140259192

130725126985966	Today is Flag Day.\n\n"As we think back over the history of our nation's flag, we remember that the story of its early years was often one of hardship and trials, sometimes a fight for simple survival. ... As the American Republic grew and prospered and new stars were added to the flag, the ideal of freedom grew and prospered. From the rolling hills of Kentucky to the shores of California to the Sea of Tranquility on the Moon, our pioneers carried our flag before them, a symbol of the indomitable spirit of a free people. And let us never forget that in honoring our flag, we honor the American men and women who have courageously fought and died for it over the last 200 years, patriots who set an ideal above any consideration of self. Our flag flies free today because of their sacrifice." -President Ronald Reagan, June 14, 1986	724515554273584
189998554345168	This evening, the Nuclear Cleanup Caucus had a productive panel discussion with Department of Energy officials to discuss how we can successfully achieve our nuclear cleanup mission. As the Chairman of this caucus, I have worked to promote awareness of our nuclear legacy and strengthen our cleanup mission.

130725126985966	It’s painfully clear this president—a former lecturer in Constitutional law—plans to play by a different set of rules than any other president in history. His climate change agenda is so misguided and unpopular with the American people that he couldn't even get it passed through a Democrat-led House and Senate. Now he's attempting to use the rule-making process to bypass Congress.\n\nPresident Obama needs to understand that changing his strategy on Cap-and-Tax does not change the ugly truth: this is a job-killer and will greatly harm the economy. During a time when many families are struggling to make ends meet, these new rules will cause electric bills and unemployment to skyrocket.\n\nIt’s wrong for the president to move forward with these rules, especially after the people have spoken out against these Cap-and-Tax policies.	717770874948052
130725126985966	I believe Secretary Shinseki’s resignation sends a strong signal to our veterans that there will be accountability for the failures uncovered on his watch, but I am extremely disappointed that we got to this point. I have worked with and have the utmost respect for General Shinseki, and I am incredibly grateful for his service to our country. \n\nWith that said, it is time to turn the page and begin a new chapter for our veterans. We must change the culture of the VA- a culture that allowed an entire leadership team to think it was okay to treat veterans this way. \n\nI will continue to actively participate in the VA Committee’s investigation and work tirelessly to bring changes to the VA health care system.	716224158436057
130725126985966	Unfortunately, the Inspector General’s interim report has confirmed that this is the worst possible scenario. It is now clear that these serious problems stretch far beyond simple administrative issues, and we must hold someone accountable. \n\nI have the utmost respect for Secretary Shinseki and his service and I have enjoyed working with him on behalf of our veterans, but it is with a heavy heart that I call for his resignation. \n\nOur veterans deserve better and we must work to make sure fundamental changes are made to the way we care for and treat the men and women that have served this country.	715181385207001
130725126985966	Today, I voted against the USA Freedom Act, a bill that would place limits on the bulk collection of Americans’ phone records by the National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nThe revelations about the NSA’s activities have been concerning to the American people and have clearly eroded many people’s trust in their government. While I believe the USA Freedom Act is a step in the right direction, I do not believe it goes far enough towards ending the collection of bulk data. Since in my view this bill falls short of fully protecting the civil liberties of American citizens, I voted against it.\n\nThe bill would amend Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which originally authorized the bulk collection of the phone records of Americans, and reauthorize the provision with the new restrictions through 2017.	712019888856484

102385999834718	I have never voted for fast-track trade authority in the 26 years I have been in Congress and have voted against it under both Republican and Democratic Presidents. Fast-track limits the authority of Congress and gives too much power to the executive branch.  \n\nThe U.S. hasn’t done a good job negotiating trade agreements. Too often, the deals that have emerged have been a boon for multinational companies but have not been favorable to U.S. workers.	884618638278113

102385999834718	TAX DAY 2015...\nWe have the most confusing, complicated, convoluted tax system. It has so many thousands of pages of fine print that no human being can really understand or know it all.  The United States could move to a simple, flat tax system as other countries have which would raise as much revenue with far lower rates, and without much of the economic and liberty destroying complexity.  As my friend Mac Thornberry noted: There has been no major tax simplification passed by Congress since 1986, but since that time, over 14,400 amendments have been made to the tax code.	854541634619147
102385999834718	Some people have asked why I was listed in the News-Sentinel as voting against a so-called “conservative” budget.  I have always been rated as the most conservative member of the Tennessee delegation and one of the most conservative in the entire Congress.  However, that particular budget had a provision calling for the sale of TVA without setting out any type of plan for doing so and no information about what would happen to the employees.  I did support the final passage of the Republican budget, which repeals funding for Obamacare, calls for more fair and simple tax codes, and cuts $5.5 trillion in government spending.	846652498741394

102385999834718	Now that January has drawn to a close, here is a look at what we have accomplished in the House during the first four weeks of the new Republican Congress.  It includes 27 different pieces of legislation in 13 days, including:\n\n-Approving the Keystone pipeline (with the support of 28 Democrats)\n-Passing the Hire More Heroes Act to make it easier for small businesses to hire veterans without running afoul of Obamacare (passed unanimously and is currently being marked up by the Senate Finance Committee)\n-Reauthorizing TRIA and correcting a Dodd-Frank regulation that harmed manufacturers, farmers, and Main Street businesses (signed into law on January 12)\n-Restoring the 40-hour workweek and protecting the paychecks of millions of Americans (supported by a dozen Democrats)\n-Prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortions\n-Ensuring that Obamacare mandates don’t destroy volunteer fire departments (passed unanimously)\n-Restoring common sense to financial regulations to help small businesses access capital and grow (with the support of 29 Democrats)\n-Expediting the licensing of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports both to create jobs and strengthen our national security (with the support of 41 Democrats)\n-Streamlining the process for building natural gas pipelines so we can lower energy costs for millions of American families (with the support of 14 Democrats)\n-Blocking funds to implement the President’s unconstitutional amnesty\n-Reforming the regulatory process to require agencies to seek public input and adopt the least costly regulations\n-12 separate bills to combat human trafficking, protect the most vulnerable among us, especially children, and help survivors recover	816012401805404
102385999834718	During my time in Congress, I have never voted for an omnibus spending bill.  I am very much opposed to funding the government at the end of the year with massive, last-minute bills where they throw in just about everything but the kitchen sink. It is simply a bad way to do business.\n\nThere really was no way to find out what all was in the bill.  It contained more than $1 trillion in spending at a time we have a national debt of $18 trillion that is still rising at a very fast rate.\n\nOf course in a bill this massive, I could find things that I liked, but I couldn’t vote for a bill that funded President Obama’s amnesty program and included increases for many departments and agencies even above what some were asking.	781804651892846

102385999834718	I was listening to the Bill Cunningham radio show back on September 28th, and he gave a very impassioned and compelling off-the-cuff argument against intervention in the Middle East.  I was able to the get the transcript:\n\n"Right now, what we have bombed since 1991, I have a partial list: Kuwait, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, et al. And no other country on the face of the earth has done this. Obama made the argument tonight that we’re unique. When there’s a problem, we get called. Assuming we had not been involved in Kuwait, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, could things be worse?  If we had not done the 1991 invasion with George Herbert Walker Bush, a great success, all that did was beget the next war beginning in March of 2003, and I was a vehement supporter of that for which I have apologized.  We cannot win. We can’t choose between the Shias and the Sunnis and the Kurds, from between Hamas and Hezbollah, no matter what we do it’s wrong.  We can’t correct it. We can’t correct it from 35,000 feet. And when we had 150,000 soldiers there and the greatest air force in the world, we couldn’t bring Pax Americana to Iraq at all.  In fact, assuming this thing happens, which is happening now to the tune of almost 100 million dollars a day.  We can bomb them for the next 40 years, it won’t make any difference.  We are going to spend ourselves into bankruptcy, for what?"	759837440756234

I admired and respected him almost as much as my own father.\n\nSenator Baker served with great honor and distinction in the U.S. Senate, as Chief of Staff for President Reagan, and as Ambassador to Japan.  He gave me the privilege to be one of his two witnesses before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in support of his nomination as ambassador.\n\nI also had the privilege of introducing and passing the bill to name the federal building in Knoxville after Senator Baker.	687882554618390

189998554345168	Today, we remember the sacrifice that our Lord Jesus Christ made for us. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” John 3:16-17	972042726140743
189998554345168	Today is World Autism Awareness Day. One out of every 68 children is diagnosed with this developmental disability. I stand with these children and their families as we work to overcome this challenging disease.	971645356180480
189998554345168	Thank you for inviting me to speak at the Hamilton Place Rotary Club meeting this afternoon.	971166139561735
189998554345168	We had a very busy week in my Washington, DC office meeting with different groups from Tennessee. Thank you to each of you for coming to share your stories and letting us know how we can help with the issues that are important to you.	968459169832432
189998554345168	This afternoon, I enjoyed speaking at the East Tennessee Development District Board meeting with local leaders from across the district. Thank you for all your hard work to promote economic and infrastructure growth and development throughout East Tennessee.	960526700625679
189998554345168	What an exciting opportunity to be a part of the opening of the Erlanger Regional Operations Center today. This new center will house state-of-the-art technology that will help provide better care to patients throughout East Tennessee.	949717465039936
189998554345168	This week, I spent time in the third district visiting schools and meeting with students. I loved speaking with the foreign policy students at Southern Adventist University as well as meeting Emma and Marina who are part of the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange program.	949716818373334
189998554345168	Thank you to the Chattanooga Rotary Club for inviting me to speak at your meeting this afternoon. I enjoyed visiting with all the members of this important club.	949262218418794
189998554345168	I enjoyed spending yesterday afternoon visiting the new state-of-the-art library at the The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Thank you to all the students who showed me around the new facility.	938965406115142
189998554345168	Congratulations to the graduating class from Miller-Motte Technical College in Chattanooga. It was a pleasure to speak to the students at their graduation ceremony yesterday. The education these students earned is invaluable, and it has greatly prepared them for bright, successful futures.	929904867021196
189998554345168	A few weeks ago, I cosigned a letter to Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, asking the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to listen to cattle producers in Tennessee and improve the existing beef checkoff program rather than implement a new, duplicative program.  I am very pleased to learn that Secretary Vilsack just announced the USDA will not issue a second order. I have been fighting to improve the current industry-supported checkoff program and look forward to the progress.	912642435414106
189998554345168	Over the past few days, I have spent time reflecting on all we accomplished over the past year. From protecting your 2nd Amendment rights to helping fund the Chickamauga Lock to building three new Veterans Affairs clinics in the third district, we have made great progress in 2014. Yet, despite these achievements, there is still much more to be done in the upcoming year. It has been a blessing to serve as your representative, and I look forward to continuing to serve the third district in the New Year.	912532902091726
145110472209094	Today we honor our fallen heroes. Many have made the ultimate sacrifice so that we may live in the land of the free. The brave men and women of our nation's military have ensured that the Unites States remains a beacon of hope and freedom in an often uncertain world. On this Memorial Day we remember those who have fallen in defense of our liberties and we pray for the safety of those who are still serving. Thank you to all the Tennesseans, both past and present, who have worn the uniform of the United States military. May God continue to bless our great nation.	832397796813688
145110472209094	Last night I voted against reauthorizing section 215 of the Patriot Act because I believe this government mass data collection program violates our privacy rights and fundamental liberties. Someone much smarter than me (Benjamin Franklin) once said, "Those who give up their liberty for more security neither deserve liberty nor security." While I certainly understand the need for monitoring potential terrorist activity, section 215 gives the government too much power to intrude on the lives of law-abiding Americans.	828426683877466
145110472209094	I will be hosting a telephone townhall tonight at 6:55-7:55 EST/ 5:55-6:55 CST. However, these times are  subject to change due to votes on the floor of the House this evening. I will be sure to keep you posted. I hope you can join us to talk about  issues like immigration, Iran and our national debt. For participants - 877-229-8493;  PIN = 18304	823318977721570
145110472209094	This week, many of my constituents filed tax returns. Unfortunately, their taxes weren't the only thing they had to pay. Hardworking Americans will spend $233 billion completing their taxes under our country’s tax code. America’s tax system is broken and simply doesn't meet the needs of a 21st century economy. It is time for a simpler, fairer, flatter tax code. To that end, today we will be voting to repeal the Death tax.	816378045082330
145110472209094	Congress must play an active role in any negotiations with Iran. Recently, Prime Minister Netanyahu made a strong case before Congress that we must be wary of any deal that could give Iran the ability to build a nuclear bomb. The prime minister’s concerns have been echoed by many Americans and I too believe we must be vigilant in not entering into any deal that has the potential to put either our country or our allies in jeopardy. A bad deal is certainly worse than no deal.	816028441783957
145110472209094	All, if H.R. 5, the Student Success Act is brought up for a vote, I will be voting against it. We must defund common core and return education back to the states. Do you agree?	813688562017945
145110472209094	All, we are getting a lot of calls from folks who claim they live in Tennessee asking for me to support H.R. 5, the Student Success Act. For those who are not familiar with H.R. 5, it is a reauthorization of No Child Left Behind. I am strongly opposed to this legislation and helped lead an effort to prevent it from reaching the House floor. Call me crazy, but I suspect that most of the Fourth District is against more federal control of education and the folks calling the office in support of this bill aren't really from Tennessee. Am I right?	813284592058342
145110472209094	I was deeply saddened to hear the news that at least 147 Christian students in Kenya were brutally killed by radical Islamic terrorists. Evil cannot and must not be bargained with.	810827338970734
145110472209094	Five years ago this week, Obamacare was signed into law. Since then, the government has spent $42 billion in regulatory costs and over $1.5 billion on a failed website. Plan prices continue to increase, and Medicare Advantage registrants have seen a $1,300 cut in benefits. That is why I have refused to fund this government takeover of health care and will continue to fight until this law is fully repealed.	804011942985607
145110472209094	President Obama may have his "pen and phone" but without the funds to carry out his executive actions, his words are mere bluster. Congress controls the purse and it is incumbent on us to use this power. That is why I refused to support any legislation that funds the president's unlawful executive order on amnesty. Congress is a co-equal branch and we must act like it.	796496063737195
145110472209094	Friends, we have had a busy couple of weeks with H.R. 5, the Student Success Act, and the DHS Funding Bill.  I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you for taking the time to provide your thoughts and feedback to me and my office. I really could not do this job without you. I know we are all frustrated with what is going on in Washington, but thank you for not giving up. Remember, if we don't fight on, then who will?	793679087352226
145110472209094	I voted against the "clean" DHS funding bill today. I will not compromise when it comes to our Constitution. President Obama has shown he has no regard for the principles our nation was founded on. If Congressional Republicans won't hold the line against this president, then who will?	793073774079424
145110472209094	Thank you for your feedback regarding H.R. 5, the Student Success Act. It is clear that the overwhelming majority of you want me to oppose this legislation. That is precisely what I will do. I sincerely appreciate you for taking the time to express your thoughts to my office.	790815170971951
145110472209094	As of right now, it looks like we will be voting on H.R. 5, the Student Success Act, tomorrow. I would like to hear from parents, teachers and those knowledgeable with our state's education system about whether or not I should support this legislation. I am going to refrain from posting talking points from groups either in favor or opposed to this bill, because I am really only concerned about your opinions. I don't mind saying I am leaning "no" but as always I will defer to you. For those who are not familiar with H.R. 5, it is a reauthorization of No Child Left Behind (among other things).	790443247675810
145110472209094	The House has passed legislation fully funding all of the Department of Homeland Security except for the president's illegal actions on amnesty. In my opinion, the House has now done its job and there is no need to revisit the issue. If the Commander-in-Chief chooses to veto this bill, putting the security of our nation at risk, over an act he has already admitted is unconstitutional then that is on him. Undoubtedly, President Obama and his allies will take to the media to throw their usual temper tantrums about "Republicans shutting down the government." Republicans must hold firm. We are right. We are defending the Constitution. And we must not cater to petulance.	787311261322342
145110472209094	Friends, tomorrow I will be attending the annual Pig Day in Franklin county. This event is open to the public and chili and hot-dogs will be served. If you would like to drop by, it starts at 11:00 CST and the location is at the offices of Davis, Kessler & Davis, 705 Dinah Shore Boulevard in Winchester, TN 37398. I hope to see you there so we can talk about some of the things going on in Congress	778496612203807
145110472209094	It is an honor to represent you tonight in the House of Representatives during tonight's State of the Union. While the State of the Union is a solemn event and an opportunity to reflect on the blessings of living in a democracy, I don't hold out much hope the president will articulate anything resembling a credible plan to move our nation forward. What I expect is we'll hear more of the same class warfare and calls for more government spending. What do you think about tonight's event?	774898935896908
145110472209094	Today we will vote on the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act. Due to efforts by conservatives in the House, this legislation will cut off funding and effectively stop President Obama’s dangerous and unlawful amnesty. I am proud of efforts by my fellow conservatives to get House Leadership to put this bill on the floor.	772102679509867
145110472209094	The DesJarlais family would like to wish you and your family a merry Christmas. Thank you all for your friendship. It means a great deal to me. May God bless our troops and provide us with the strength and wisdom to do what is needed to put our country back on the right track. I look forward to continuing our work next year. Merry Christmas!	760665483986920
145110472209094	If the Supreme Court strikes down the federally-run exchanges in ObamaCare, the law will crumble. At that point, Republicans do not need to try to fix the law. We need to fully repeal it.	757271190993016
145110472209094	We have been getting calls to the office urging a "no" vote on what has been dubbed the Cromnibus. I will indeed be voting against this bill. We should not be funding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty order.	753649571355178
145110472209094	I wanted to let you know I plan on voting against the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) today. There is no question I support funding our military. And if this bill did just that, I would support it. However, in true Washington fashion, today’s legislation includes superfluous provisions outside the main intent of the bill. For example, this NDAA  allows President Obama to arm and train Syrian rebel groups, which is at best a waste of taxpayer resources and at worst a grave threat to our men and women serving abroad. I believe the NDAA should focus solely provide funding for OUR troops -- not radical Islamic groups. Further, this legislation also authorizes the president to send money to Ukraine while cutting military compensation. Please let me know if you feel otherwise. The vote is this afternoon.	751029601617175
145110472209094	I promised you I would not support any proposal that provides amnesty to illegal immigrants. I just want to let you know that as Congress works through the government funding bill, I will remain true to that promise. It is critical we secure the border and enforce existing immigration laws.	750731791646956
145110472209094	The DesJarlais family would like to wish you a very happy Thanksgiving. We all have so much to be thankful for here in Tennessee. And while our country certainly faces some monumental challenges, we are blessed to live in the greatest nation in the world. I want to express my thanks for giving me the honor of serving you in Congress. I want to thank our men and women in uniform who risk their lives to defend our freedoms. And I want to thank God for his continued guidance and grace. I especially want to express how grateful I am for all of the thoughts and prayers I received. As many of you know, earlier this year I was diagnosed with cancer. I am truly touched by how many folks reached out offering their support. I am very thankful to report that it looks like I will be making a full recovery. Happy Thanksgiving. God bless you and God bless America.	747972348589567
145110472209094	Happy Veterans Day. Thank you to all who have worn the uniform of the United States military. We are grateful beyond words for your service. Let us take a moment to express our thanks for those who have served and pray for the safety of those men and women who are still fighting in defense of our nation.	741066225946846
6627436391	The Endocrine Society endorses Research for All: \n\n"The consequences of inaction are striking; for example, of the 10 drugs that were withdrawn from the US market from January 1, 1997 through 2001, 8 posed greater health risks for women.

6627436391	President Obama gave an uplifting speech, and I’m proud he mentioned Tennessee as a model for the country. America is creating jobs at the fastest pace since the turn of the century, our gas prices are plummeting, and we’ve beaten a recession. But so much work remains, and Congress must begin behaving in ways that give hardworking Americans a chance to succeed.	10153110285011392

6627436391	Citizen Barrett was more than a legal giant in our community; he was a compassionate soul. George cared deeply for the poor and downtrodden, and championed their rights in court, in the media, and in his every conversation. He had the Irish zest for life, for the latest news, for persuasive argument, and for justice. No one can replace George Barrett in our community, but we should all try, because he made Nashville and Tennessee a better place to live.	10152737509376392
6627436391	Morally, is it right to oppose 120,000 Tennesseans having access to life-saving medical care? Politically, why is Kentucky better at helping its citizens with health care than Tennessee is? I think it’s wrong to be proud of our state’s coldness and slowness. Legally, the courts will almost certainly uphold the ACA again, just as the Supreme Court has already done. http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2014/07/22/scott-desjarlais-optimistic-overturning-health-care-law/13023123/	10152656467836392

6627436391	Corporations shouldn't make people's personal health decisions. The Supreme Court erred when it said corporations are people. Now those so-called people are free to intrude on employees' privacy and health decisions.	10152607741376392
6627436391	Howard Baker was a great statesman who brought Nixon to justice, made the dysfunctional Senate work, and rescued Reagan’s second-term presidency. His sharp mind, gentle manner, and sense of fair play made him a beloved and indispensable figure in American history, whether living in Scott County, Tennessee, or Washington, D.C. He is not only sorely missed; America is starved for his kind of bipartisan leadership. He was our country’s finest.	10152597653646392
6627436391	I respect Gen. Shinseki's decision to resign but that won't help fix the VA. We need a new Secretary fast, more doctors to shorten wait times, structural reforms in the VA and less congressional grandstanding.	10152529301971392
6627436391	Three of my former interns from Middle Tennessee received remarkable scholarships this month. Congratulations to Avery Dobbs, a Fulbright Scholar, and Sam Wilcox, a Truman Scholar! EDIT: And Congratulations to another former intern, Emily Hong, on also being a Fulbright Scholar!	10152444759791392
6627436391	Somehow, the Supreme Court has decided we need more big money in politics. We don’t. Today’s ruling makes it clear that Congress must reverse the corporate takeover of American politics.	10152395580531392
6627436391	The President gave an optimistic, energetic speech urging Congress to behave and put America first. I am proud he praised Tennessee's education reforms. He spoke well tonight and there are positive signs that Congress will do less bickering and more work.	10152255438401392

186436274719648	I was happy to be on hand today as the National Alliance for Caregiving unveiled its “Caregiving in the U.S." report. \n\nWhen I was a long-term care nurse, I met many family caregivers who looked after aging parents or loved ones. They never complain about caring for their family members – they do it as an act of love – but they also want to know that Congress is listening to families like theirs as we make health care decisions in Washington.\n\nAs co-chair of the bipartisan “Assisting Caregivers Today” caucus, I’m working to make sure that government never stands between families and the long-term care options that work best for them.	1056255017737765
186436274719648	What a special moment in Jamestown yesterday. Kermit Robertson, pictured here, reached out to my office asking for help obtaining the medals he was due for his service to our country in the U.S. Navy during the Cuban Missile Crisis. \n\nWe happily obliged and yesterday I had the honor of pinning him with his three medals, including the National Defense Service Medal. Great to have his family join us for this well-deserved honor! #TN06	1051916464838287

186436274719648	So inspired by this morning's 18th annual Women in the Military Wreath Laying Ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. We paid tribute to the women who have died while on duty serving our country and celebrated those who continue to serve. \n\nI was honored to recognize Petty Officer First Class Victoria Alvarez. She is a true patriot and an example for young girls everywhere.	1047382455291688

6470828395	FACT #4: I mentioned TPP in my previous post. TPP is still being negotiated and is NOT what Congress is voting on this week. The text of any final TPP deal will be REQUIRED by law to be publicly available online for months before Congress votes on it. TPA actually exists to make trade deals like TPP more transparent and fair – Under TPA President Obama must make TPP available to the public for 60 days before he can agree to it. Then Congress has weeks and potentially months more to study the deal before a final vote. In short, everyone, members of Congress and the American people, will have months to read the deal before a vote.	10153340800233396
6470828395	I’m continuing to study the TPA legislation and encourage you to do so with me. Tomorrow I’ll continue to bring you facts and hear your thoughts.	10153338965908396
6470828395	FACT#1: TPA is the trade authority process. It does NOT include any trade agreement. What this 114 page bill does is lay out the process that a President must follow to both negotiate and seek approval for a trade agreement. Part of that process is on page 85 of the bill text, requiring the administration to make any trade agreement public and posted online for 60 days before the President can agree to it. That’s also long before Congress actually votes on whether to accept it. Not only will this give Congress oversight, but it gives you all the opportunity to evaluate the proposed trade agreement as well. FULL TEXT HERE: http://1.usa.gov/1KqnWoa	10153338190008396
6470828395	I'll be on WZTV FOX 17 News, Nashville's Waste Watch tonight around 9:30pm CT to talk about the IRS response to my letter requesting a review of the Clinton Foundation's tax-exempt status. Be sure to tune in.	10153336716918396
6470828395	Grateful for the opportunity to speak in front of a room full of successful women entrepreneurs at the NAWBO Luncheon yesterday afternoon. As a former business owner, I learned firsthand the importance of getting involved in government. I'm proud to see this group of women taking action to do just that.	10153328799323396

6470828395	Thank you USO for the opportunity to assemble snack packs for our troops. I enjoyed putting a few together with Kelsey, Spencer, and Riley, who are interning in my Washington, DC office.	10153278680938396
6470828395	I'm writing the IRS commissioner and asking him to review the tax exempt status of the Clinton Foundation. A lot of questions need to be answered. Even President Obama realized the potential for a conflict of interest to arise, which is why he had the Clinton Foundation sign an agreement about how foreign donations were to be handled. Close to 30 of my House colleagues have agreed to sign the letter. Join me tonight on Fox News where I’ll be discussing this issue with Greta Van Susteren at 6:30pm CT/7:30pm EST.	10153262041038396
6470828395	Working on a letter to IRS commissioner John Koskinen asking him to review the tax-exempt status of the Clinton Foundation after recent reports have revealed the Foundation failed to report millions of dollars in grants from foreign governments that it accepted while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Tonight I’ll be joining the David Webb Show on SiriusXM Patriot 125 at 9:40pm EST to discuss my letter. Tune in for more information.	10153260218383396
6470828395	Tomorrow I’ll be speaking with Steve Bannon on Breitbart Sirius XM Radio ahead of my remarks at the South Carolina Freedom Summit. Be sure to tune in around 9am CT/10am EST!	10153249698783396

6470828395	It’s no surprise cyber breaches have put both our personal information and finances at risk. It’s estimated that $445 billion per year is lost to cybercrime across the world economy. I am pleased the House has acted on this important issue and passed two cyber protection measures – the Protecting Cyber Networks Act and the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement (NCPA) Act of 2015. \n\nBoth of these measures would increase the exchange of hacking data between the government and private sector by providing liability protections for voluntary sharing of cyber threats and ensuring your privacy will be protected through the ‘scrubbing’ and removal of your personal information. By sharing cyber threat information, both sides will have the ability to better understand their attackers and bolster their defense so you are protected.	10153217659648396
6470828395	Enjoyed addressing IBM leaders from Tennessee and across the United States about the spirit of innovation.	10153193807003396

6470828395	Once again Senate Democrats are obstructing solutions for American people by refusing to override POTUS veto of #KeystoneXL pipeline.	10153093554688396
6470828395	President Obama’s amnesty is not only unconstitutional, it is making our country less secure. We are standing strong in our fight to stop executive amnesty and must continue to keep the pressure on Senate Democrats to do the right thing.	10153089588073396
6470828395	It might be a small victory, but a group of us conservatives—yes good conservative women-- held together and pushed for pulling HR 5 from consideration. We will keep you posted on further developments. Thank you for continuing to weigh in.	10153083257453396
6470828395	Extremely disappointing that President Obama would veto the Keystone XL pipeline. It is shameful that he continues to put liberal special interests ahead of providing for our nation's energy security and creating jobs for hard-working Americans.	10153076862878396
6470828395	We won a victory today when our bill to make sales tax deduction permanent passed out of the Ways & Means Committee. Ready for floor passage next.	10153048806723396

111456965545421	Minnesota’s Jim Oberstar, the late Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, was a true legislative giant in Congress and the epitome of a fine public servant. I was honored to have been able to work closely with him on the committee and was saddened by his passing just over a year ago. He was one of the first Congressmen to support my first bill in Congress to name the Clifford Davis/Odell Horton Federal Building. He was a Congressional Staffer in 1963, Clifford Davis’ last year in office. \n\nChairman Oberstar was passionate about energy efficiency and successfully passed legislation to install solar panels at the U.S. Department of Energy headquarters in Washington. After he passed away, I led a letter urging the Department to install a plaque honoring Chairman Oberstar so that visitors would know about his role in helping improve energy efficiency in our nation. And this morning, I attended the dedication of that plaque. Chairman Oberstar loved our country and he worked on a daily basis to make it a better place for all of us, and I was pleased to be a part of this small effort to honor his work.	980429918648117
111456965545421	This afternoon, the House will vote on several amendments to the 2016 Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill. I hope the House rejects the Pittenger amendment to cut $25 million from Legal Services Corporation—a critical legal aid program that helps low-income citizens protect and defend themselves in the legal system. The House should also pass these 3 amendments:\n\n- The Rohrabacher-Farr amendment to stop the DEA's War On Drugs tactics in states that allow medical marijuana.\n\n- The Perry amendment to increase access to non-psychoactive, marijuana-derived CBD oil that helps children suffering from conditions like epilepsy.\n\n- The McClintock-Polis amendment to stop the DEA's War On Drugs tactics that waste taxpayer dollars in states with legal marijuana use.	976007665757009
111456965545421	This Memorial Day and all others, we pay tribute to the memory of the brave men and women who gave their lives defending our nation and our liberty. We should all take a moment to reflect on their selfless courage, commitment to our country, and the sacrifice they and their families made to keep us safe. I encourage all Memphians to keep our nation’s heroes in their thoughts.	966033690087740
111456965545421	I enjoyed meeting with members of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) in the Capitol this morning and was proud to receive their Board of Directors Special Appreciation Award, which recognizes my "leadership role in Congress" on criminal drug policy reform.	965589483465494
111456965545421	Early education is not a partisan issue. Today marks the 50th anniversary of the launch of Head Start, which provides a strong start benefiting children across the nation--including 4,300+ in Shelby County last year alone.	964295946928181
111456965545421	Last night I had the pleasure of speaking to a packed room at the Marijuana Policy Project's 20th Anniversary Gala. Drug policy reform is long overdue. The science has been in for a long time and keeping marijuana on the same list of the most dangerous controlled substances—along with heroin and LSD—doesn’t make any sense. \n\nI’m pleased that we’re finally seeing increased bipartisan support for this important issue and I will continue fighting to pass the CARERS Act that I introduced with Senators Cory Booker, Rand Paul, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Congressman Don Young to bring the federal government in line with the science and with the American people, respect states’ rights, remove the threat of prosecution in states with legal or medical marijuana, and help Americans access the treatments they need.	956610294363413
111456965545421	Enjoyed my impromptu press conference with foreign reporters following Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's speech to Congress this morning. I answered a lot of questions about our relationship with Japan and about the Prime Minister's speech.	956054671085642
111456965545421	I'll be on msnbc's All In with Chris Hayes from Memphis tonight at 7:30 CT -- I hope you'll tune in to see me.	948926748465101
111456965545421	It’s been 52 years since the Equal Pay Act passed, but it still takes almost 67 weeks for a woman to earn what a man earns in 52 weeks (1 year), while an African American woman earns just 64 cents for every dollar white males earn. It’s time for equal pay for equal work, Congress must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act! #EqualPayNow	947812348576541
111456965545421	I'll be on CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront to discuss the continuing negotiations with Iran tonight. I hope you'll tune in at 6 CT!	941071569250619
111456965545421	The House Judiciary Committee passed the Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act, a bipartisan bill that I helped lead with Republican Congressman Steve Chabot of Ohio which would make foreign art more accessible in American museums. Currently, American museums and universities are often denied the opportunity to borrow art owned by foreign governments due to unnecessary legal barriers and the fear of artwork being caught up in our legal system. \n\nOur bipartisan legislation would remove those barriers and make foreign artwork and artifacts more accessible to the public to view, study and appreciate in American schools and museums while preserving important protections in current law for Holocaust-related claims. I am pleased that it passed our committee and I hope the full House considers it soon.	937231939634582

111456965545421	The full-page New York Times advertisement accusing Ambassador Susan Rice of ignoring genocide is unfortunate and wrong. Reasonable minds may disagree but character assassination is never appropriate. \n\nIt is unfortunate that the firestorm surrounding Prime Minister Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress has caused such conduct, but this is not about Susan Rice, it is not about Rwanda. This is about what is good for Israel and what is appropriate diplomatic behavior. \n\nThe Prime Minister's speech, at the time it is scheduled and in the way it was planned, is harmful to both Israel and reasonable discourse in Washington.	924083857616057
111456965545421	Ever since an exhibition game in Memphis where he--through a white player because of segregation--gave me a baseball and befriended me when I was only 5, Minnie has been a hero of mine. That initial meeting and the fact that he felt he could not give me, a child on crutches because of Polio, the ball directly and had to hand it to a white player instead made him my hero.\n\nFive years later, when Minnie came back to Memphis for another exhibition game, I visited him at the Lorraine Motel where he stayed with other black players while the white players stayed at the Peabody. These early experiences in my life helped me understand the horrors of segregation, discrimination, and prejudice.\n\nI spoke about Minnie on the floor of the House of Representatives when I worked to pass a resolution recognizing the contributions of the Negro Baseball Leagues to our nation's history, and as recently as last December because he was once again denied admission the Baseball Hall of Fame. The last time I saw him was at the Civil Rights Baseball Game in 2009. I told him that the Negro Leagues Resolution had been stopped in the Senate and amended by Senator Jim Bunning, who during his time in the Major Leagues was known to brush back and often hit batters, to take out the portion I'd written that said Minnie would have been in the Hall of Fame but for the years segregation. Minnie, who was known to crowd the plate and often led the Majors in hit-by-pitches, then told me of his history with Bunning. One year at an exhibition game in Cuba, Bunning hit Minnie with a pitch, so Minnie responded by hitting a triple off the left field wall. He told me that Bunning never forgot that day, and apparently he did not.\n\nMinnie had a great baseball career but an even better life. He was an all-star on the diamond, but also an all-star as a human being. He was a major part of my life, influencing it for the better. I grieve him today as a family member.	923835364307573
111456965545421	In the same week that the House voted to honor the Selma march Foot Soldiers with a Congressional Gold Medal I also joined my friend, Congressman John Conyers, in cosponsoring the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015. \n\nOur bill would restore critical components of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court struck down and asked Congress to update more than a year ago. \n\nSince that misguided Supreme Court ruling, efforts to once again limit the right to vote can now be seen throughout the country. It is as important as ever that the law protect our right to vote and protect citizens from discrimination.\n\nAs we reflect upon the hard work and bravery that led to Voting Rights Act five decades ago, we must recognize that this fight for our rights is ongoing and unfinished. Every Congressperson should support the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. \n\nDoing so would be in the spirit of the Civil Rights Act and would help America better live up to our creed that all individuals are created equal.	916217605069349
111456965545421	42% of our country's roads are congested, which costs commuters and businesses $121 *billion* every year in wasted time and fuel. The piecemeal, short-term approach that we have taken over the last several years forced the Tennessee Department of Transportation to delay more than $66 million in road improvement and construction projects in Shelby County that could help reduce traffic around Memphis. It's time for Congress to pass a long-term surface transportation bill to boost our nation's economy and help create good-paying jobs.	915130038511439
111456965545421	Dr. John Shea Jr. was a pioneer in the field of otology and a legendary doctor in Memphis who helped usher in a new era of treatment. He came from one family of physicians and leaves behind another. Memphis will miss Dr. Shea and I send my condolences to his wife, Lynda Lee Mead, and family.	914800915211018
111456965545421	Today is a sad day; another Memphis treasure lost. Zeke Logan was funny, friendly, and down-to-earth. Zeke and Drake had me on their show many times and were very supportive, and I recall spending a nice afternoon in Washington having an outdoor lunch with Zeke and his family, whom he loved so much. I am sorry to learn of his passing and send my condolences to his family and loved ones.	914760561881720
111456965545421	I'm about to go on msnbc's All In with Chris Hayes to discuss PM Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress & Speaker Boehner undermining President Obama's foreign policy. Tune in at 7pm central!	914394611918315
111456965545421	Today’s Tennessee Senate Committee vote to kill Governor Haslam’s private Medicaid expansion plan is foolish because it leaves $1 billion in federal funds each year on the table that could have helped keep hospitals open, boosted our economy, and improved our citizens’ health.\n\nThe vote is sad because it shows inhumanity and disdain for Tennessee’s sick and our poorest citizens in need of health care.\n\nAnd today’s vote is sick because some of those Tennesseans will die as a result of this decision. \n\nThose who voted ‘no’ today made a foolish, sad, sick and outright wrong decision.	911910322166744
111456965545421	Today, House Republicans will again vote--for the 56th time--to repeal or undermine President Obama's landmark Affordable Care Act, which is already helping provide 10 million previously uninsured Americans with high-quality, affordable insurance coverage. The #ACAworks and has pushed the uninsured rate down to record lows. It's time for Congress to put people over politics and put an end to these messaging votes!	911411462216630
111456965545421	Each February, we celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation. The courage, creativity, and resilience of African-Americans throughout our nation’s history cannot be overstated. This month, we pay special attention to the many political, scientific, artistic and cultural contributions made by African-Americans to our country.\n\nThe significant contributions that African-Americans have made to our nation have occurred even as African-Americans were legally enslaved, then treated as second-class citizens and even today as African-Americans still deal with the economic injustice that is a vestige of Jim Crow and other discriminatory laws. Their contributions have continued even when they were denied credit for them. Even while suffering under these circumstances, African Americans have continuously helped our nation succeed.\n\nWhile our nation has made great strides for civil rights in the fifty years since the marches from Selma to Montgomery, there is much work left to do to bind up the wounds of slavery and Jim Crow. As we look forward to the next fifty years, let us recommit to realizing Dr. King’s dream and work to ensure all Americans have equal opportunities and that their civil rights are protected, preserved, and strengthened.	910977008926742
52454091867	Today I assembled with hundreds of faithful believers at the Hope Center to recognize America’s National Day of Prayer. It was great to be with Frank Reed from KLTY – 94.9 FM, fellow Vietnam veteran Allen B. Clark, and other area residents to pray for our nation.  \n\nWe’re so fortunate to live in a free country where everyone can practice their faith without fear of persecution. Not everyone around the world enjoys this same freedom.  In fact, when I was in the Hanoi Hilton for nearly seven years, my fellow POWs and I were unable to freely worship God without being punished – which we often were.  But God is faithful.  He was with me.	10152858693361868
111456965545421	President Obama’s budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2016 is a positive vision for our nation’s future that will put us on a sustainable fiscal path. It will spur further economic growth by making critical investments to improve our roads and bridges—creating jobs in Memphis and around the country—and boost take-home pay for the middle-class while closing tax loopholes that allow the wealthiest one percent to avoid paying their fair share.\n\nThe President’s budget also gives middle-class families better access to higher education by making college more affordable and helps young adults climb out from under a mountain of student debt by capping monthly payments. And it will also help them find jobs by doing more to develop the high-paying, private-sector jobs that will keep our country competitive in the 21st century.\n\nAnd by reversing mindless sequestration cuts, this budget proposal will reinvest in the National Institutes of Health, which is another U.S. department of defense that protects us from deadly diseases and illnesses—because Americans are far more likely to be stricken by Alzheimer’s, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, stroke, cancer, or Parkinson’s than by a terrorist attack. President Obama’s budget will help make our economy work for all Americans instead of just the wealthiest among us, and it is a step in the right direction.	910961788928264
111456965545421	More than 50 years ago, the Friendship Nine were wrongfully convicted for exercising their civil rights and highlighting the injustice and inhumanity of Jim Crow. In choosing jail over paying a fine that would merely reinforce a racist policy, the Friendship Nine helped inspire a generation and strengthen the resolve of the civil rights movement.\n\nThe decision by a South Carolina judge to vacate these convictions was long overdue and is further evidence that the injustices of slavery and Jim Crow remain in the South even today. We have made strides over the last five decades, but there still remain too many lingering consequences of these inhumane laws. \n\nFrom racially-biased criminal justice policies to public health and education disparities and from significant economic disadvantages to restrictive voting laws that disenfranchise African-Americans and minorities, we have much work remaining to realize Dr. King’s dream. We must continue the fight to ensure that all citizens, regardless of race, receives fair treatment under the law.	908368089187634

52454091867	As part of my ongoing effort to ensure the solvency of Social Security, today I held a hearing holding the Social Security Administration accountable for its overpayment of disability benefits.  Right now the reality is that Social Security sends the wrong message – if you go back to work, you may get hit with a major overpayment bill from Social Security through no fault of your own.  That’s wrong!  We need to put an end to that. We also need to make sure that the disability system encourages people to work and makes it easy as possible for them to do so.  We can’t have a system that punishes them for doing so!	10152959040311868

52454091867	Today Congress recognized America's Fighter Aces with its highest honor - the Congressional Gold Medal.  Last year, Congress passed my resolution honoring this elite group, and it was great to help honor them at the Gold Medal Ceremony. Fighter Aces are rare.  While over 60,000 U.S. military fighter pilots have taken to air, less than 1,500 have been honored with the coveted status of "Fighter Ace." And only a few hundred remain with us today. We are the land of the free because of these brave and skilled individuals - and all our troops and veterans! I thank our Fighter Aces  - and their families - for their service to our Great Nation, and I salute them.	10152885072256868

This important bill would help crack down on sex-trafficking and also provide support to victims of this horrible crime which is unfortunately happening in our own backyard.  In fact, just last month I had the privilege of attending a local task force meeting on this very issue.  As your Congressman but as well as a husband, father, and grandfather, I will continue to do all I can to stop this horrible crime from happening in the first place!	10152882216321868
52454091867	This week my staff and I heard from a number of you regarding a provision in the Defense Authorization bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to serve in the military.  I am pleased to report that I voted to remove this provision by supporting an amendment by Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) that passed the House last night by a vote of 221-202.   At a time when Obama’s Defense Department is handing out pink slips to American service members  it is simply outrageous that Obama’s allies in Congress are pushing to get the military to hire illegals.	10152871925901868
52454091867	This morning I had the opportunity to meet with some students from Garden Spot High School who will be traveling to Vietnam next month. My thanks to these students and their teachers for their interest in the Vietnam War and the experience my fellow POW buddies and I had at the infamous Hanoi Hilton.	10152869944346868
52454091867	If you didn't get a call from us to hear tonight's Tele-Town Hall and would like to listen in, dial 832-225-5885, ext. 28651. There is limited space, so if you don't get in on the first dial hang up and try dialing in again.	10152866759516868
52454091867	I'm still taking questions in advance for tonight's tele-town hall, which will begin around 6pm central.

52454091867	Yesterday morning I was blessed to meet with local Collin County pastors for a roundtable discussion on the eve of the National Day of Prayer. It was a pleasure to talk to these men and woman about a cornerstone of our Republic - the freedom of religion.  We must forever guard against attempts to erode this cherished freedom.	10152858270966868
52454091867	ISIS claimed credit for the terrible attack in Garland, but the real credit goes to the brave and valiant police officer who took down two heavily armed terrorists - by himself! He saved countless lives and we owe him a debt of gratitude for his selfless heroics. His remarkable courage under fire will be celebrated for generations to come.	10152855986646868
52454091867	Monday night we met to recognize and celebrate 81 exceptional students who faithfully served on this year’s Congressional Youth Advisory Council! Our distinguished speaker Lieutenant Colonel Allen West, a great American who has dedicated his life to serving our Great Nation, helped to make the night a true success. And he was correct when he said these bright students are "carrying on a legacy." I have so much pride and confidence in our Great Nation’s future – because each and every one of the students on this year’s council is going somewhere great!	10152855211381868
52454091867	Today I want to recognize all the hard working teachers from the 3rd District of Texas. Thank you for the hard work you put in to enrich the minds of our youngest Texas citizens.	10152855171296868
52454091867	I believe that charitable giving plays a vital role in our community – it is part of our National identity.  It’s how we show support to our friends, our neighbors, and other individuals in their time of need.  Today I attended the FBI Agent’s Association Golf Tournament held in memory of Special Agent David Fink, a 22-year FBI veteran to benefit four worthy causes: The Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, FBI Agents Association, 12th Man Kickoff Team Foundation, and Allies in Service.	10152854246716868
52454091867	We owe a debt of gratitude to those who helped thwart brazen terrorists in Garland. My prayers go out to those impacted by this horrible event and I am glad to hear that the wounded officer is on the mend. There is no place for evil in the heartland - this is God's country.	10152853771461868
52454091867	The 2015 Congressional Art Competition came to a close last night with my annual free exhibit and awards ceremony to showcase our high school student artists' original work. I'm so proud of ALL our students who participated, as well as all of this year's winners!

Thank you to ALL our servicemen and women. North Texas is home to many troops and veterans, and I continue to work hard to ensure you are well represented in Washington! If you ever need assistance with a federal agency, please contact me and my staff so we can be of help!	10152782809781868

52454091867	5 yrs ago, Obamacare was signed into law. So far, this government takeover of health care has cost Americans $42 billion in regulatory costs and over $1.5 billion on the failed exchange website. Meanwhile, folks' plan prices continue to increase and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries have seen a $1300 cut. These are just SOME of the reasons why I have opposed this law at every turn and have voted four times for its full and permanent repeal.  So MY wish on Obamacare's birthday is that this law is repealed AND replaced. Hardworking American families want, need, and deserve the freedom to choose their own doctor and their own health care plan!	10152768558531868
52454091867	Thank you to everyone at UTD Center for Brain Health for all the hard work you do on behalf of others! What a great visit today!	10152742441971868
7875604788	My thoughts and prayers go out to my fellow Texans who continue to deal with rising flood waters, especially those who are missing and the families of those who have perished.	10153432699839789
7875604788	This weekend, I toured the storm damage in Van, Texas, and met with local officials, volunteers, and residents leading the clean-up and rebuilding efforts. For those in Van in need of assistance or for those who wish to help the people of Van as they recover from the storm, please visit the link below for a list of resources. http://hensarling.house.gov/resources-for-van-tornado-victims	10153392452454789
7875604788	My thoughts and prayers are with the citizens of Van and the surrounding areas that were impacted by last night’s tornado and damaging rains – especially the family and friends of those who perished – and the brave first responders who continue working to protect the community. My office has been in contact with local officials to offer our assistance and will continue to monitor the situation so we can be helpful to East Texans impacted by these devastating storms.	10153374490824789
7875604788	Today is the National Day of Prayer, a significant day that reminds Americans to humbly ask God for His guidance and presence and in our daily lives. Prayer is an extremely powerful tool because it allows us to acknowledge that we are all God’s children and it reminds us to have faith that He will guide our lives in the right direction. This National Day of Prayer is a time to reflect upon the fact that we have been endowed by our Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The God that gave us life also gave us the special gift of liberty as well. Today, as Americans mark the National Day of Prayer, I especially ask Americans to pray for our brave men and women in uniform who are fighting to preserve the freedoms we enjoy as Americans, and for our nation’s first responders who put their lives on the line each and every day to keep our families and communities safe.	10153367093759789
7875604788	As we learn more about the senseless attack yesterday, my thoughts and prayers are with the citizens of Garland and those who were in attendance - especially the security guard who was shot and all the brave first responders who acted swiftly to ensure the safety of all event participants.	10153361233679789

7875604788	Over the last two weeks, I've had the privilege of traveling across the 5th District to meet with constituents at town hall meetings and hear from them about the issues they care about.

7875604788	I had a great time at the #NationalPrayerBreakfast this morning. It's always encouraging to see so many come together to pray for our nation. I was honored to have Pastor Marty Reid and his wife, Melia, of Trinity Family Church in Forney attend as my guests.	10153133350504789
7875604788	I'll join Varney & Co. on Fox Business just after 11:00am CT/12:00pm ET to give my review on #SOTU. Hope you'll tune in.	10153096967434789

7875604788	I am honored and deeply humbled by the trust that the voters of the 5th Congressional District of Texas have placed in me to serve as their representative in the 114th Congress. I am committed to working on your behalf every day to solve the many problems and challenges we face – including stopping executive overreach, especially on immigration; halting Obamacare and replacing it with patient-centered reforms; reforming our broken tax code; and putting an end to cronyism and the Washington insider economy.	10153062032334789
7875604788	I am humbled by the support and trust of my colleagues as I continue my service as chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services. House Republicans know the only real way to grow the economy is from Main Street up, not Washington down. Our committee will continue to focus on promoting sensible solutions to hold both Washington and Wall Street accountable to the American people.	10152922914919789
7875604788	Eric Holder’s decision to step down as Attorney General is long overdue.  From his refusing to cooperate with Congress on the investigation of Fast and Furious to failing to investigate the IRS’ violation of the Constitutional rights of Americans, Eric Holder has presided over a Justice Department that has enabled the Obama Administration to turn our nation from one governed by the rule of law to one governed by the rule of rulers. These actions as Attorney General lost him the confidence of the American people needed to serve as our nation’s top law enforcement official.  While Eric Holder may be leaving, this doesn't excuse the Obama Administration and the Justice Department from working with Congress to answer the serious questions that we have sought answers to.  I hope the next Attorney General will work to uphold the rule of law and respect the Constitution so that the public’s trust in our justice system may be restored.	10152796016639789
7875604788	Yesterday, I had the opportunity to tour the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas as part of a Congressional Delegation led by fellow Texas Congressman Sam Johnson.

I join all Americans in offering my prayers and condolences to Mr. Mandela’s grieving family and the South African people.	10152129161244789
7875604788	Yesterday, I joined a group of House Republicans for a meeting at the White House for what I think was a useful conversation that I hope will lead to meaningful negotiations on solutions to our nation's debt crisis. After the meeting, I joined CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront and Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity to share my thoughts on the meeting and where we go from here. I hope you will take a moment to view these interviews and share your thoughts:\n\nCNN's Erin Burnett OutFront: http://goo.gl/sj9q1j\nFNC's Hannity: http://goo.gl/ycwT0j	10151986317899789
7875604788	Only one person has the power to ensure we don’t default on our sovereign debt obligations, and that person is the president. House Republicans have shown repeatedly over the last few weeks, in plan after plan, that we are willing to negotiate. After continually refusing to negotiate – both in public comments and in private meetings – I am hopeful that President Obama has invited House Republicans to the White House tomorrow because he wishes to have a serious discussion aimed at finding solutions to our nation’s debt crisis, not to reiterate his refusal to negotiate and to demand we rubber stamp his spending and borrowing plan.	10151982914024789
7875604788	My staff & I are safe after shots fired on Capitol Hill. We are sheltering in place and praying for the safety of the Capitol Police and others involved.	10151970466844789
7875604788	Tonight, the House will vote for a third time to fund the government and avoid a shutdown. Tonight, for a third time, the House will invite Washington Democrats to negotiate with us. At this point, it all comes down to two questions. First: are Harry Reid and President Obama willing to #shutdown the government to give Congress special treatment under #Obamacare? Second: Why shouldn't Americans receive the same delay under #Obamacare that President Obama gave to their employers?	10151965123184789
7875604788	Tonight, the House voted to fund the government and avoid a shutdown, delay #Obamacare, repeal the job killing medical device tax, and ensure our troops are paid. Now the Senate must act.	10151961414004789
7875604788	I'll be on Fox & Friends this morning at 8:15am CT/9:15am ET to discuss House efforts to prevent a government shutdown and the need to defund Obamacare. Hope you'll tune in.	10151960024944789
7875604788	My thoughts and prayers are with those at the DC #NavyYard, law enforcement and medical personnel responding, and families of the victims.	10151933592439789

15617630596	Rep. Barton on trade vote: "As a longtime proponent of free trade, I voted in favor of the Trade Priorities and Accountability Act. This vote reflects my belief in free trade and job creation. This legislation does not give the President any new powers or authority, but it does give Congress the ability to vote down any trade deal."	10155723319635597
15617630596	We have sad news to pass along from the Congressman - his mother passed away this morning at the age of 90. Here is what he said about her:\nMy mother,Nell Barton,passed away this morning. She was born February 25,1925 in Speegleville,Texas, outside of Waco. She graduated from Waco High during WWII, attended Baylor and Southwestern before marrying Larry Barton in 1947.\n\nShe had four children, Joe, J, Jan, and Jon. All four graduated from college-something she was very proud of.\n\nShe lived in Waco, Pecos, Bryan-College Station, Ennis, Waco, and Arlington .\n\nShe was a full time homemaker while her children were young. She then worked as a teachers aide in the initial head start early childhood education program. She then worked as an executive Assistant in an insurance agency in Waco. Her final career position was as a school secretary for Bells Hill elementary in the Waco Independent School District.\n\nShe was an active member of various Methodist churches during her lifetime. She was an avid bridge player and had a sharp wit. She could not, however, cook without burning whatever she was cooking!\n\nLate in life she developed Alzheimer's, which contributed to her death.\n\nShe was a vibrant, lively woman who loved life, her family and friends, and her God. She will be missed, but her spirit will live on in her children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.	10155631768150597
15617630596	Met some of the students from International Leadership of Texas Arlington Chapter charter school and took them on a brief tour of the United States Capitol. Great group!	10155602467090597

15617630596	PERSONAL UPDATE from CONGRESSMAN: "I am still in Washington. The House and the Senate voted last night to fund the Homeland Security department for 7 days. I voted 'no' on this, as I did on a longer 3 week extension. Neither bill included language prohibiting any funding from any source to be spent to implement the President's unconstitutional executive order allowing millions of individuals who have come into this country illegally to stay. I support responsible immigration reform, but I do not support the President's usurpation of the legislative power of the Congress."	10155272140005597
15617630596	Rep. Barton votes against stop gap bill that allows President’s immigration executive order to move forward: “The facts haven’t changed. The President’s executive action on immigration is unconstitutional and this legislation doesn’t do anything to stop it. I can’t in good faith vote for something that goes against the Constitution – not for a week, a day or even an hour. Americans will be safe even if a small number of non-essential employees from DHS are temporarily sidelined. In my mind, fully supporting the Constitution is more important than the minor short term effects this debate has on one government department.”	10155270678325597
15617630596	View from our #ArlingtonTX office of I-20! Snow is coming down across North Texas...and road conditions are deteriorating quickly...BE SAFE!	10155268805940597
15617630596	Rep. Barton votes NO on Cromnibus - “The President’s executive action on immigration is unconstitutional. I can’t in good conscious support something that goes against the Constitution – not for 3 months, a week or even a day.”	10154935917255597
15617630596	PERSONAL UPDATE from the CONGRESSMAN: "Congress is almost done for the year. The last issue to be addressed is the catch all spending bill to fund the government until next year. I will vote "NO" because it funds the President's executive order on illegal immigration. The President's executive order is unconstitutional, and I will not vote to fund an unconstitutional act by the President. However, I do support Congress addressing the issue of illegal immigration in 2015."	10154934880880597
15617630596	WHAT DO YOU THINK? President's Approval Rating drops....close to lowest level ever! (Quinnipiac University National poll)\n\nAmerican voters give Obama a negative 39 - 54 percent approval rating, close to his lowest-ever 38 - 57 percent score in a December 10, 2013, Quinnipiac University poll.\n\nDemocrats and voters under 30 years old are the only party, gender or age groups who approve of the president.\n\nOnly 42 percent of American voters trust Obama more than Republicans in Congress to do what is best for the nation, while 47 percent trust Republicans more.\n\nIt's good for the country that Republicans have taken over control of the U.S. Senate, voters say 51 - 37 percent, but 67 percent of voters expect more gridlock in the next two years. Gridlock will be Obama's fault, 44 percent of voters say, as 42 percent would blame Republicans.\n\n"American voters are happy the Republicans have the ball, but don't feel confident there will be a lot of scoring on the deal-making front," Malloy said.\n\n"If that's the case, the numbers say blame will fall on Obama as much as Republicans.\n\n"With the exception of voters born after 1985, Obama's approval is deep under water."	10154882252690597
15617630596	Will be on CNN's The Michael Smerconish Program around 8:30am Texas time talking about President Obama's unilateral #Immigration executive order. TUNE IN!	10154868702855597
15617630596	PERSONAL UPDATE from CONGRESSMAN: "The President just announced his unilateral, unconstitutional action on immigration. Had he announced he was sending these ideas as a bill to the Congress for its consideration, it would have been seriously reviewed and acted on. However, by deciding to issue an executive order, he is thumbing his nose at the Constitution, the Congress, and the American people. I will oppose his executive order. I do not believe it will stand. I do believe the next Congress will enact immigration reform in a Constitutionally correct fashion."	10154864677050597
15617630596	Barton reacts to President’s Executive Action on Immigration:\n \n“It is an abuse of power and shows arrogance to do something by executive order that the President himself admitted is a legislative issue. This Administration should be working with Congress for sensible immigration reform instead of working against the will of the American people by taking extreme steps like this. Voters sent the message that they want cooperation in Washington, not unilateral action. Our immigration system has flaws and they need permanent solutions, but tonight the President just outlined a short term political fix. This nation’s immigrants deserve concrete policies that become law after thorough, transparent discussion.\n \n“I will join my colleagues in using every legislative tool granted by the Constitution to stop this executive overreach and use the legislative process to work the will of the American people.”	10154864299405597
15617630596	PERSONAL UPDATE form the CONGRESSMAN: "I want to thank all of the hundreds of my facebook friends who have wished me a speedy recovery from my gallbladder surgery. I am home now resting, but moving around some too to keep the healing process going. I am a blessed man."	10154649572785597
15617630596	Congressman's Statement on President's ISIS Strategy: \n\n“It is obvious that ISIS is a clear and present danger to the security of our nation. The President and every member of Congress take an oath to ‘defend the nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic.’ Therefore, the President should have clearly and emphatically outlined and defined a strategy to defend our nation and totally defeat ISIS. Sadly, he did not do this. \n\n“You seldom win a war by telling your enemy what you will not do and limiting your options unilaterally. ISIS has repeatedly vowed to bring their terrorism to the United States.  We should make the same decision regarding any and all military actions towards them. We should also take all other steps, economically, diplomatically and morally to isolate and cut them off from international support. We should revoke the passports of any American citizen proven to have enlisted in their ranks. \n\n“The President did not ask for Congressional authorization, but I believe the Congress should specifically authorize action against ISIS. It might be appropriate to pass a declaration of war, to unambiguously show the United States is committed to total victory, but at a minimum the Congress should pass an authorization of force resolution.\n\n“The President had an opportunity tonight to unite the country and show ISIS their days are numbered. Instead, he issued a self-limiting series of half measures that may slow and weaken ISIS, but won't defeat it.”	10154596793020597
15617630596	TUNE IN - Will be on The Ed Show on msnbc around 4:45 Texas time to discuss the ISIS threat and the President's proposed plan to fight it!	10154596023185597

6355254859	Freedom of expression has again been attacked by fanatics. From the capitals of Europe to the streets of Garland, Texas, we have been confronted by attackers who cannot tolerate our open society. But we send a clear message to these extremists: we will not be intimidated by violence, and we will not bow down to terror.	10153299472879860

6355254859	Prime Minister Netanyahu delivered a powerful speech and a compelling argument for why the Iran nuclear deal is dangerous for the national security of both Israel and the United States. The Prime Minister is correct, ISIS and Iran are competing for the crown of militant Islam, we cannot allow either to succeed in its goal. I continue to stand with Israel against what is most certainly a bad deal for the U.S., Israel, and the security of the entire Middle East region and call for President Obama to recognize the threat for what it is.	10153140897624860
6355254859	The announcement that the US District court has ruled against the president’s unconstitutional executive amnesty orders reinforces what President Obama said 22 times - he does not have the authority to ignore the law. I applaud this ruling and urge the President to recognize that he must work with Congress to secure our border and follow the rule of law when it comes to interior enforcement. Furthermore, Senate Democrats who claim to oppose the president’s executive actions on immigration should immediately stop playing political games and let the Senate begin debate on a Department of Homeland Security funding bill.	10153107006649860
6355254859	Thank you to Governor Greg Abbott for declaring today Chris Kyle Day. Kyle was an American hero and we are grateful for his service and sacrifices he made during his life.	10153069840304860

203482063021985	Thanks to everyone who came out to the town hall meetings today. I really enjoyed getting to hear about the issues that are most important to the constituents of the 11th district. I'll be in Eden, Texas tomorrow at the Multi-Purpose Center at 3:30 PM for the last town hall meeting of the week. I hope to see you there.	825952294108289
6355254859	I joined Congressman Bob Goodlatte in issuing a statement on our efforts to improve border security and interior enforcement. \n\n"For decades, Americans have been promised that our borders will be secured and our immigration laws will be enforced. But these promises have not been kept: our border remains porous and our immigration laws have not been fully enforced by presidents of both parties.\n\nHouse Republicans are taking a step-by-step approach to deliver on these long-overdue promises made to the American people so that we gain operational control of our borders and guarantee that our immigration laws will be enforced moving forward. The Secure Our Border First Act is the first step and will move our nation closer to gaining control of our borders so that we thwart national security threats and stop illegal border crossers from coming to the U.S.\n\nAs chairmen of the House Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees, we join our colleagues to secure our borders and ensure our immigration laws are not unilaterally ignored by President Obama and future presidents. We will continue working on these issues and the Judiciary Committee will work on legislation to deliver results on interior enforcement, such as mandatory electronic verification of employment eligibility, addressing fraud in the asylum system, and allowing state and local law enforcement to help in enforcing our laws."	10153043052569860
6355254859	Today, along with 235 of my colleagues, I voted to block funding to the President’s unilateral and unconstitutional executive amnesty. I supported the legislation because I agree with my constituents who are overwhelmingly opposed to the President’s actions. I hope the Senate will also pass the legislation and send a resounding message to the President that the American people and their representatives are opposed to not only his policies, but his desire to govern unilaterally. \n\nLike this post if you agree!	10153027376504860
6355254859	I want to wish the best of luck to some of my young constituents at Katy High School as they compete for the 6A DII State Championship! #katyfootball #txhsfb	10152936081004860
6355254859	Today I sent a letter to the President telling him that the American people rejected his policies last week and that includes this Obama Amnesty he wants to announce this week. I stand against amnesty in all forms. You can read my letter here: http://1.usa.gov/1xpK1N1 \n\nLike this post if you agree with me NO OBAMA AMNESTY!	10152870329174860
6355254859	Tonight in my district (TX10) Tomball High School is honoring the 1984-1985 Football Team on their 30th anniversary of the Cougars 1984 run for the State Championship! I want to wish both the Tomball Cougars and Brenham Cubs a great and safe game, and join them in honoring the ’84 Cougars!	10152813210549860
6355254859	Today Austin remembers Deputy Jessica Hollis whose life was cut tragically short. In honor of her service and dedication to her community, I have donated a flag in her memory to her family.	10152738183084860
6355254859	The bills passed by the House today are the best chance we have to stop this crisis in months, not years. Changing current law to ensure the swift and humane return of those who come to the United States illegally is the only way to stop the exploitation of these children and stem the flow. It is also vital that we address the immediate border security concerns created by this surge by providing additional funding and state reimbursement for the deployment of the National Guard to the border. I am pleased the House also passed a measure to end the enticement created by DACA, the Administration’s failed executive action which grants immigration benefits to individuals outside of the law, by preventing the President from using Federal funds or resources to continue or expand the program.	10152607746544860
6355254859	I support Governor Rick Perry's intentions to send up to 1,000 National Guardsmen to the border as a force multiplier and to act as a deterrent to further illegal crossings into the United States. \n\nThe use of our National Guard as a force multiplier is long overdue, and something I have called for in my border security bill as part of a strategy to help the Border Patrol gain operational control of the Southwest Border. I applaud Governor Perry for once again doing what is within his authority to secure our borders while this president continues to abdicate his constitutional responsibility.	10152581443359860
6355254859	The Supreme Court's ruling in the Hobby Lobby case is a victory for our Constitution and those who oppose government overreach into private healthcare decisions.  ObamaCare is the most egregious example of this administration’s desire to impose its big government policy agenda on the American people.  I call on the President to acknowledge the problems inherent in the law, listen to the American people, and work with Congress to pass healthcare reforms that will bring down costs, expand coverage and, most importantly, keep the federal government out of healthcare decisions.	10152533880569860
203482063021985	I will be holding a town hall meeting in Mineral Wells, Texas tomorrow morning, Friday, June 19.

203482063021985	Some of my staff members in DC were able to join the Permian Basin Honor Flight at the National World War II Memorial this afternoon and shared some of the pictures with me. Colonel Michael Downs, who is the incoming wing commander at Goodfellow Air Force Base, was also able to come and speak with the veterans. I am looking forward to meeting the group on Saturday!	834227463280772
203482063021985	Today, we take the time to remember the many men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could remain a free nation. Thank you to all who have served, are currently serving, and your families. Our nation is forever indebted to you.	832878263415692
203482063021985	This weekend, thousands of men and women rode their motorcycles around Washington DC to salute U.S. veterans as part  of the Rolling Thunder Ride for Freedom. Suzanne and I watched the rally near the Capitol, and she took some great photos. It's important that we take the time to honor America's fallen heroes on Memorial Day, and this was a great salute to all those who served our great nation.	832333470136838

203482063021985	Every child deserves to be protected and right now, that’s not always the case. The House of Representatives just passed legislation I cosponsored that takes on the important task of defending the defenseless: pain-capable unborn children. There is nothing more important than respect for the sanctity of life and I am glad to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.	828279417208910
49640749719	Yesterday, I received the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence at an event hosted by NAM member Williams RDM in Fort Worth.\n\nManufacturers in Texas account for 15 percent of the total output in Texas, employing 7.5 percent of the workforce.	10153153920189720
203482063021985	Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015, authored by fellow Texan Rep. Kevin Brady. As a CPA, I know from experience that the Death Tax hurts individuals who have worked hard and saved all of their lives in order to build up a nest egg for themselves and their families. \n\nFarmers and ranchers are hit especially hard, because their assets are primarily land and equipment.  When a farmer or rancher passes away, even though he has already paid taxes on everything he owns, the sons and daughters who want to carry on the family tradition will first have to get over the hurdle of a whopping tax penalty that can reach as high as 60 percent. The death tax hurts not only that next generation of farmers and ranchers, but it hobbles an important sector of our economy that creates economic activity and jobs.  A repeal of the death tax is long overdue.	815657541804431
203482063021985	Today on Tax Day, Americans have to comply with over 70,000 pages that make up the current tax code. And every year, more and more regulations get added- Obamacare alone added 3,300 pages to the already overly complicated tax code. There’s no doubt that our tax system is out of control and in desperate need of reform. I support the FairTax Act, which would replace all federal taxes on income, including everything from payroll taxes to the estate tax, with a single national retail sales tax. Best of all, under the FairTax plan, the IRS is no longer needed. The IRS has overreached and invaded the personal lives of Americans for too long and has created a monstrous tax code. The people of this country will be better off without it.	815126311857554
203482063021985	This Easter, we honor the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter is a time for thoughtful reflection and celebration. As we spend time with our families this weekend, take time to enjoy their company and remember the sacrifices that were made for us. Easter always reminds me to honor those individuals that have laid down their lives for another. \n\nNo matter what belief system you hold, striving to live by a higher moral code will bring good into the world, strengthen our communities, and lay a solid foundation for the future of our children and grandchildren. Take time to pray for our troops who aren't with their families this Easter, for those who are currently without work, and for those overseas who are being persecuted. Suzanne and I wish you and your families a very happy Easter.	809467769090075
203482063021985	For those in Breckenridge who are currently without water, the city is offering free water at the police station. Thanks to all who are working day and night to get this issue resolved.	798582516845267
203482063021985	Tuesday, I will be holding a town hall meeting in Colorado City that is open to the public. It will take place at the Mitchell County Hospital- East Tower at  997 West Interstate 20, Colorado City, from 9:30 AM-10:30 AM. I always enjoy talking to constituents and learning more about what issues are most important to you. Please join me if you are able to!	795437100493142
203482063021985	As many of you saw, I voted against the Department of Homeland Security funding bill that passed yesterday. Earlier in the year, I supported the legislation passed by the House of Representatives to fund DHS and prevent the President’s illegal amnesty plan from being enacted. However, I could not support the legislation that passed yesterday because it does nothing to address President Obama’s unconstitutional executive action to grant amnesty to five million illegal immigrants.\n\nEvery attempt that the Republicans in the House of Representatives made to conference with the Senate on this funding bill was met with indifference by obstructionist Senate Democrats. Democratic Senators prevented this legislation from even being debated until hours before the Department of Homeland Security was set to shut down. Our nation was built on a system of checks and balances. The President himself said 22 times that he did not have the legal authority to act on immigration in the way that he ultimately did. A federal judge in Texas agreed with the President, and blocked his illegal amnesty plan from moving forward for now.\n\nI am deeply concerned by the lack of principle coming from the White House and the Senate Democrats who put the country in this position. I am hopeful that our courts will uphold the decision made by the U.S. District Judge in Brownsville and find that the President has grossly overreached his constitutional authority, and that his illegal amnesty plan is indeed illegal.	794463817257137
203482063021985	I'm in Brownwood for a town hall meeting this morning. If you're in the area, stop by the Brownwood Chamber of Commerce at 600 E. Depot St from 9:00- 10:00 AM. I hope to see you there!	788334437870075

203482063021985	Yesterday, I was deeply saddened to learn that my dear friend Congressman Alan Nunnelee passed away. Congressman Nunnelee sat on the House Agriculture Committee with me, and I saw him work hard on behalf of the constituents in Mississippi's 1st District throughout his time in Congress. His strong faith in God was admirable, and he and his family are in my and Suzanne's prayers during this extraordinarily difficult time.	783599341676918
203482063021985	Governor Abbott has declared today Chris Kyle Day in honor of Chris Kyle's dedication and service to our country. Born in Odessa, Texas, Kyle joined the Navy SEALS in 1999 and served four tours in Iraq, saving the lives of hundreds, and possibly thousands, of American soldiers. Today we honor the memory of Chris Kyle, a true American hero. His commitment to our nation and the great sacrifices he made will never be forgotten.	781671068536412

7760165627	The cold-blooded, intentional murder of 132 school children by terrorists in Pakistan, as well as the death of at least 15 children in a bombing in Yemen yesterday is a strong reminder of the unimaginable evil that we face and that the civilized world must unite against.	10153006674230628
203482063021985	Last November, President Obama wrongly granted amnesty to as many as five million illegal immigrants through an unlawful executive action. His decision to circumvent the proper legislative process was not the right way to handle this, and the President himself even admitted that he did not have the legal authority to act on immigration in this way. I made a promise to my constituents that one of the first things we would do this Congress would be to prevent the President’s unconstitutional executive action from becoming our nation’s new immigration policy. Today, the House of Representatives passed legislation to do just that.\n\nIn addition, the bill we passed today provides Customs and Border Protection with enough funding to support the greatest number of Border Patrol agents and officers that we have ever seen, and provides them with the technologies they need to ensure the surveillance of air, land and sea approaches to our border. The Coast Guard will also be protected from the cuts proposed by the President that would have greatly harmed operational abilities, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement will see an increase in funding for detention programs and resources to investigate criminal activity. This bill prioritizes spending in a way that will ultimately help protect our country. It is imperative that the Senate now pass this legislation to stop the President’s unconstitutional actions and to give the needed support to the men and women who protect our borders.	773402262696626
203482063021985	The agreement announced today is a poorly negotiated deal for America and for the Cuban people.  We have given up significant leverage in exchange for few tangible benefits for our country or the average Cuban.  As far as I can see, this deal makes no significant gains on either democratization or increasing respect for human rights in a country where the government controls every single aspect of life.\nI have long been a supporter of relaxing agricultural trade restrictions with Cuba and providing humanitarian support for the Cuban people.  However, the policies currently in place created advantages that the President has simply given away with this deal and will serve largely to enrich the leaders of Cuba.  \nThe original embargo imposed by President Kennedy and the Cuban Democracy Act was of 1992 was explicitly intended to maintain sanctions on Cuba until the government moved toward ‘democratization and greater respect for human rights.’  Neither of these goals has been achieved with this deal. \nThe President has yet again damaged America’s ability to use negotiations to make positive changes around the world.	758695800833939
203482063021985	The Fiscal Year 2015 spending bill was a flawed bill which I opposed for a multitude of reasons including the fact that it did not include restrictive language that would have hindered the President’s amnesty plan.  I look forward to continuing the House’s fight against the plan.  I have a commitment from our Republican leadership that this process will begin in mid-January.  By that time, we will have a Republican controlled Senate.  It will still be a challenge to reverse the President’s executive order, but my Republican colleagues and I will not give up this fight.  \nThere were a lot of good things in the bill such as cutting millions of dollars from the EPA and IRS budgets and cutting EPA staffing back to 1989 levels, but unfortunately the problems with the bill outweighed the good. These fiscally conservative provisions are indicative of the work we will do in the 114th Congress.	756516367718549
203482063021985	Two provisions that I worked on were included in the Fiscal Year 2015 Defense Authorization Bill, which the House passed this week. One provision would require the Department of Defense to award Purple Hearts to soldiers killed in the 2009 Fort Hood shootings. I offered this amendment on behalf of Congressman John Carter (R-TX31) and Congressman Roger Williams (R-TX25), who are not on the House Armed Services Committee. As we know too well, the battlefield in the War on Terror is not limited to foreign lands. Men and women who defend America against terrorism on American soil, should be eligible to receive the Purple Heart and other medals that recognize their heroism and sacrifice. It also includes two provisions I authored that would prohibit large-scale purchases of biofuels unless they are cost competitive with traditional fuels, and require the department to submit a case analysis to Congress before constructing a biofuel refinery. These provisions are necessary at a time when our military is already facing enormous budget constraints. It is not the job of the Department of Defense to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to develop the biofuel industry when these monies could go toward service member training and readiness. While I am happy this bill passed the House, the Senate now needs to pass it and the President needs to sign it. Furthermore, we need the President’s leadership in rolling back the across the board cuts that are damaging our military and threatening our national security.	753713704665482
203482063021985	Today we are debating a bill, H.R. 1422, that would improve the quality of the science that the EPA is using and increase transparency.  The bill would reform the Agency's Science Advisory Boards.  The bill would: \n-Prevent involvement by people with conflicts of interests;\n-Require communications of uncertainties in scientific findings;\n-Limit non-scientific policy advice.\nThese Scientific Advisory Boards must be fair, transparent & independent.	746128582090661

49640749719	Members of Congress Announce the Launch of Bipartisan Taskforce on Anti-Semitism\n\n(Washington, DC) - Today, U.S. Reps. Chris Smith (NJ-04), Nita Lowey (NY-17), Eliot Engel (NY-16), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL-27), Kay Granger (TX-12), Steve Israel (NY-03), Peter Roskam (IL-06), and Ted Deutch (FL-21) announced the launch of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism in the House of Representatives. Together, these Members will serve as co-Chairs of the Taskforce in the 114th Congress and spearhead initiatives aimed at addressing the alarming rise of anti-Semitism around the world.\n\nThe Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism was formed in order to ensure that Congress plays an integral role in condemning anti-Semitism and promoting tolerance worldwide.\n\nThe Taskforce will serve as a forum for educating Members on this distinct form of intolerance and to engage with the Executive Branch, foreign leaders, and civil society organizations for the sharing of best practices and cooperating on solutions to rebuff this disturbing trend. It will also promote Holocaust Remembrance in concert with exploring innovative ways to teach tolerance and confront hate.\n\nThe co-Chairs issued the following joint statement:\n\n“Around the world, we are witnessing an alarming rise of anti-Semitism that is dangerous and complex. Over the past few years, Jewish schools, synagogues, and even homes and property have been targets of anti-Semitic violence. Jewish populations are facing increased levels of hatred, frequently under the guise of political differences or other alibis, but in reality it is solely because of their faith. It is the responsibility of everyone who believes in basic universal liberties and freedoms to condemn this trend and work together to root out the hatred which underlies anti-Semitism. We look forward to working with our colleagues in Congress to find innovative solutions that match the 21st century face of this age-old bigotry.”	10153119441449720
49640749719	My e-newsletter that went out today regarding the vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nEarlier this week Congress acted to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the end of the current fiscal year. Under no circumstances was I going to let DHS shut down.\n\nThe threats facing the United States today are as serious as they were immediately before September 11th, 2001. I do not believe that shutting down the department that oversees transportation security, border security and critical counterterrorism efforts would be in the best interest of our country.\n\nUnfortunately, there is some misinformation about the bill in terms of what was actually funded. The bill that was signed into law did not provide any funding for President Obama’s illegal executive actions on immigration. The funding for implementation of his executive actions is not appropriated by Congress. The funding for the President’s actions would come from fees paid by immigrants who are seeking legal status. Therefore, the office in DHS tasked with carrying out his actions would remain open whether or not DHS was shut down. President Obama would have to voluntarily rescind his executive actions or he would have to sign legislation into law doing so and he is not going to take either course of action.\n\nA few weeks ago a Texas court issued an order blocking the President’s unconstitutional executive actions from being carried out. This ruling proves that the President’s actions were illegal. I believe the legal system is the best chance to permanently stop the executive actions from being implemented.\n\nI have never agreed with the President’s illegal executive actions on immigration. I continue to believe that more should be done to stop his unconstitutional overreach of presidential authority, but I do not believe shutting down a vital part of homeland security accomplishes that goal; especially when it would not hold the President accountable or stop his executive actions from being implemented.	10153072700794720
49640749719	Here is my latest e-newsletter. \n\nDear Friend,\n\nI wanted to share the news with you about an award I received earlier this week. On Thursday, I was recognized with the “True Blue” award by Family Research Council (FRC) Action for my 100 percent voting record on pro-life and pro-family legislation they tracked during the last Congress.\n\nDuring the awards presentation, I had the chance to visit with Family Research Council president Tony Perkins who presented me with their award and other Members of Congress who also received this honor.\n\nThe key pieces of legislation they monitored included pro-life votes, like the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, and voting in favor of amendments to delay implementation of the president’s health care law and ensure it includes religious conscience protections.\n\nSincerely,\nKay Granger	10153027348019720

49640749719	My reaction to President Obama's State of the Union address.\n\n“The tone for the year ahead should be one that enables the country to move forward. The American people have chosen divided government, but not a stalemate between the White House and Congress. The focus should be on continued economic recovery and job creation, providing for our national security, taking care of our veterans, and reestablishing strong American leadership abroad.\n\n“There needs to be a renewed emphasis on how Washington can create a vibrant economic environment. This should include eliminating excessive regulations, putting the federal budget on a path toward balance, and establishing new trade partners so American products can be sold to more marketplaces abroad. Reforming the burdensome tax code for both individuals and small businesses is vital to growing the economy. I adamantly oppose tax increases to pay for more government spending as the president has outlined. We need real tax reform that lowers rates, creates jobs, and rewards hard work and success. We have started to see new life in the U.S. economy, but there is still a long road ahead to full recovery and Washington should take this opportunity to expand growth, not restrict it. \n\n“I continue to oppose the president’s approach to the use of executive authority. President Obama understands well the frustration Congress has with his decision to govern almost exclusively by executive action. The president should work with the new Congress, not circumvent the legislative process.\n\n“Fighting and stopping terrorism, both domestically and abroad, must be a top priority for the U.S. for the year ahead to ensure our citizens remain safe. I believe reestablishing strong leadership abroad is critical to counterterrorism efforts around the world. This means standing firm when the U.S. makes a commitment. This also includes standing with our allies and standing up to our aggressors. In turn, it is the responsibility of the federal government to fulfill the promise made to all our veterans that we will take care of them once they return home. The federal government hasn’t lived up to that promise very well lately and more needs to be done to ensure this is a promise our country never breaks again.”	10152973323974720

49640749719	My statement today regarding the votes in the House to defund President Obama's immigration executive actions: \n\n“Today, the House responded to the unprecedented and unconstitutional actions President Obama took in November to change our country’s immigration laws without the consent of Congress. By fully defunding the executive orders the House has taken an important step in stopping President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration from being implemented. The president’s egregious executive orders on immigration have only created more loopholes in an already complicated immigration system, which is why the president shouldn’t be legislating via executive action.\n\n“In addition to taking steps to stop President Obama’s immigration executive actions, the House fully funded the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of the fiscal year. This bipartisan bill includes critical funding for Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as agencies dedicated to counterterrorism. The recent terrorist attacks in Paris are a reminder that we must remain vigilant against the threat of terrorist acts on American soil, which is why this bill makes important investments to keep our country safe.\n\n“The bill provides for the largest operational force in history with 21,370 Border Patrol agents and 23,775 Customs and Border Protection officers to fully support efforts to protect our borders. It is the fundamental responsibility of the federal government to protect the homeland and that includes a robust effort to secure our borders.”	10152960267589720

This epidemic and the recent news that two health care professionals in Dallas have tested positive for the disease deserves a serious and immediate response.  \n\nThat is why I find it shameful that an organization has decided to run television ads across the country accusing myself and other Members of Congress of being responsible for cutting funding for Ebola research.

49640749719	Yesterday, I presented to the House GOP Conference the recommendations of the Border Crisis working group. These recommendations reflect the immediate crisis this country faces by providing common-sense, compassionate, but tough solutions.\n\nRecommendations and Solutions:\n\n•Deploy the National Guard to the Southern border to assist Border Patrol in the humanitarian care and needs of the unaccompanied minors. This will free up the Border Patrol to focus on their primary mission. \n\n•Prohibit the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) from denying or restricting U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) activities on federal land under their respective jurisdictions.\n\n•Require a DHS strategy and implementation plan to gain operational control of the Southwest border.  \n\n•Establish independent third party commission to develop border security metrics as a means to accurately gauge progress on border security.\n\n•Establish border security in Central American countries and Mexico.\n\n•Establish repatriation centers in originating countries in order to facilitate the return of family units and unaccompanied minors.  \n\n•Deploy aggressive messaging campaigns in originating countries and the U.S. to dispel immigration myths, clarify that individuals will be deported on arrival and advise on the dangers and legal penalties of traveling through Mexico to enter the United States illegally.  \n\n•Mandate the detention of all Family Units apprehended at the border with the ultimate goal of processing family units 5-7 days. Congress must continue stringent oversight to ensure this mandate is being met.\n\n•Amend the Trafficking Victims Protection and Reauthorization Act of 2008 so all unaccompanied minors are treated the same as Mexicans for the purpose of removals. This would require unaccompanied children who do not wish to be voluntarily returned to their home country to remain in HHS custody while they await an expedited immigration court hearing that must occur not more than 7 days after they are screened by child welfare officials.  \n\n•Deploy additional judge teams and temporary judges to expedite the hearing of asylum and credible fear claims. Congress must address the occurrences of fraud in our asylum system. Baseless claims crowd the immigration court system and delay processing for those with legitimate claims. The standard under current law that allows an alien to show a "credible fear of persecution" needs to be examined and addressed to ensure a fraud-free system moving forward.  In addition, criminal aliens and criminal gang members should not receive asylum.\n\n•Establish tough penalties for those engaged in human smuggling, including the smuggling of unaccompanied minors by strengthening penalties for human smugglers and those who assist them.\n\n•Increase law enforcement operations domestically and in originating countries to disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and encourage originating countries to pass strict laws against human smuggling.	10152540726319720

49640749719	After meeting today, the Speaker’s working group issued the following statement regarding the humanitarian and national security crisis at the southern border. The working group will provide the first update to the House GOP Conference on Tuesday, July 15. The Members of the working group include: myself, Chairman Bob Goodlatte (VA), Chairman Michael McCaul (TX), Chairman John Carter (TX), Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart (FL), Congressman Steve Pearce (NM), and Congressman Matt Salmon (AZ).\n\n“As the Speaker’s working group to address the crisis at the southern border we are extremely concerned over the well-being of children who cross our borders alone, as well as the integrity of our immigration laws. That is why the President must act to deter parents from encouraging their children to make this horrific and perilous journey based on the hope that they will be able to stay in the United States. The policies of the current Administration have created the crisis we are currently facing at our southern border and it will take Presidential action to solve it.\n\n“We agree with the President that they must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible and that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. In addition, the FY 2015 appropriations process is already under way in the House which addresses resources related to the current crisis. The substantial increase of family units and unaccompanied children crossing the border has created an enormous strain on Customs and Border Protection as well as the border states and communities. It is critical we ensure that the Border Patrol is able to focus on protecting the borders of the United States.\n\n“Over the next several days we will review the facts and continue to gather on-the-ground information in order to develop a series of recommendations regarding actions the Administration can take within its authority as well as legislative solutions for the Congress to consider to address this crisis.”	10152509749674720
49640749719	My statement regarding White House emergency funding request for the southern border:\n\nWASHINGTON, DC – Congresswoman Kay Granger (TX-12), Chairwoman of the House Working Group to address the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, issued the following statement regarding the White House emergency funding request for the southern border.\n\n“I, along with the members of the Appropriations Committee and working group, look forward to reviewing the White House supplemental request to address the humanitarian and national security crisis at the southern border. After two visits to the Texas-Mexico border and detention facilities around Texas last week, I saw firsthand how dire the situation is for the thousands of unaccompanied minors who are making the dangerous journey from Central American to the U.S. border. The huge increase of unaccompanied children crossing the border has created an enormous strain on the Border Patrol as well as the Texas Department of Public Safety and its vital to their missions that they are provided with the resources they need to protect the southern border.\n  \n“The Speaker's working group will meet again tomorrow to discuss the humanitarian, security, and immigration issues surrounding the situation at the southern border, as well as the policy steps we believe Congress and the Administration should take provide solutions to this immediate crisis."\n\nOver the last week, Granger has visited a bus station in Laredo, TX that is providing shelter and aid for dozens of family units every day while they await transportation to take them to locations across the country to appear before an immigration court; the Customs and Border Patrol facility in McAllen, TX where hundreds of unaccompanied minors and family units are apprehended while they await to be processed through the system; and Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX that is serving as a temporary shelter and processing center for thousands of unaccompanied minors.\n\nGranger also participated in Chairman Michael McCaul’s Homeland Security Committee field hearing that was held in McAllen, TX last week. On Monday, Granger toured and met with officials at Catholic Charities Fort Worth who have provided shelter and aid for approximately 200 unaccompanied children to date.\n\nThe Working Group will provide the first update to the House GOP Conference on July 15, 2014.	10152507672054720

49640749719	My statement from this morning calling for VA Secretary Shinseki to step down:\n\nWASHINGTON, DC – Congresswoman Kay Granger (TX-12) issued the following statement after the release of the interim Inspector General Report regarding the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System.\n\n“The findings of the IG report are inexcusable. This report backs up the allegations of a systematic failure at the VA and shows criminal type behavior took place to conceal wait times and deny veterans the health care they are owed and deserve. All those involved must be held accountable for these reprehensible actions of mismanagement and neglect that have put too many lives at risk.\n\n“I have lost faith in the current leadership at the VA. At this point, I don’t see how Secretary Shinseki can continue to serve as the head of this vast and what has become a dysfunctional bureaucracy. The activities that have been allowed to take place are disgraceful, and I believe Secretary Shinseki should resign immediately. \n\n“Our veterans deserve to have a capable manager who can restore trust and begin to repair the VA from top to bottom. Our veterans were promised a health care system that would provide them with the best care in the world, it is clear the current leadership has failed to live up to that standard.”	10152414830364720

7760165627	This week, the House passed two bills that will help bolster our nation’s ability to protect against cyber-attacks.  Both bills are based on recommendations from a Cybersecurity Task Force that I led in 2011.  Republicans in the House have passed similar cybersecurity legislation in every session of congress since that time, and I hope our colleagues in the Senate will soon do the same. The threats we face in the cyber world today have become far more aggressive, their attacks more frequent, and their capabilities more sophisticated than they were just five years ago. Our country's security and economy depend on taking action now.	10153368823245628
7760165627	Last week, I traveled with some other Armed Service Committee members to Romania, Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania. We met with the president and defense minister of each country as well as other officials. We also met with U.S. and allied military leaders in the region and dozens of U.S. military personnel. Everywhere we went, we found great concern about Russia and great appreciation for the United States. The trip strengthened my view that we should provide appropriate weapons to Ukraine so they are better able to defend themselves.	10153327805780628

Sometimes we forget all the hard work that goes into producing the food we buy at the grocery store, but a lot of folks from our area play an important role in making sure that food gets from farm or ranch to our tables.  It was good to meet this week with some of those folks from the Texas Farm Bureau and Texas Cattle Feeders Association.	10153293214380628

7760165627	On January 14th, the House passed, and I voted for, H.R. 240,  a DHS Appropriations bill that included several important amendments to stop the President’s executive actions that exempt around 4 million illegal immigrants from our nation’s laws. Since then, that legislation has been held up in the Senate by Harry Reid and the Democrats who have prevented it from even coming to the floor for a debate or vote.\n \nYesterday, the Senate passed its version of the DHS funding bill so that we can finally proceed to conference and work out the differences between the two bills. That is how the legislative process is supposed to work under the framework that our Founding Fathers created. To provide enough time for that to happen, the House passed a one-week DHS funding bill last night. There are too many threats facing our nation to play politics with our national security, and our Constitution is too important to allow the President’s actions to go uncontested.	10153207537130628
7760165627	I was pleased that a federal judge in Texas yesterday put a temporary halt to the implementation of the President's executive action that would fail to enforce part of our immigration law.  We need to fix our broken immigration system. But the issue here is even bigger than immigration. It is about the rule of law and whether any president can pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce.	10153182973720628
7760165627	This week the House passed three commonsense bills, each of which President Obama threatened to veto.  One, which also has passed the Senate, authorized the Keystone XL Pipeline.  Another incentivizes businesses to contribute excess inventory to local food banks and pantries. The third made permanent the Section 179 deduction that is so important to small businesses of all kinds, allowing them to expense up to $500,000 a year on equipment purchases.  Each of them is good for the country and passed with bipartisan support.	10153172904000628

7760165627	Today, the President proposed a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against ISIL. ISIL is at war with the United States and the civilized world. The President has taken the right step by requesting an AUMF. I have concerns about how the proposal the President has put forward will enable our military commanders to degrade and defeat ISIL. \n\nIn making his request months after military action against ISIL has started, the President must tell the American people why an AUMF is necessary. He must explain his strategy for success. He must detail where the resources will come from to achieve that success. He must explain how the military can operate within the restrictions he has suggested. And he should explain why he is seeking to tie his own hands by limiting authority that he’s already claimed. \n\nHe must also assure the American people and our allies around the world that his heart is in the fight.

7760165627	Today, the House passed bipartisan legislation to expand liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The Energy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will become a net exporter of natural gas before 2020, and new LNG export projects are estimated to generate 45,000 more jobs by 2018. Exporting LNG is economically and geopolitically beneficial for the U.S. and our allies.	10153137072130628
7760165627	Today, I voted for the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill (HR 240) that included several important anti-amnesty amendments that defund the President’s Executive overreach on immigration and also stop DACA – the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program – from granting deferred action to millions of illegal immigrants. Furthermore, this bill boosts border security and interior enforcement, which is especially important for Texas and the overall security of our nation.	10153106427175628

7760165627	It is deeply disturbing that the President has chosen not to enforce the law of the land.  Whatever one’s views on what the law should be – and I believe immigration laws are need of a major overhaul – the law must be respected and enforced.\n \nA true leader would work with Congress to change the law, as past presidents have done.  President Obama’s arrogant, go-it-alone attitude and this action undermine the rule of law and make it more difficult to solve other problems that face us. \n \nCongress is looking at a variety of options to limit the damage done by this announcement and to reverse it.	10152945766205628

7760165627	Last night, I spoke to the Panhandle Chapter of Christians United for Israel at St. Stephen United Methodist Church about the state of America’s national security and the importance of our friendship with Israel, our nation’s strongest ally in the Middle East.  From the growth of terrorism to possible Iranian nuclear weapons, both the U.S. and Israel face major threats from around the world, making it that much more important to stand together and in support of our longtime friend.	10152880835335628

However, there is hope that we will not have to wait any longer on the President...\n\nYesterday, we passed a provision that would not require the Presidential permit to start this project.

128891177274584	ICYMI: My statement from last night after the President's speech.\n\n"The President's speech tonight was encouraging. While it is not often I side with the President, I do agree we must annihilate the Islamic State. However, a succinct plan would be in our best interest. I suggest the following: \n\n1. Build a consensus of the American people through their elected Representatives in Congress instead of going around them.\n2. Build a coalition of the global and neighborhood community, especially countries in the region who stand to lose the most.\n3. Un-handcuff the American military and annihilate the Islamic State with "Shock and Awe".\n4. Set up an exit strategy with the neighborhood community, as they will be the maintenance forces.\n5. Do not hold strategy sessions in the media.\n\nWe already lost two American journalists at the hands of these barbarians, and tomorrow morning we will all awake to the anniversary of the September 11th attacks on US soil and against our people in Benghazi. These events in our history are reminders that there are those in the world that hate the United States and our cherished freedoms."	342923282538038

402891225161	A special note on this day in Texas history. Being a Longhorn, I consider today a special day, but I have to say that my wife Marty may not be as enthused, being that she is an Aggie. Here is why this day is significant to me and to other UT graduates. \n\nMay 12th, 1903 -- University of Texas anthem premiers in Austin\nOn this day in 1903, "The Eyes of Texas" was first sung. The performance took place at a minstrel show benefiting the University of Texas track team at the Hancock Opera House in Austin. The ditty soon became the official song of the University of Texas, and is even considered by some a sort of unofficial state song. (Such enthusiasts are rare at College Station.) William L. Prather, an alumnus of Washington College (Lexington, Virginia) and president of UT from 1899 to 1905, had often in his student days heard Robert E. Lee, then president of Washington College, say to students, "The eyes of the South are upon you." Prather altered the saying for use at UT.	10155519884095162

Today, 51 years after this historic occasion, we continue to honor all of those that courageously fought and lost their lives in the Civil Rights Movement, and who never lost sight of their dream of a free nation.	10154500297525162
402891225161	Our congratulations go to Mario Luis Ramirez of McAllen, Texas who was chosen as one of fifteen White House Fellows for 2014-2015! Selection as a White House Fellow is highly competitive and based on a record of professional achievement, evidence of leadership potential, and a proven commitment to public service. Each Fellow must possess the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute meaningfully at senior levels in the Federal government. Throughout its history, the program has fostered leaders in many fields, including leaders in government, business, law, media, medicine, education, diplomacy, and the military.\nMario Luis Ramirez, is an emergency medicine physician who most recently served in the United States Air Force as a Major and led a Critical Care Air Transport Team based at Bagram, Afghanistan from 2012-2013.  He and his crew were credited with evacuating over 50 gravely ill and injured service members and were recognized with several medals and citations.  Prior to his Air Force commission, he served on the teaching faculty at Vanderbilt University, and was a special instructor at the Nashville Police Academy where he helped to develop an innovative first aid program credited with improving medical care for police officers.  He has published several scientific papers, edited a textbook on pre-hospital preparedness, and privately consulted to municipal special operations police units. Mario is board certified in emergency medicine and completed a residency and EMS fellowship at Vanderbilt University. He received his B.S. in biology from Stanford University, M.D. from Harvard Medical School, and a Masters in Public Policy from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, where his area of focus was chemical weapons policy in the Middle East.  We wish Mario all the best in this outstanding opportunity!	10154492626915162

460776160654909	Last week the House passed H.R. 2685, a funding bill for the Department of Defense by a vote of 278-149. I opposed this bill because it funds our national security in an unsustainable manner that will weaken our ability to fund both the military and our other priorities for years to come.\n\nOver the last few years, Congress has funded our military in two ways: through a base budget, and a war account. The base budget is subject to the spending caps set several years ago by the Budget Control Act (BCA). The war account (which was intended to only be spent on our overseas wars) is not subject to these caps, and was presumed to decrease as our involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan decreased.\n\nHowever, in order to evade budget controls, Congress has been funding base operations out of the account meant for unforeseen contingencies of war. That results in adding more money into the war account to pay for non-war activities including research and training, among others. \n\nWhile I support many of these programs, we must pay for them honestly and sustainability using the base budget. If we continue to pay for non-war items using our yearly war account, the DOD will have difficulty forecasting how much funding they will get for many important programs. This uncertainty makes carrying out critical missions much more difficult, and diminishes our ability to intelligently invest in the people, systems and strategies that will allow us to pursue our national security priorities.\n\nI support removing the budget caps and taking a responsible approach to funding defense rather than through a temporary war account.	972788086120378

460776160654909	Here's the bottom line: we currently trade with all of the countries with which TPA will give the President the authority to negotiate, and today they have almost unfettered access to our economy (U.S. tariffs with most are near-zero and their tariffs on our goods are as high as 70%). Today's vote on TPA gives us a chance to regulate trade that is already ongoing in a way that provides more opportunities for more of our workers to produce goods that will reach more markets -- and do so in a way that improves the quality of jobs and the environment. It's a chance for El Paso to capitalize on its growing status as a leading trade community and to push us to take the important steps necessary to add greater value to the commerce (over $90 billion a year) that moves through our ports.\n\n ----   \n\nI voted today to give the President the authority to continue negotiations with our trading partners around the world on an expedited basis, which will limit the ability of Congress to amend any deals that he reaches. In return for that limitation, the vote for Trade Promotion Authority (or TPA) forces the President to meet the objectives and conditions that Congress has set for the negotiations. These include the most ambitious labor and environmental safeguards of any trade deal this country has negotiated, as well as requirements for transparency, anti-corruption practices and ensuring that U.S.-made exports find their way to consumers in the nations that comprise 40% of the world's GDP. The bill also requires the President to bring any negotiated agreement back to Congress, where we and the American people will have at least 90 days to review the text before making a decision to support or reject it.\n \nIn listening to you before I made my decision I have heard many concerns about TPP (the Trans Pacific Partnership). This is a proposed free trade agreement with 12 Pacific nations (including the U.S.), which, if negotiated to conclusion, would have to be brought back to Congress for approval or rejection. \n \nYou have raised important questions about labor protections, about environmental safeguards, about protecting public health in this country and in the countries with whom we trade. You have questioned whether this will help or hurt jobs in El Paso and throughout the country. You have reminded me that NAFTA exacted a tremendous toll on this community; that following NAFTA's passage over twenty years ago, tens of thousands of people lost their jobs, that whole industries and careers and ways of life were wiped out; and that there is the very real danger that we might repeat the same mistakes. I have those same concerns, I understand that history with NAFTA, and I want more than anything for El Paso to succeed and for living conditions and opportunities to improve in this region --  and that is why I will withhold judgement on TPP until it is concluded and presented to Congress and the public.\n \nTo put it as directly as possible: my vote for TPA is not a vote for TPP and does not give the President the authority to commit this country to TPP. In fact, if the President fails to meet the ambitious objectives defined in TPA, I will vote against TPP.\n \nBut I will not let the fear of what the President might not achieve in these negotiations or my deep disappointment in the failings of NAFTA prevent me from at least giving him the chance to try to achieve something better than what we have today. \n \nI don't want to prevent him from having the chance to try to create more export opportunities which could create more jobs in America and El Paso, a community where already one out of every four jobs is dependent on international trade. I don't want to prevent him from trying to use our leverage to exact significantly improved and enforceable working conditions in countries where the right to organize exists in name only. And I don't want to pass up the opportunity to try to get these countries, which represent a huge and growing portion of the globe's population, to follow our environmental standards.\n \nSome might say that we should not pass TPA and instead allow the 535 members of Congress to add amendments and provisions to our trade agreements. Dispensing with the fact that every president since FDR has had this authority and ignoring the probability that this many cooks working on a trade deal with this many countries could successfully conclude negotiations, one would have to believe that the current majority in the House and Senate would improve, and not significantly weaken, environmental and labor standards in an amended bill.\n \nHere's the bottom line: we currently trade with all of the countries with which TPA will give the President the authority to negotiate, and today they have almost unfettered access to our economy (U.S. tariffs with most are near-zero and their tariffs on our goods are as high as 70%). Today's vote on TPA gives us a chance to regulate trade that is already ongoing in a way that provides more opportunities for more of our workers to produce goods that will reach more markets -- and do so in a way that improves the quality of jobs and the environment. It's a chance for El Paso to capitalize on its growing status as a leading trade community and to push us to take the important steps necessary to add greater value to the commerce (over $90 billion a year) that moves through our ports.\n \nIt's not certain that we will achieve these goals, and there is risk in any departure from the status quo. But I'm willing to give the President the chance to succeed with the clear understanding that if he cannot produce a deal that meets these criteria I will vote against it. \n \nIf you are interested in reading the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) bill, click here: https://goo.gl/GS7JMm  \n\nIf you are interested in reading the El Paso Times editorial : “Congress should OK trade fast-track” click here: http://goo.gl/wI7q06	971171992948654

460776160654909	Yesterday the House passed H.R. 2578, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016. This bill sets the government’s annual spending for many economic, science research, and judicial programs. I voted against this bill because it fails to provide adequate funding for many government programs that enhance research, keep Americans safe, and benefit our economy.\n\nFor instance, this bill drastically underfunds the National Science Foundation, which provides research grants around the country, including to UTEP, and are the basis for many scientific breakthroughs. By failing to fund basic research and other programs, we are hindering scientific innovation when it should be a national priority. H.R. 2578 also underfunds the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including ocean and climate research programs. This decrease is unacceptable as we try to understand the effects that we have on the Earth’s climate.\n\nWhile the bill provides an additional $76 million for 55 additional Immigration Judge teams to address current case backlogs, it fails to provide adequate funding for additional legal representation for unaccompanied children and families, the majority of which have fled countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala due to violence and lack of economic and educational opportunities.  Not only will these vulnerable children and families continue to have trouble gaining legal representation in our immigration courts, the entire immigration court process will be less efficient and effective.\n\nIn addition to the underlying legislation, I was able to vote for two important amendments related to drug reform in the United States.  The first one, offered by Representative Rohrabacher from California would prevent the Department of Justice (DoJ) from denying states that have legalized the use of medical marijuana the right to implement their medical marijuana laws.  The amendment passed.\n\nI also supported the amendment offered by Representative McClintock from California that would have stopped the DoJ from preventing states that have legalized the use of marijuana from implementing their marijuana laws.  The amendment failed.\n\nLastly, H.R. 2578 included several amendments that further undermine our country’s  immigration policies, including an amendment offered by Representative Steve King from Iowa.  This amendment would prohibit our court system, specifically the U.S. Court of Appeals, from issuing a final ruling on the legality of the President’s Executive Action on immigration.  If this provision were to become law, it would essentially halt the implementation of the current Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parental Accountability Programs (DAPA), which are programs that provide temporary reprieve to young people and their parents so they may stay in the country.  Unfortunately, this amendment passed.\n\nThese individuals—who go to school and work, serve in the military, and have a clean legal record—are more American than anything else.  Representative King’s amendment put millions of “DREAMers” and their parents at risk of deportation—including the nearly 10,000 “DREAMers” in our community—all the while hampering DHS’s ability to prioritize the use of its limited enforcement resources against legitimate threats along our borders.	965827386816448
460776160654909	Today the House voted on the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act (H.R. 1335), which would reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Conservation and Management Act (MSA). The MSA is the primary law that we use to govern our nation’s coastal fisheries and help prevent overfishing. \n\nI voted against this bill because it will weaken and undermine current MSA regulations.  Specifically, H.R. 1335 would hamper current efforts to restore overfished and depleted fisheries while also undermining important environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act and Antiquities Act.  I believe Congress should support legislation that ensures the ecological health of our country’s waters, while conserving and protecting the environment for future generations.\n\nThis legislation passed the House and is now pending in the Senate.  The President has stated he would veto the bill.	963706480361872

460776160654909	Today, the House considered the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act (H.R. 1806), which authorizes funding for federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) that support research programs throughout our country.\n\nI voted against this bill because it reduces the amount of money available through federal grants to universities and research institutions that conduct important scientific research. These cuts will have a direct impact on universities such as UTEP. For example, H.R. 1806 reduces funding for the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) at NSF by more than $165 million, which works to better understand and predict extreme weather events and disasters. UTEP’s geology doctoral program depends on grants from GEO and these cuts will adversely impact its ability to continue research in this area.\n\nAdditionally, H.R. 1806 reduces funding for the Directorate for Education and Human Resources program at NSF by roughly $100 million, which helps UTEP attract and recruit minority students to its graduate programs in the STEM fields. Without these funds, our community’s ability to attract underrepresented populations to higher education will suffer.\n\nI believe we should support programs that provide an opportunity for our country to produce the scientific advances that will keep us globally competitive.	955878167811370
460776160654909	Today, I voted in support of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (H.R. 2250), which funds the House of Representatives and other legislative branch agencies that support the House such as the Library of Congress, Capitol Police, and Government Accountability Office.\nFor the upcoming fiscal year, the House will not see an increase in its total budget nor will my personal office’s budget – known as an MRA – see an increase either.  H.R. 2250 also includes a provision to prevent a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for Members of Congress, which essentially prohibits my colleagues and me from receiving an increase in our salaries.	955466644519189

460776160654909	Today, the House considered the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36), which would prohibit abortions from being performed after 20 weeks from fertilization while also levying penalties against doctors who perform the procedures.\n\nI voted against H.R. 36 because I believe in a woman’s right to make her own health and reproductive choices.  While I respect the differences in opinions and beliefs regarding women’s health and reproductive issues, I believe Members of Congress should not be making health care decisions for women nor should they be discouraging physicians from providing safe medical care due to fear of legal action.  Women can and should make their own decisions about their bodies.	952348304831023

460776160654909	Today, I voted against H. J. Res 43, which would repeal a law the District of Columbia passed in 2014 to protect DC employees from being fired because of decisions they make surrounding their reproductive rights – including those on abortions or the use of birth control.  \n\nWhile I respect the differences in opinions and beliefs regarding women’s health and reproductive issues, Members of Congress should not be making health care decisions for women. A female employee should not have to fear discriminatory actions by an employer based on private decisions made surrounding her health care. Women can make their own rational and moral judgments when it comes to decisions regarding their bodies.	946203512112169
460776160654909	Today, the House voted on and passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (Milcon-VA) Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 (H.R. 2029).  I voted against this legislation, which provides funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and new construction projects within the Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nIn December, 2013, Congress negotiated a bipartisan budget agreement that provided relief from sequestration and the Budget Control Act for two years.\n\nBeginning in FY 2016, however, budget caps returns and will impose across-the-board spending cuts to all federal programs, including those funded within H.R. 2029.  Under sequestration, H.R. 2029 would impact the VA and DoD’s ability to provide care to our veterans and maintain our military’s footprint within the U.S. and abroad in the coming years.  \n\nSpecifically, H.R. 2029 would:\n\n•  Under-fund the amounts that DoD and VA have indicated they would need to modernize and update their facilities by more than a $1 billion;\n\n• Make cuts to VA’s medical and prosthetic research and other medical support services it provides to our veterans by more than $200 million; and \n\n• Leave out nearly $350 million the Veterans Health Administration will need starting in FY 2016 to manage its VA medical centers, outpatient clinics, and nursing home programs.\n\nIt is my hope that Congress will come to an agreement on an alternative budget deal before the fiscal year ends in September.  I will continue to work toward a bipartisan compromise that rids of the budget caps while also responsibly managing our country’s deficit and debt.\n\nIn addition to the underlying legislation, I was able to vote for two important amendments. The first, offered by Representative Jerry Nadler from New York, would have stripped language from the underlying bill that makes it impossible to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and transfer those prisoners to U.S. soil. This amendment failed. \n\nI also supported a bipartisan amendment offered by Representatives Bluemenauer, Farr and Rohrbacher that would end the current VA policies that prohibits VA doctors from advising their patients on medical marijuana in states where it is legal and if the patient initiates the conversation. Given that medical marijuana has assisted individuals suffering from PTSD and other ailments, I thought it was common sense to allow VA doctors to consult with patients who ask about medical marijuana. Unfortunately, this amendment failed by just a few votes.	946195798779607
146176682102245	Thank you for your comments regarding the president’s amnesty plan.

460776160654909	Earlier this month, the House and Senate passed their respective budget proposals for Fiscal Year 2016 that Congress uses as guidelines to determine the levels at which our federal government and agencies will be funded. Because of differences between the two proposals, the House and Senate were required to iron out any differences and agree on a single compromise. This final product is known as the Budget Conference Report, and it was agreed to yesterday.\n\nI just voted no on that Conference Report. The Conference Report seeks to balance the budget over ten years — a laudable goal — but I believe it goes about doing it in the wrong way. The budget cuts $5.5 trillion from non-defense discretionary spending and entitlements, a large portion of which would come from a complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act resulting in 16 million people losing their health care coverage without providing them an alternative option for coverage; cuts to Medicare benefits; $125 billion in cuts to programs such as SNAP that provide assistance low-income families and children; and the elimination of $85 billion in Pell Grants, making it more difficult for students to pursue higher education. Other federal agencies such as the VA and CBP would be impacted as well thus affecting our community’s ability to care for our veterans and support our CBP Officers and Agents. The resolution also unfairly shields the Department of Defense from many of the same cuts that non-defense agencies are being required to make. This is not a budget deal that is good for El Paso or our nation.	946147742117746

I’m constantly thinking about our national debt, and passing a last-minute deal at the 11th hour doesn’t allow us to give our spending the thorough consideration it deserves. \n\nLike many of you, I oppose the President’s plan for executive amnesty and believe this bill didn’t do enough to hold the President accountable. I hope in the next Congress, we can discuss our budget and each appropriations bill early and with due consideration, so we are not in this position again.	10153510906579988
64137294987	I am disappointed that President Obama has once again decided to ignore the Constitution, our system of checks and balances, and the desires of the American people. Instead of working with a new Congress, the President has decided to go it alone and use another executive power grab. The American people are tired of it. The President’s failure to enforce our immigration laws is an affront to the millions of people and families who have played by the rules, saved long and hard to become American citizens, and spent years in line in the hope of someday having the opportunity to live the American Dream. I have had the honor of working with and assisting so many individuals and families in the 19th District of Texas through the legal immigration process. They deserve better from this Administration.\n\nWhile the President doubles down on his legacy of lawlessness, tonight Congress must double down on our efforts to hold the President accountable to the American people and stand up to defend the Constitution. We must use all available tools to stop this power grab.	10153447600274988

326420614138023	Today was supposed to be the first day folks could apply for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), but the measure is held up in the courts.

326420614138023	It’s hard to believe that in 2015, on average, women still earn 78 cents for every dollar made by a man. This discrepancy is unacceptable – women deserve equal pay for equal work.

107736785195	ICYMI: House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith hosted Apollo astronaut and Kerrville resident Gene Cernan last week for a screening of The Last Man on the Moon, a documentary on Cernan’s life.\n\nChairman Lamar Smith: “Gene traveled from Texas to be with us this evening.  He is a genuine American hero, not just for coming from Texas, but for what he’s done as an astronaut. Gene owns a ranch in Kerrville, Texas, and you’ll see some of the beauty of the Texas Hill Country in this movie.\n\n“I first met Gene Cernan when he and Neil Armstrong testified before the Science Committee in September 2011. At that hearing, Gene’s advice to young people was to ‘never stop shooting for the Moon.’\n\n“In his autobiography, he observed: ‘Too many years have passed for me to still be the last man to have left his footprints on the Moon. I believe with all my heart that somewhere out there is a young boy or girl with indomitable will and courage who will lift that dubious distinction from my shoulders and take us back where we belong. Let us give that dream a chance.’         \n\n“Sage advice to those of us in Congress, by someone who understands the value of inspiration and his role in turning dreams into reality.”\n\nPrior to the event, Cernan also addressed lawmakers about the importance of leadership in space exploration. \n\nhttp://ow.ly/MC9gw	10153250552330196

These proposals will have far-reaching impacts that will be felt in communities all across Texas and the nation. We must ensure that our nation’s policies serve the interest of the American people – not an extreme political agenda. As chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure that agencies like the EPA are operating in the most efficient, effective, and accountable manner possible.”	10153180817345196

123858487781636	I rarely post things about religion. Religion is an intensely personal thing. Everyone has their own personal relationship with God - whatever they perceive God to be.\n\nA friend of mine who is a graduate of Notre Dame sent me the following things to meditate on this morning. I thought I would share.\n\nWith all that's going on in the world - innocent people shot down from the sky by a missile over the Ukraine; children showing up in record numbers along the US/Mexico border;  trouble spots around the globe - these reflections seemed particularly appropriate today.\n\nMany of us in the US complain regularly. We're always mad about something. We think we have it bad. We believe that our country is somehow failing. Those feelings are a consequence of our freedom and our success as a nation. Being unhappy is both our privilege and our prerogative.\n\nYet, oftentimes we lose sight of the fact that our country - more than any other in the history of man - has been blessed by God. We Americans - all of us - are the fortunate ones. When we think our situation is bad, we have but to look around. Others have it so much worse.\n\nAmerica is strong - and we must all work together to keep it that way. GOD BLESS AMERICA.	315137795320370

123858487781636	As my 52nd birthday comes to a close, I want to take a moment to say thank you to the many folks who sent me greetings on twitter, FB, by email, by text or even w/ those wonderful "old-fashioned" greeting cards.  All the well wishes brightened my day and meant a lot.  They touched my heart.\n\nBirthdays are a little bittersweet for me now.  Nowadays, I always dedicate them to my dad.  He would always be the very first person to call me on my birthday - bright and early at 6am.  I really miss those calls.\n\nThough I started my day in a rather somber and pensive way, so many friends wished me a happy birthday that it was impossible to be sad.  Thanks for that.\n\nThanks, too, for the huge privilege and honor of letting me serve you, my friends and neighbors in West Texas & all across CD23, in the US Congress.  It is a dream come true.\n\n-ppg	235551059945711

123858487781636	Congress finally reopened the government. Today, Congress finally learned an age old lesson: when you're in a hole, stop digging.  Congress must learn to put country and patriotism ahead of party, politics, personality or pride. It should be in the business of finding solutions, not causing problems.  \n\nIt is irresponsible to hurt the nation's economy and deliberately cause anxiety to middle class families and the market.  Last minute deals are an irresponsible way to govern.	221898787977605
123858487781636	Shots were fire outside the US Capitol. We're on temporary lock-down. Our staff is safe.	217574171743400
123858487781636	My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Those working at the Navy Yard – and military installations across the country and throughout the world – are patriots. They are also spouses, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and brothers and sisters.\n\nI pray that God will bless and keep the victims and their families, for whom life will never again be the same. May our system of law hold the individual or individuals every inch accountable for their cowardly, heinous and despicable act. \n\nI’ll continue to monitor the situation through the House Armed Services Committee, on which I serve, along with the Office of Secretary of Defense.\n\nWe will bring those responsible for this cowardly act to justice.	212091098958374
123858487781636	I take a decision on the use of military force very seriously. We must always understand the impact of our decisions on our Armed Forces and the family members who support them. \n\nOver the coming days, I’m going to continue to receive briefings and take in information on the types of military action being considered. Ultimately, I’ll make a decision based on the final language of any authorization to use military force and its relationship to any threat to American security or the security of America's interests. \n\nI know how critical it is to get this right and want to hear from everyone about their opinions on Syria.	207267339440750

Estoy orgulloso de que haya sido aprobada la enmienda que propuse, para dar más flexibilidad al Departamento de Transporte para movilizar fondos hacia la Oficina de Inteligencia, Seguridad y Respuesta de emergencia en caso de una emergencia.

123858487781636	Durante el debate sobre inmigración, los mitos acerca de nuestra región fronteriza han sido difundidos por aquellos que no tienen ni conexión ni conocimiento de nuestra región. La gente necesita repensar la frontera. Como representante del distrito con la mayor parte de la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México, sé que la región fronteriza significa empleos para el resto del país. Más de 400.000 empleos en Texas se basan en nuestro comercio con México. Las exportaciones  de los Estados Unidos a México exceden nuestras exportaciones a Brasil, Rusia, India y China juntas. #RethinktheBorder #TX23	192135010953983
123858487781636	Today I voted to protect students & maintain accountability. I voted NO on HR5. The bill guts the core goal that all students should receive a quality education. It leaves children behind by taking resources from kids who need it most. In a vast district like the 23rd, this legislation accomplishes the difficult feat of impacting everyone the same way:  it is bad for everybody. It harms students in both rural and urban areas and everywhere in between. #TX23	189714614529356

123858487781636	Congratulations to the City of El Paso for ranking the safest large city in the country for the third straight year. All El Pasoans should be proud. It’s indicative of the values of the residents, and the hard working men and women in law enforcement. \n\nIn my many years in public office, I've always wanted the opportunity to represent a portion of El Paso. I’m proud I finally have that chance.	133918716775613
6349487899	It was on this evening 71 years ago when General Dwight Eisenhower informed American troops that the following morning - June 6, 1944 - they would storm the beaches of Normandy to liberate Europe from Nazi oppression.\n\nThis week, in advance of the 71st Anniversary of D-Day, I visited the WWII Memorial to honor all those who served and pay my personal respects to the many Texans who put their lives on the line to ensure that freedom prevailed over tyranny.\n\nThe D-Day operation still stands as the largest seaborne invasion in history. Over 9,000 Allied soldiers were killed or wounded but their sacrifice would allow more than 100,000 troops to push forward, gain a foothold in Europe and secure victory in the Atlantic.\n\nAmerica will forever remember these heroes of the Greatest Generation.	10153263033987900
6349487899	After two days of debate and consideration of more than 40 amendments, the vote on the Student Success Act (H.R. 5) has been pushed to a later date. With consideration ongoing, the legislation that was in front of us today could end up looking very different – for better or worse – when it comes time to vote. That’s why I wait to make a final decision until all the amendments are on the table and I can examine the final bill myself. Thank you to everyone who has called or emailed to provide input thus far. Please keep the feedback coming.	10153019085007900

6349487899	The September 11, 2001 attacks left deep wounds that will never fully heal for all those who lost loved ones and for our nation as a whole. Today we mourn every man, woman, and child that was taken from us and honor their legacies.\n\nWhile 9/11 will forever symbolize America’s darkest hour, it will also shine as a brilliant illustration of the unwavering bond that holds our nation together. A clear message was sent to all who wish to do us harm that the American spirit will never be broken. This is the message we send to those who threaten us today. We will never forget all the loved ones lost to acts of terror and will forever remain united by the sacrifices made to secure and preserve the freedom of this great nation.	10152620896507900

6349487899	The president’s speech tonight leaves me unconvinced that he fully comprehends the threat posed by ISIS or that he has a serious plan to destroy them. If the president wants additional authority and funding, he must present Congress and the American people with a concrete military objective and comprehensive strategy. Not outline a four point plan on television and then pressure us to get on board.	10152619715212900
6349487899	Conservatives have fought hard today to ensure that the Blackburn/Cruz DACA bill completely defunds DACA and any similar amnesty program the president might try to create in the future. We have been successful. A vote on the bill is scheduled for later this evening and I will be voting YES.	10152524344767900
6349487899	Conservatives have fought hard today to ensure that the Blackburn/Cruz bill completely defunds DACA and any similar amnesty program the president might try to create in the future.

6349487899	I just voted to pass the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, a bill I cosponsored which would guard against overreaching regulations that limit access to hunting and fishing. For many Texans, myself included, these are not just recreational activities – they are long-standing family traditions.	10152126284877900
6349487899	President Obama delivers the State of the Union address tonight at 8 PM Central, and will be followed by the Republican address. What type of agenda do you think the President will outline for our nation this coming year? What would you like the President to focus on?	10152109232697900
6349487899	I voted today to pass the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, which would clearly prohibit the use of any federal funds from being used to subsidize elective abortions or health plans covering abortions.	10152108957167900
6349487899	I voted against the omnibus spending bill because it authorizes over $1 trillion in new spending while doing little to reform wasteful federal programs. With a national debt of more than $17 trillion, we can’t afford to further the status-quo by spending more money we don’t have. You deserve to have your hard-earned tax dollars treated more responsibly.	10152084799487900
6349487899	I opposed the Ryan-Murray budget deal. Despite its good intentions, I could not vote for a plan that relies on the promise of future spending constraints in order to achieve savings. These are the types of promises that have gotten our country into this fiscal situation and they will not help get us out of it. Washington does not have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem, and this bill authorizes even more short-term spending.	10152008815307900
6349487899	ANNOUNCEMENT: The Ways & Means Committee will hold a hearing tomorrow at 9 a.m. (CST)/10 a.m. (EST) to investigate the problems with the implementation of Obamacare.

6349487899	I voted tonight against increasing America’s debt limit and a short-term continuing resolution. The public debt, already near $17 trillion, should only be raised with responsible spending cuts and a long-term plan to reduce the deficit. Unfortunately, the bill that came before the House only gave the President a blank check to continue reckless spending.   \n\nThe President and Democrat-controlled Senate failed to offer common sense reforms to tackle the tax code, address long-term costs of entitlement programs, or stop Obamacare. The president granted one-year delays from the healthcare law to big businesses; it’s only fair that families and individuals receive the same treatment. \n\nI am disappointed the opportunity was not seized to solve these structural problems today. I will continue to work to bring fairness for all Americans, balance the budget, reduce the debt, and restore accountability to our nation’s finances.	10151860236627900

6349487899	I voted today to ensure U.S. border security and enforcement agencies have the funding needed to keep our nation safe and secure. This is one of many bipartisan measures passed by the House that would fund critical parts of our government. The Senate should build on this momentum and work with us to end the shutdown fairly.	10151847320622900
6349487899	Members of Congress should NOT be paid if the government shuts down. Members of military service should ALWAYS be paid during any period. I co-sponsored two bills that express those measures.	10151824382107900
6349487899	Last night, I voted to delay Obamacare and keep the government open. The president already granted exemptions with the healthcare law to big businesses and insurance companies. It's only fair that families and individuals receive the same treatment.	10151822057452900
6349487899	I thank Senator Ted Cruz for taking the fight against Obamacare to the Senate floor. I recently voted with my House colleagues to keep the government open and defund Obamacare. Now it’s time for the Senate to listen to the American people.	10151813630347900
6349487899	The House passed a continuing resolution to defund Obamacare and keep the government open. Now it’s time for the Senate to act.

322383274535068	This week I visited Lelands in Grandview. Small businesses are still the backbone of our nation, and as a small business owner myself, I understand the harmful effects President Obama’s policies are having on job creators in Texas.

322383274535068	Today marks the one-year anniversary of a senseless act of violence at Fort Hood, the Great Place. I join those across the country and worldwide in pausing to remember the victims of this tragedy. My thoughts and prayers are with those who are still grieving, including the residents of Killeen. While the scars of the 2009 attack were continuing to heal, last year we were once again dealt an unspeakable loss, but I truly believe that time heals all. I frequently cite the Texas spirit of resolve, and I believe it is most apparent at Fort Hood. Together, we must push forward. We must remember the victims, and we must continue their memories by carrying on Fort Hood’s mission into the future.	677951122311613
322383274535068	Yesterday the House Committee on Financial Services heard from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on the state of our nation's monetary system. While Yellen referenced low unemployment and an improvement in overall job creation, the truth is that many Texans continue to feel the effects of regulatory burdens brought on by the Fed.  \n\nAlthough Texas is one of the healthiest economies in the country, it has 115 fewer banks today than four years ago. Community banks account for a great deal of small business lending, but it is difficult for these banks to remain afloat when regulatory compliance rates have increased between 50 and 200 percent.	659504477489611
322383274535068	The Keystone XL pipeline would have created jobs and ensured energy security from a trusted friend and neighbor. I am frustrated that this president only listens to the advice of his close circle of political insiders and government bureaucrats.\n\nMultiple U.S. State Department reports reaffirmed that the Keystone pipeline would not harm the environment and Canada would likely develop its energy resources with or without U.S. support. \n\nRather than doing what is best for our country President Obama is more concerned with appeasing the baseless claims of his wealthy environmentalist supporters than governing by the wishes of the majority of Americans and their representatives in Congress. While President Obama has no problem reminding us he was reelected, he forgets he said that the midterm elections would be a referendum on his administration’s policies.	658925770880815
322383274535068	President Obama signed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act into law six months ago, but he has already proposed cuts to a provision that expands network coverage for veterans living in rural areas, like much of the Texas 25th congressional district. The program, known as Veterans Choice, was meant to reduce veterans’ wait times that were the result of a claims backlog brought to light in a scandal last year. My hope was that Veterans Choice would restore the VA’s culture of trust. For that reason, I am leading an inquiry with my colleagues to determine why these cuts are being proposed and what Congress can do to best serve those who honorably served their country, whether it is through the Veterans Choice program or another method. You can read our letter to VA Secretary Robert McDonald by clicking on the link below:\n\nhttp://williams.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/roger-williams-leads-inquiry-into-veterans-choice-cuts	656382091135183
6916472567	It seems fitting that on National Doctors' Day I would have the privilege of speaking at the new Parkland Hospital's dedication ceremony. From back when I completed my residency at Parkland to today, the medical professionals there have always put service to patients and community first. I have no doubt that this new state-of-the-art facility will continue that legacy with distinction.	10152821170762568
322383274535068	In Monday’s budget release, President Obama talks about “middle class economics.”  However, the President has once again shown he chooses to put an unnecessary burden on the backs of soldiers and their families.  In his 2016 budget, the President proposes funding cuts for the Federal Impact Aid Program by $67 billion.  Since 1950, Congress has provided important financial assistance to school districts that have lost a portion of their local tax base because of Federal ownership of property - whether that be a National Park or Military installation.  In Congress, I am proud to represent several of these school districts, including ones in Killeen, Copperas Cove, and Gatesville, who service the men and women of Ft. Hood.  My colleagues in the House should reject these cuts and restore funding to its fullest.	649880421785350
322383274535068	As a strong supporter of life, I was proud to vote for H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act.  The bill passed the House overwhelmingly by a vote of 242-179.  Yesterday’s March for Life marked the 42nd time Pro-Life supporters gathered in Washington, DC on the anniversary of  Roe v. Wade.  The anniversary reminds us how sacred human life is and the millions of lives tragically lost due to abortion in America.	644744842298908
322383274535068	Today, the House acted once again with broad bipartisan support to pass the Keystone XL Pipeline - a bill that will create thousands of good-paying jobs and strengthen America's energy security. President Obama ought to listen to the majority of the American public and sign this into law rather than cater to a small group of liberal activists.	638848499555209

322383274535068	President Obama’s negotiations with the communist regime in Cuba are inexcusable and unfathomable.  I remember the Cuban Missile crisis, the decades of human rights abuses, the withholding and covering up of information.  These atrocities directly threaten our national security, and Cuba’s leaders should continue to suffer consequences for their brutal actions.  President Obama continues to weaken our nation’s standing among our adversaries, and I’m afraid that this policy shift regarding Cuba signals an acceptance of one of the most oppressive and violent regimes in the world.	625795574193835
322383274535068	I want to thank these 2 excellent interns from my office in Washington, D.C. for all their hard work on behalf of Texas' 25th Congressional District the last 4 months. Dakota Foster (left) is a junior at TCU. Robert Spigler (right) is a sophomore at Tulane. They have answered thousands of phone calls, attended hearings and briefings, and assisted me and my staff in more ways than I can count. I appreciate their hard work and wish them the best of luck as they return to school next semester!	623416807765045
322383274535068	Two weeks ago, when the President unveiled his plans to act alone on immigration orders, I pledged to do everything in my power to prevent President Obama’s unlawful actions that would grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants in the United States.  Today’s spending bill not only does nothing to thwart the President’s unilateral actions, it provides full funding for them. My constituents are outraged by the Administration’s neglect of our border and disregard for enforcing our current laws. While there are good provisions in this bill, I cannot allow President Obama to receive funding to usurp Congress and implement his amnesty-driven agenda.  Fully securing our border needs to be a top priority for our leaders, and we can’t afford to take this huge step backwards.	623121421127917
322383274535068	Today I was honored to present Sgt. Micah Phillips with his Purple Heart medal he earned while injured in Iraq in 2008. Even after his convoy was struck by a heavy IED attack, Sgt.

He is a hero, and I am honored to know him. God bless our troops!	619690991470960
322383274535068	The House just passed the bipartisan, bicameral NDAA to authorize the funding our military. This bill is crucial to our national defense and in providing for each man and woman who wears the uniform.

322383274535068	I am deeply disappointed by the Obama Administration’s failure to reach an agreement that would prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.  It is obvious to me that Iran is not serious about abandoning its nuclear program and only cares about gaining more time and resources to continue its dangerous activities.  Offering the Iranian regime a seven-month extension in exchange for the status quo and a promise to continue with negotiations is absurd.  Strong economic sanctions are what brought Iran to the table and should continue until we have substantial evidence that they have abandoned their efforts to obtain nuclear weapons capability. It is my hope that the 114th Congress, with Republicans in control of the House and Senate, will take up this debate and work on passing tougher new sanctions on the Iranian regime.	615371861902873

6916472567	Today I introduced the "Equal Protection for American Workers Act," H.R. 205, which would prevent the Secretary of Homeland Security from granting work authorizations to people who have been determined -- in a valid immigration proceeding -- to be illegally present in the United States. \n\nPresident Obama is using his pen to take executive action to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. We must do all we can to ensure law abiding American citizens are able to get the work they need. \n\nWith the labor participation rate being the lowest it has been in more than 30 years under the policies of this president, it is crucial to ensure American citizens who want a job can get a job, and are not having to compete for jobs with those who have entered our country illegally. #NoAmnesty #EqualProtectionforAmericanWorkers	10152660939967568

6916472567	Here is my statement in reaction to news that talks to dismantle large parts of Iran's nuclear program were extended by another seven months:\n\n"The world looks to the United States in moments of global uncertainty, and this most recent action -- or inaction -- by the Obama administration appears not only weak, but dangerous. Instead of making a strong statement against a country that is a threat to global peace and has a deplorable human rights record, this administration has showed weakness and fragility by offering a seven-month extension. Stability in this region is in the best interest of the United States and its allies. It is time we see strong leadership from the Obama administration, who should hold Iran accountable for its actions."	10152545452142568
6916472567	My statement in response to the president's announcement that he will take executive action to unilaterally grant amnesty to the millions of illegal immigrants currently living in the United States:\n\n“The president’s announcement comes at a curious time. I personally have a different perception of the urgency of this situation. Frankly, there is no evidence that the 11 million people currently living in the United States illegally are at immediate risk for deportation. In fact, the president’s comments earlier this year encouraged even more illegal and unsafe immigration that has put a terrible strain on our system in the state of Texas in particular and for the nation as a whole.\n\n“But the timing is also peculiar considering that just weeks ago, the American people made clear that they are unhappy with the president’s policies, power grabs and disregard for the rule of law when they overwhelmingly elected Republicans to public office.\n\n“And finally, the president has had six years to work with Congress – including two years in which his party held the majority in both chambers of Congress – to introduce immigration reform in a constitutional and legal way. The simple truth is that he could not get this done then, so he is resorting to using executive power – which is by definition temporary – to shove this measure through. Not only is it bad policy, but it is unfair to the millions of people who are waiting in line to come to the Unites States legally. It is a further erosion of the Constitution and American legal system that the Obama administration has perpetuated time and time again.”	10152537484302568

186894244673001	Just in case y’all were wondering, I was a No vote on TPA. Here’s why, I am a strong proponent of free trade, but after six years of broken promises and false assurances from President Obama I could not support this legislation. Our border remains unsecured, our healthcare system is broken, and the President won’t even enforce our laws. My constituents and I are not convinced that the President can be trusted with more power.	1065691056793311
186894244673001	I will continue to stand for your right to privacy from the government as I did yesterday. Agencies have been using license plate readers not just for altruistic purposes, but also to store your data for years at a time. Where you drive, park, and go to church was all being stored in bulk collection and, in some cases, it was proven to be used for mass surveillance not tied to an open criminal investigation. That is why yesterday I voted for an amendment that prohibits the use of funds to buy a camera for the purpose of collecting or storing vehicle license plate numbers.	1063072000388550

169479190984	Yesterday, nine people were shot and killed in Charleston, South Carolina when a deranged young male entered a church gathering at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Pastor Clementa Pinckney was among those who were killed. This church and the families involved are living their worst nightmare. My thoughts go out to the family and friends of all of those affected by this senseless killing.\n\nEmanuel AME church is a historic pillar in the community of Charleston. It is the oldest church in the southern region of the United States. It is nearly as old as the country itself, dating back to the late 1700s. It has many ties to slavery and the civil rights movement. The church hosted Dr. Martin King Jr. when he visited the state in the 60’s.\n\nCharleston’s Police Chief, Greg Mullen has said that this incident is being investigated and treated by the FBI and local law enforcement as a Hate Crime. There is no other explanation for someone to walk into a place of worship and commit murder. However, though this senseless act was committed in a sanctuary for prayer let us never neglect our responsibility to pray for the families and for one another.\n\nWe pause all across the country to remember the members and Pastor Clementa Pinckney who served as a state senator in the southern region of South Carolina, and community activist. Pastor Pinckney died serving the people. There is no better way to live and no better way to leave. \n\nThe community has many questions, questions that I share. The untimely death of 9 congregants of the Emanuel AME has caused a variety of emotions including outrage, fear and sadness. We must do what we can to apprehend the killer and support the families involved in this tragedy. Let us be sure to direct our anger, emotions and desire for justice, towards the apprehension of the perpetrator and the healing from this horrid hatred for the nation. This was a hate crime. The words of Dr. Martin King Jr. should guide us in this time of frustration.  "Hate cannot drive out hate." If we are to retaliate against those who perpetrated hate, we must do it only in love.”	10153333230115985

I look forward to working with the President to get Trade Adjustment Assistance legislation and trade authority that clearly invest in the American people, keeps our manufactures working and promotes the income of working American’s; and also lifts the quality of life of the most vulnerable in those new trade markets that we desire to be a part of.  I applaud the President for his commitment for helping poor and working people and I look forward to working with him to get the results we both desire.\n\n“There are also, however, serious national issues to be addressed. We must start that now – rebuilding Americas infrastructure, expanding educational opportunities and raising wages to close the gap of income inequality. Finally, my legislative agenda has always been to support our small business and they too must be empowered by any trade agreement.”\n\n###	10153318135100985

Ever since, May 5th has served as an opportunity to honor the proud history of our Mexican neighbors, and to celebrate the generations of contributions that Mexican Americans and all Hispanic Americans have made to the United States. \n \n“Today, we are reminded of the rich and diverse immigrant heritage that is the heart of our country.  Immigration is the constant reinvigoration of America, and each generation of immigrants makes America more American.  Yet Republicans continue their assault on hard-working immigrant families and continue to stand against the comprehensive immigration reform our nation so urgently needs.  \n \n“Democrats will continue to push for bold action to restore accountability, compassion and common sense to our broken immigration system.  Let us draw fresh inspiration from the Battle of Puebla, and let us renew our determination to achieve comprehensive immigration reform that honors the heritage, the history, and the values of our nation.”	10153215937525985

WARREN WEINSTEIN AND GIOVANNI LO PORTO\n\nWASHINGTON, DC – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a Senior Member of the House Homeland Security Committee, released the following statement today on the deaths of Dr. Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, who were being held as hostages by al Qaeda:\n\n“I was saddened to learn of the tragic deaths of Dr. Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto while they were being held as hostages by al Qaeda.  My thoughts are with their families during this difficult time. Dr. Weinstein was from the state of Maryland, and my colleagues and I had been hoping to see him returned safely to his wife Elaine and their two daughters and the community that had rallied together to support them through the ordeal of his captivity.  \n\n“The uniquely tragic nature of the operation that resulted in the deaths of two innocent hostages is something we will do our utmost to ensure is not repeated.  To this end, although the operation was lawful and conducted consistent with our counterterrorism policies, I would hope we would conduct a thorough independent review to understand fully what happened and how we can prevent this type of tragic incident in the future. \n\n“Many within our government spent years attempting to locate and free Dr. Weinstein and Mr. Lo Porto.  The pain of their deaths will remain with us as we rededicate ourselves to adhering to the most exacting standards in doing all we can to protect the American people.   This incident reminds us of the extraordinary contributions and sacrifices of diplomats and aid workers from our country and our allies who serve on the front lines every day, often at great personal risk.  They continue to deserve our respect and admiration as they carry out their important work.”	10153189647480985

As America continues its struggles to protect and expand civil rights for all, I am confident Ms. Lynch will bring a fresh perspective in securing voting rights, addressing over-criminalization and improving the criminal justice system as a whole. \n\n“President Obama’s nomination of Ms. Lynch to be our 83rd Attorney General makes her a dynamic addition to his diverse and distinguished cabinet.  Now that she is confirmed Ms. Lynch will continue the legacy left behind by our current Attorney General Holder, as the first African-American woman to hold the position.  It was unfortunate that we did not have a speedy Senate confirmation of this daughter of the South and of a North Carolina preacher. I look forward to working with her on important matters coming before both the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees in the coming months.\n\n“I want to thank Attorney General Eric Holder for his service to this country. There are few more important jobs in our nation's government than that of Attorney General. The Attorney General serves as ‘the guardian of that revered document’ that is the basis of our laws and the driving force of our democracy. To this date, Attorney General Holder has done that with the utmost diligence and respect.”	10153189543805985
169479190984	CONGRESSWOMAN SHEILA JACKSON LEE STATEMENT ON States Asking To Be Released from Texas Judge's Immigration Injunction:\n\nI applaud this sensible and pragmatic step taken by this group of 14 states as they seek to remove the backwards, harmful, and debilitating injunction issued by Judge Hanen.  It should come as no surprise that they sought this action because logic would dictate that states should follow federal law which is superior to state law—though certain Texas officials are would rather break up families than simply respect President Obama’s lawful Executive Order.\n\nAmerica is a humane, welcoming, and merciful country and that is why I support the 14 states’ effort and look forward to a favorable ruling on their behalf.\n\nThe American people deserve better.	10153100403040985

128735131872	Yesterday, I was invited to speak at the Houston Food Bank (Official Page) to celebrate the great work they’re doing for Houstonians and to congratulate them on receiving the Food Bank of the Year Award. \n\nIn many ways, America is the land of prosperity. But for 1 in 6 people in the United States, 1 in 5 in Harris County, hunger is a harsh reality. These are often hard-working adults, children and seniors who simply cannot make ends meet and are forced to go without food for several meals, or even days. In our District, almost 121,000 individuals are food insecure, that’s 17 % of the population I serve. \n\nWonderful organizations like the Houston Food Bank work tirelessly to meet the needs of our neighbors who have fallen on hard times. Last year alone, HFB and partner organizations   distributed more than 10 million pounds of food. Thirty-five percent of that food was the fresh fruits and vegetables we know are key in supporting a healthy lifestyle and avoiding obesity and the many serious health illnesses and chronic diseases that result from it.  \n\nI could not be more proud to represent people who actively volunteer and support the Houston Food Bank as a regional resource and whose engagement has resulted in it being named Food Bank of the Year!	10153382443266873

128735131872	Last night, the Senate passed our House bill, H.R. 2, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act. This bill finally replaces the broken SGR formula, and extends funding for two years for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Community Health Centers Program. These critical programs provide care for children, and local communities with low access to healthcare. It passed with overwhelmingly bipartisan support in the House. Americans will now have more security and access to the care they need.	10153238948616873

128735131872	Today, House Republicans voted for the 56th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act, yet they have no contingency plan for the millions of Americans that are now covered under the ACA. Last year, 12 million uninsured Americans gained health coverage through the #ACA, 3 million young adults gained health coverage because they can now stay on their parents’ health plan up to age 26, and seniors have saved and average of $1,407 each on prescription drugs. The numbers speak for themselves. It’s time to put the politics to rest, and get back to working on unresolved issues.	10153066376081873
128735131872	Today marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp – a day we now set aside as Holocaust Remembrance Day.

128735131872	Today, the House is considering a legislative package to keep the government funded before the deadline at midnight. Unfortunately, the House Majority has used the must-pass omnibus bill to undo important rules that protect working Americans from risky wall street trading, and disregards the previous limit on campaign contributions from big donors. Congress must do its job and pass a spending measure, or risk another government shutdown, which would harm working families. The best path forward is for House leadership to bring up a clean omnibus bill that would pass with bipartisan support. #CRomnibus	10152914352361873
128735131872	Monday, December 15, is the last to #getcovered if you want your new coverage to start on January 1. Don’t wait, visit healthcare.gov to shop for a plan that fits your health care needs and budget. This year, the number of insurance companies offering plans in Marketplace has increased by 25 percent, which means there are more options and competitive prices for Americans.	10152914264936873
128735131872	Don’t forget, now is the time to #getcovered. From now until February 15, you can sign up for an affordable plan that fits your budget and health needs at HealthCare.gov or CuidadodeSalud.gov. To receive coverage that starts on January 1, 2015 you must enroll before December 15, 2014. \n\nIf you selected a plan in the Market Place last year, you will be automatically reenrolled in your current plan unless you select a new plan before the deadline. Visit www.healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 for questions or assistance. #ACA #Openenrollment	10152908973571873
128735131872	Today, the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health is holding a hearing to discuss the future of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. CHIP provides insurance coverage for over 8 million children around the country. While the program itself is authorized through September of 2019, funding must be renewed before October 2015. This program is important to well being of so many children, we’re glad this hearing is well in advance of funding expiration. #FundCHIP	10152894827151873

367963843082	Earlier this week I spoke on the House Floor about the disastrous effects of ObamaCare, and although my math was admittedly off, the impact of ObamaCare remains the same. \n\nSince 2010, ObamaCare has imposed more than $27.2 billion in regulatory burdens on the private sector, and the government will have spent more than $6 billion implementing a failed website and failed exchanges by the end of this year. According to the Congressional Budget Office, ObamaCare will cost a whopping $1.2 trillion over the next ten years. In addition to this staggering cost, millions of Americans have been forced off of their preferred health plans or are stuck paying drastically higher premiums. The National Bureau of Economic Research found that in 2014 premiums in the non-group health insurance market grew by 24.4 percent on average compared to what they would have been without ObamaCare. \n\nThese numbers reveal the true impact of ObamaCare. This disastrous law has cost billions of dollars, increased costs on American families and broken promise after promise.	10153296082273083

510462622331477	Vela Statement on Blackhawk Helicopters Sent to South Texas\n\nOut of deference to Mexico's sovereignty, we have largely deferred to their government to effectively control violence in Matamoros and Tamaulipas. Those efforts have largely failed. When Mexican bullets are aimed across the river at United States law enforcement, that changes the game. We cannot stand for such activity, and I fully support Customs and Border Protection's decision to send Blackhawk helicopters to protect our men and women in the field. I hope it is enough.	985999814777753

More importantly, this letter sends the message that we will not stand idly by and let criminals destabilize the U.S.-Mexico border region. \n\nI will continue to bring attention to this issues so that we may achieve our joint-desire to bring stability back to the Mexican side of the border and move our region forward. \n \nThe full text of the letter may be found here: http://goo.gl/l7Lte2	981883141856087
510462622331477	PSA:\n \nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), grid operator for most of Texas, is asking electric consumers in the Lower Rio Grande Valley region to limit or reduce electric use where possible, especially during the 3-7 p.m. peak demand hours, today through Friday, June 5, 2015.\n \n"Due to some unplanned generating unit outages, together with early summer high demand for electricity, we expect to need help from consumers to help maintain system reliability in the Valley area for the remainder of this week," said Dan Woodfin, ERCOT director of System Operations. "Until current efforts to increase transmission and generation capabilities to serve the growing Valley region are complete, even minimal unplanned outages during high electricity demand periods can create challenges."\n \nThese power conservation efforts are part of a precautionary measure to ensure overall reliability of the #RGV power grid. I will continue to monitor the situation closely, and my office will continue to offer assistance to the ERCOT when needed.	981794691864932

Judge Silva’s life has been one of integrity and dedication.

510462622331477	Today, the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel had its first meeting. The work that we’ll do will have a direct impact on the battlefield and the safety of Americans, both at home and abroad.\n \nWe will be working to prevent groups like ISIS from receiving reinforcements in Iraq and Syria from foreign fighters, and to blunt their efforts to destabilize regions through violence and extremism.  \n \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to create American policy that will degrade ISIS’ ability to fight, lessen the ability of foreign fighters to move freely, and most importantly, make our country much safer.	937000826344319
510462622331477	Today, I hosted a bipartisan Congressional Delegation in South Texas focusing on transportation and infrastructure development, which included the Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. Rep. Bill Shuster.\n\nThe Port of Brownsville Director, Eddie Campirano, and Commissioner, John Wood, were also on site to discuss the importance of the Port of Brownsville for our area and plans for future expansion and growth of the port.\n\n“The Port of Brownsville is an economic engine for the entire region, and we must work closely with the Army Corp of Engineers to ensure we make needed improvements including deepening the port to accommodate future growth,” Shuster said.  “I will continue to work with Filemon Vela to ensure that this project moves forward.”\n\nI thank Congressman Shuster for his leadership and commitment to helping grow the Port of Brownsville, and I am happy that we’re able to come together to support the growth of South Texas. I’ll continue to work with him and other members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to ensure we prioritize this important project, and keep the #TX34 economy moving forward.	933449500032785

154050553704	After his initial proclamation for state involvement, Governor Abbott late Friday requested federal assistance.  President Obama immediately granted the request, issuing a Major Disaster Declaration for parts of Texas which includes Hays and other impacted counties. Hays County has been granted both Public and Individual Assistance. Soon, FEMA will have teams on the ground to measure the amount and type of damage that occurred to public and private property and ways to mitigate reoccurrence of such damage. I will continue to post federal updates as I receive them. Given the damage in Spring River Estates and River Bend Subdivision in Martindale, Caldwell County is also expected to make a request for assistance.\n\nIndividuals and business owners in Harris, Hays and Van Zandt Counties who sustained losses due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding can begin applying for assistance by registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov.  If you do not have access to the internet you may register by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or 1-800-462-7585(TTY).  If you use 711 relay or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 800-621-3362 directly.  The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (local time) seven days a week until further notice.	10153100771863705

242042855928904	I appreciate your concern with my vote for Speaker of the House. At the end of the day, only one candidate proved he was capable to unite the Republican House. Not only was John Boehner the best choice, he was the only one who actually campaigned for the position. Louie Gohmert is a good friend and I respect his passion but let’s be clear: he was not a credible candidate. That was proven by the fact that he only received 3 votes, despite being pushed by Freedom Works and others.\n\nIt is truly unfortunate that we in the House were not able to follow the examples of wise conservative leaders like Senators Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul. These statesmen, when faced with the difficult choice of selecting their leader, chose to put aside their various differences and unanimously elect Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader of the Senate.\n \nConservative stalwarts like myself and Trey Gowdy chose to unite, not further divide our party. The Republican Party ideals reflect something better—American ideals. Where we can disagree without being disagreeable, realize that we have opposition—not enemies. And as the great Republican leader Abraham Lincoln stated, “A house divided against itself cannot stand.”\n\nA united conservative movement is stronger than a divided one. I am asking you to join with me. Let’s get to work, and save this great nation for our children and grandchildren.	605259959607190

242042855928904	For the past several months, both in Utah and Washington, D.C., I've been fighting for action to be taken towards the IRS. \n\nI am proud to have voted in favor of the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014, which passed the House today. The first amendment of the Constitution gives us the right of free speech, a right which our nation was founded upon. All Americans — Republican, Democratic or Independent — should have the peace of mind that the IRS will remain non-partisan and not motivated by politics. This week, the House will continue to pass legislation that stops government abuse and waste. The IRS, like all federal agencies, should be held accountable for their actions.	440386589427862
242042855928904	Today I voted against raising the debt ceiling because it included no meaningful measures to curb our national spending.

390419731073316	Today I voted against the bill to fund DHS through September 2015 – the end of the current fiscal year.  I am opposed to the President’s executive actions granting amnesty from deportation for millions of illegal immigrants. I believe this action will entice millions more to cross our borders in defiance of our laws.  \n\nAlthough the bill was passed without restrictions on the President's illegal amnesty, the debate is far from over.  A federal judge in Texas has stopped the President's actions through an injunction, and bills such as the Asylum Reform and Border Protection Act, which I introduced last week, will work to substantively address the issues at the heart of the matter.	737319939716625

The IRS has claimed under oath that most of her emails from a key time period were destroyed by a crashed hard drive, that back-up tapes were erased, and were therefore unrecoverable.  Through their ongoing efforts, the Inspector General’s office has discovered that the back-up tapes do exist, the data on them was never erased, and the emails are in fact recoverable.	733219426793343

72680720883	Yesterday, at Frank’s Motorcycles Sales and Services in Essex Junction, Peter highlighted the damage that corn-ethanol is doing to snowmobiles and other small engines including chainsaws and boats.  Here’s what Peter said after announcing the reintroduction of his legislation to repeal the federal requirement to blend corn based ethanol into gasoline:\n\n“The requirement to blend corn ethanol into gasoline has been a well-intended flop. It’s wreaking havoc on small engines across the country, including the engines of snowmobiles.  Ask any mechanic and you’ll get an earful on the serious damage being done to the engines of snowmobiles, chainsaws and boats.  The mandate is also driving up feed prices which is hurting our farmers and contributing to increased food prices. My legislation has broad bipartisan support and would end this misguided policy.” – Peter \n\nLester Pelkey, the owner of Frank’s Motorcycles, demonstrated for Peter the damage ethanol inflicts on engine parts.

72680720883	At the Burlington International Airport this morning, Peter called on Congress to do its job and pass a budget for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Should Congress not approve the agency’s budget by Friday at midnight, it will run out of money resulting in the furlough of 30,000 federal employees and forcing 200,000 employees, including Secret Service agents, Border Patrol officers and TSA workers, to work without pay. \n\nRepublican leaders are using the threat of shutting down the agency to block President Obama from using his executive authority to implement immigration reforms announced last year.\n\n“Republican leaders are once again employing their failed strategy of shutting down government to force the President's hand in a policy dispute.  It didn't work for the Affordable Care Act and it won't work for immigration," said Peter.  "What it will do is force those protecting the lives of the First Family to work without pay.  It will force workers protecting air travelers from threats to work without pay.  And it will force customs and border employees protecting our land borders to work without pay.  Republican leaders should abandon this discredited strategy that will put our homeland security at risk and let the courts sort out the dispute over immigration policy.”   \n\nPeter is a sponsor of a "clean" Homeland Security Appropriations Act (H.R. 861) which will fully fund the Department of Homeland Security without extraneous provisions blocking the President's immigration reforms.	10153673721810884

72680720883	This morning, President Obama sent Congress a plan to authorize the use of force against ISIS. This is what Peter had to say after reviewing the proposal:  \n\nCongress has been ducking its Constitutional responsibility to authorize this war so I am pleased that the President is now forcing Congress to do its job.  However, I cannot support this authorization as written.  It leaves in place the Bush-era open ended authorization that led to so much harm.  And it contains very vague language that leaves open the possibility that a future president could justify the reintroduction of ground troops without geographic limits and without further debate and authorization by Congress.–Peter  \n\n#ISIS	10153637638710884
72680720883	The internet has become indispensable to the free flow of ideas, commerce, education, and participatory democracy. It is essential that it remain open and available to all Americans and all businesses.  Individuals, small businesses and non-profits throughout Vermont depend on the internet for their success.  They should not have to compete for internet access with large corporations who are in a position to negotiate fast lanes of access. – Peter \n\nToday in Montpelier, Peter endorsed the Federal Communications Commission’s plan that would ensure all businesses and all Americans have open and unfettered access to the internet, also known as "net neutrality."  This open internet proposal follows a groundswell of public support for net neutrality last year when nearly 4 million Americans weighed in during the agency's public comment period. Peter convened a roundtable discussion of Vermont small business entrepreneurs at Local64 in downtown Montpelier this morning to discuss this new plan from the FCC.\n\nThe FCC is scheduled to vote on the proposal on February 26th. \nRep. Welch is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over issues affecting the internet. \n\n#NetNeutrality	10153624374660884
72680720883	Peter just introduced a bipartisan bill in Congress that would put an end to the mandate that requires corn-ethanol to be blended with gasoline. Here’s what he said at the press conference: \n\n“The Renewable Fuel Standard is a well-intentioned flop. The corn-based ethanol mandate is driving up the cost of feed for struggling dairy farmers. It’s driving up the cost of food for working families. And it’s ruining the engines of boats, chainsaws and snowmobiles in Vermont and across the country. Our bipartisan coalition has made tremendous progress unwinding this failed policy. This bill will remove the remaining consumer subsidy of the ethanol industry, the mandated blending of ethanol into gasoline.”	10153619619010884
72680720883	Peter just introduced bipartisan legislation called the Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act (GPS Act, HR 491).  The legislation creates clear rules about when law enforcement agencies can access and track Americans’ location from a cellphone or other mobile device.\n\n“Cell phones are in the pockets and purses of most Americans,” said Peter. “While tracking technology has transformed our lives in many positive ways, it also poses a risk to privacy through potential misuse of tracking data.  The time has come to modernize our statutes to reflect the technology of our age.  This bipartisan legislation protects Americans’ right to privacy while ensuring law enforcement officials are able do their important jobs.” \n\nCourts have issued conflicting opinions about whether the government needs a warrant to track Americans through their cell phones and other GPS devices. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 2012’s U.S. vs. Jones case that attaching a GPS tracking device to a vehicle requires a warrant, but it did not address other digital location tracking, including through cell phones, OnStar systems and consumer electronics devices.\n\nThe GPS Act applies to all domestic law enforcement acquisitions of the geolocation information of individual Americans without their knowledge, including acquisitions from private companies and direct acquisitions through the use of ‘Stingrays’ and other devices.  It would also combat high-tech stalking by creating criminal penalties for surreptitiously using an electronic device to track a person’s movements, and it would prohibit commercial service providers from sharing customers’ geolocation information with outside entities without customer consent.	10153598900970884
72680720883	I am pleased that the President energetically put a spotlight on the most pressing domestic issue facing our country. Revitalizing the middle class is essential to America’s long term prosperity.  While the stock market has rebounded from the financial crisis and unemployment has declined, the paychecks of working Americans are not keeping up with their mounting bills.  Simply put, Americans need a pay raise.  It is essential that this new Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, find common ground with the President to lower taxes on hard working Americans, make child care and college more affordable, and create good jobs by investing in rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure. --Peter \n\n#SOTU	10153582379355884

38932542633	Every year in the United States, nearly 25,000 children in foster care turn 18 and “age out” of the system.  That means that 25,000 children entering early adulthood don’t have a home, a place of support, or a safety net.  Without a permanent family, these children are significantly more likely to become homeless, drop out of high school, and re-enter government systems like juvenile detention centers and prisons. \n\nThankfully, state and private agencies have made finding permanent homes for children in foster care a priority, and have taken great strides toward reducing the number of children in foster care and the amount of time children spend in the system. Every day, young men and women who have entered the foster care system through no fault of their own are finding forever families to help them reach their full potential.  \n\nAs a child of adoption, I know that my adoptive family was instrumental in helping me accomplish my personal and professional goals, and I want every child to have that loving, supportive environment that a permanent family provides.\n\nMay is National Foster Care Month.  And if you are thinking about expanding your family, I encourage you to consider foster care as a way to give hope to some of our most vulnerable children.	10152940514542634
38932542633	From the battlefields of Yorktown to Arlington’s National Cemetery, Virginians are surrounded by monuments and reminders of the significant cost of freedom. During our nation’s 239-year history, countless men and women have answered the call of duty and left their homes and families behind to defend against the enemies of liberty. It is because of these patriots and their sacrifice that the United States continues to serve as a symbol of justice and equality.  \n \nDuring May, we’ve been honoring our military service members all month long, but Memorial Day gives us the distinct opportunity to honor our fallen heroes, and to remember those who gave “the last full measure of devotion” so that we might go on living in the absence of fear. Most of these men and women were young when they died, and as Ronald Reagan said, they gave up two lives, “the one they were living and the one they would have lived.” Our gratitude belongs to them—to those who fought for something they considered more important than life.\n \nThis Memorial Day, join me in honoring our service members who never left the battlefield—who gave their all whether on the beaches of Normandy or the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan—and those who continue to fight for our freedoms every day.	10152920817687634

38932542633	In case you missed it, check out my most recent weekly update: http://1.usa.gov/1GmYuOc\n\nOne of the main functions of any governing body is to plan for the future, and much of the early part of 2015 in Congress has been focused on just that, especially now that the budget process for Fiscal Year 2016 is underway. Of course, the future is never certain, and that is why I have been consistently calling for proper funding for our military, which has already been forced to undergo serious, disproportionate cuts in recent years. Our military leaders have been sounding the alarm about the impacts of defense cuts on our military’s readiness. As Chairman of the House Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I too am determined to make sure my fellow legislators understand the critical nature of this issue.\n\nIn private meetings and public hearings this week and in the last few months, I have met with a variety of our service chiefs and combatant commanders, as well as military civilian leadership and the Secretary of Defense. The dangers of serious defense cuts have been reiterated in each of these interactions. Visits to military installations around Virginia, and across the nation and world, have also reinforced my determination to see that our servicemen and women receive the resources their missions require. Just recently, I was fortunate to meet the skilled folks at U.S. Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base and gain a more solid understanding of how their important work has powerful impacts across the scope of our military’s operations. I also enjoyed meeting with Virginia midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy, and I came away with great comfort in the future of our military’s leaders. It is Congress’ role to ensure that as these midshipmen volunteer to serve their nation, our military is granted the resources necessary to respond to future crises that may arise.  \n\nAs the budget process continues, I remain committed to pursuing a funding level for our servicemen and women that is reflective of a sound strategy to face the rising threats around the world. I have long said that our budget must be dictated by strategy, rather than the other way around. I’ve reiterated this principle recently in speeches to a number of audiences who support our national security infrastructure, from those involved with amphibious warships and the submarine industrial base to the precision strike community. These discussions – and many others like them – have enabled healthy exchanges of ideas about our defense capabilities and the needs of our military. I hope that you will also let me know how you feel about this and any other issues that are important to you as the year progresses.	10152787593967634

Achieving North American energy independence and creating more American jobs are essential to growing our economy and maintaining economic competitiveness in the future. The Keystone XL Pipeline is critical for both of these goals, and I've been proud to support this project at every opportunity. Americans have waited long enough, and I urge the president to sign this commonsense, bipartisan bill.	10152697498222634

38932542633	President Obama seems quite content with our nation’s current state of affairs. However, most folks I hear from don’t express the same level of satisfaction. The president gave little attention to our debt and deficit, which still remain too high. I also didn't hear enough about his plans to facilitate a robust middle class where a path to progress exists through strong career ladders, effective career and technical education, and an economy driven by private sector growth, not government programs. Above all, we must strengthen the opportunity for the middle class to succeed.  \n \nI am relieved that the president acknowledged the challenges ‘beyond our shores.’ There is no question that our world is not getting any safer. And the role of Congress in granting authority to the president to engage ISIS is especially critical. However, the president did not mention the impending cuts to our military budget, known as the sequester, which will be absolutely devastating for our nation’s ability to defend itself. As Chairman of the House Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I am committed to staving off these irresponsible, unbalanced cuts and ensuring that our men and women in uniform are trained and equipped to execute their missions successfully and return home safely. We owe that to them.\n\nAs 2015 kicks into gear, my goal in Washington is to make sure that the job gets done. Our system of government was designed as it was for a reason, and the Congress has a duty to pass responsible legislation that will in turn go to the president for his signature. I am hopeful that the president will work with Congress to achieve smart public policy that enables a robust economy full of opportunity for our citizens. We must put the country on a quick path to a balanced budget and make sure that our government is funded in a timely, long-term manner. Finally, we must ensure that our military’s ability to protect our citizens remains strong and unrivaled.	10152654965927634
38932542633	Tune in to the #SOTU tonight at 9PM, and stay tuned afterward for the GOP response from Senator Joni Ernst.	10152654683327634
38932542633	Good morning! The House is considering legislation this week to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which will certainly have impacts on immigration policy. In preparation for Facebook Friday, I wanted to reach out to you and ask for your thoughts on immigration policy. What types of policies do you support? What do you oppose? I look forward to hearing from you - please keep an eye out for my response!	10152643198842634
38932542633	Wow! What a fantastic group of students from the College of William and Mary! I enjoyed our conversation today. Thanks for all the great questions!	10152632614922634
38932542633	Folks, I wanted to make sure you all had heard my thoughts on the election for Speaker of the House yesterday: \n\nSince being elected to Congress, I have consistently fought for accountability from congressional leadership, demanding year after year that the House eliminate the outdated August recess and remain in session to complete the work we were elected to do. I have also consistently urged a return to regular budget order, in which a budget resolution and funding bills are passed on a regular schedule in order to provide certainty and transparency, both of which are missing when Congress funds the government using massive, irresponsible funding bills such as the one passed in December.\n\nThese positions have not necessarily made me popular with congressional leadership, but I believe in doing what is right. The Speaker of the House takes direction from the House Republican Conference, and it is the responsibility of every member of the Conference to hold congressional leadership accountable to the people. \n\nThat being said, John Boehner was the only candidate to put his name forward for Speaker when the Republican Conference met in November to discuss this critical, important position. None of the other candidates put their names forward more than three business days before yesterday’s vote, which did not allow for a fair, open, and honest debate. What’s more, none of the other candidates even contacted me to ask for my vote or explain to me their vision for battling executive branch overreach and passing responsible legislation to get our country back on track. Theirs were not serious campaigns for Speaker – they were merely symbolic. I have heard consistently from my constituents that they do not want me to take symbolic votes. Instead, they want meaningful action. \n\nNo matter who is in the Speaker’s chair, my focus is on representing the people of Virginia’s First District and on upholding our Constitution. I have shown that throughout Speaker Boehner’s tenure, and I will continue to do so during this new session of Congress.	10152630319822634
38932542633	Happy New Year to you and your family! I wish everyone a happy and healthy 2015!	10152598650387634
38932542633	Restoring the Chesapeake Bay has been one of my top priorities since coming to Congress seven years ago. I am thrilled that the President signed my Chesapeake Bay Accountability and Recovery Act into law this week. The Chesapeake Bay is one of our nation’s prized historic resources, and this initiative will help to ensure that this national treasure can be enjoyed for generations to come.  \n\nThe Bay Accountability Act wasn't the only bill of mine to be signed into law this week. The President also signed the Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act, a bill to modernize the historic federal duck stamp program. This is a tremendous step forward for waterfowl and wetlands conservation efforts.	10152566467017634
120068161395562	Wishing all of those beginning the celebration of Hanukkah tonight a safe and happy holiday!	749053391830366
38932542633	Folks, I've been hearing loudly from constituents about the president's recent executive action on immigration, in which he granted legal status for nearly 5 million undocumented individuals. I wanted to reach out and hear from as many people on this issue as possible, and therefore I put out a survey yesterday. The overwhelming number of respondents indicated that they did not approve of the executive actions recently taken by the President to change immigration law. Today, we'll be voting on a bill that states the President does not have the authority to pursue this unconstitutional action. Prior to the President's announcement, I expressed my strong objection to him acting unilaterally to change immigration law. I reminded folks of the President's own words in 2013, when he acknowledged that he is not "the emperor of the United States" and that there is a process by which to pursue changes in immigration law. He acknowledged this again in the same year, saying that "there is a path to get this done, and that is through Congress." I do believe strongly that any change to immigration law, such as the President's effort through executive order, requires congressional action. When I examine our broken immigration system, I believe we must secure the border, enforce existing law, and fix the broken visa system before we can effectively address undocumented individuals or pursue other immigration reform efforts. I do not support amnesty in any shape or form. Congress must continue to work to address the President's unconstitutional actions. I believe that it is our constitutional duty to do such. Congress is also currently determining the mechanism by which we can prevent the implementation of the President's executive order. We must make sure that we do not shut the government down in any effort we pursue in addressing the President's executive order on immigration. Thanks, Rob	10152536524842634

167851429918010	Happy birthday to the U.S. Navy Hospital Corps! For 117 years, these brave men and women have fought alongside our troops on the front lines and provided aid in our nation’s most critical hours. Our office’s hard charging Marine Fellow, Mark, said, “These guys are awesome. They fight alongside us, patch us up, and keep us going.” If you know a member of the Navy Hospital Corps – take a moment to thank them today for all they do to keep America safe and free!	660716153964866

167851429918010	Congratulations to the Nansemond-Suffolk Academy class of 2015 graduates! My advice to the seniors as they begin the next chapter of their lives: "Let your graduation mark a commitment to lead by listening to others; In doing so you will find that others will seek out your counsel. Let your graduation mark a commitment to lead by example; In doing so, you’ll find your career path will be illuminated with opportunity. Let your graduation mark a commitment to lead with a servant’s heart; In doing so, you will find true fulfillment."	656023881100760
167851429918010	Shook hands with two real American heroes today. CAPT Mulligan (seated closest to me) is a WWII, Korean War and Vietnam war veteran who was a prisoner of war (POW) for 7 years. The gentleman pictured to his left, George Coker, was also a POW in Vietnam. Join me in thanking these patriots for their service to our country.	654452267924588
167851429918010	I am often reminded - particularly today - of the very special role our region has served in defense of our country, one marked with a disproportionate loss of life. For the Gold Star families among us - those who lost a loved one in service to our country - every day is Memorial Day. Today I had the opportunity to join some of these families at the Norfolk Memorial Day Ceremony and Trail of Honor Dedication, and thank them for their service and sacrifice. The Trail of Honor, now displayed in downtown Norfolk, is a tribute to the nine Norfolk native or resident service members who have earned the Medal of Honor since the Civil War. \n\nYou can visit the memorial on Wisconsin Square: http://www.13newsnow.com/story/news/military/2015/05/18/trail-of-honor-salutes-heroes-from-the-past/27552879/	653687844667697

167851429918010	Teri and I are deeply saddened at the loss of life in Philadelphia yesterday, which included a Naval Academy Midshipman. Our prayers are with those who were injured and the first responders on the scene – and we especially pray for the families who lost loved ones.	649560415080440
167851429918010	Join me in wishing moms everywhere a Happy Mother's Day!  Today we especially thank those moms serving in our military, who are away from their families right now, and the moms who have raised fine men and women who fight for our country. Finally, let's pray for our Gold Star moms, who have given their most precious gift in the name of our freedom.	648200741883074
167851429918010	Spouses of service members wear a lot of hats – they care for our families, protect our American soil during war, chaos, and long deployments, and they serve as beacons of hope and joy for our troops as they defend our freedoms overseas. And that’s just scratching the surface! Today is Military Spouse Appreciation Day – please join us in thanking our Gold and Blue Star spouses who, for generations, have selflessly and bravely sacrificed so much to keep our great nation free. We tip our hats to our very own Military Liaison, Bre Kingsbury, who is a Navy wife of 11 years and has tirelessly been the #1 advocate for our military community in Hampton Roads!	648172911885857

167851429918010	I'm currently at the H.E.L.P. (Hampton Roads Ecumenical Lodging and Provisions) Center - a day center that provides assistance to homeless men and women in Hampton, some of whom are veterans. Really proud of the work they are doing at this facility, including their partnership with AmeriCorps NCCC (National Civilian Community Corps) to help transition veterans to permanent housing.	647912108578604
167851429918010	Today we celebrate two important homecomings: Virginia National Guardsmen from the Virginia Beach-based 529th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, 329th Regional Support Group returned this week from Kuwait, and the USS Mitscher (DDG 57) will return to her homeport at Naval Station Norfolk on Sunday. Teri - and all of Team Rigell - joins me in thanking you for your brave service in defense of our freedoms! While we celebrate this homecoming, we are mindful of the men and women who remain deployed and on the front lines around the world, and those who have given their last breaths in defense of our freedoms.	646173985419083
167851429918010	As a drummer (and former Marine!) the Virginia International Tattoo is one of my favorite events. Tattoos - or ceremonial performances of military music by massed bands - evolved from a European tradition dating back to the 17th Century. Virginia's Tattoo is the largest show in the U.S. If you love music, you'll love the Tattoo. Learn more here: http://www.vafest.org/2015/about-tattoo	644990568870758

167851429918010	This #EarthDay - I'm grateful for OYSTERS! (And the invitation to attend the VES Land Trust Oyster Roast last Saturday – Teri and I had a blast.) If we work together, we can protect our nation's beautiful resources - like the bays, rivers, and inlets that produce such tasty oysters in VA-02 – while meeting our obligation to leave clean air, water, and soil for future generations of Americans. Significant progress toward that goal has been made. We’ve re-opened almost 50% of the Lynnhaven River to shellfish harvest; restored underwater grasses along the Eastern Shore; and oysters are surviving better than they have in decades. Let’s keep up the good work!	643201489049666
167851429918010	This was one of those weekends you wish wouldn’t end! My staff let me out of my business suit just long enough to play in Priority Auto’s Charity Bowl (go #teamGRANDSLAM!) - I even got to drum a set with the band! \n\nI also had the opportunity to roast my longtime friend and colleague in the business community – Paul Hirschbiel – at the Horizons Annual Charity Roast and Toast. When Paul asked me to roast him this year, the answer was easy: without a doubt, ‘YES’! The preparation was just as easy too – believe me, there was NOT a shortage of material! What a fun night for a great cause. You were a really good sport, Paul!	639974036039078
167851429918010	Eleanor "Ellie" Friel (pictured here) will be 93 years old this year and was a member of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) as an observer and a scanner for the duration of WWII. The extraordinary men and women who served in the Civil Air Patrol – all civilians - volunteered their time and resources to help the military with tasks such as sinking U-Boats and rescuing crash victims. The risk level was high – and many in the CAP service paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedoms. This past weekend, I was honored to shake Ellie’s hand and present her with the Congressional Gold Medal for her service to our country.  Ellie – and each of our nation’s veterans – have truly met their duty to our country and have my eternal respect and gratitude.	637648286271653

356330225020	Enjoyed meeting with Jim and Leslie Wheeler, as well as Corey Holeman, all of whom own several McDonalds franchise locations in and around the Fourth District. We talked about the issues they face as business owners – taxes, regulations, immigration policies – but most of all, I was impressed by their optimism as they look to the future. Our American entrepreneurs truly are one of the greatest assets of our economy.	10154010284560021

356330225020	Great time at the Norfolk Ship Repair Centennial Celebration on Saturday.The ship repair industry is one of the largest employers for Hampton Roads. Pleased to be able to chat with some of the BAE Systems Ship Repair employees whose dedicated efforts makes the important work done by our shipyards to support the U.S. Navy possible.	10153951540745021

356330225020	Great news for our veterans -- the Hampton VA Medical Center will open a new community based outpatient clinic later this year in Chesapeake.  It will serve roughly 6,000 veterans who otherwise would have to travel to Hampton for care.	10153908193400021
356330225020	Deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Bruce Compton, one of the founders of WCTV-Chesapeake Television. My thoughts and prayers are with Bruce’s loved ones, friends, and the entire WCTV family. Bruce is someone I was privileged to call a friend, and he will be missed.	10153898386015021
356330225020	Tune in to the Fox News Channel at 4:50PM this evening to watch as I join Neil Cavuto to discuss the testimony given by the Secretary of Defense yesterday. \n\nWe will also be discussing the President’s comment that he should have closed GITMO on his first day in office -- weigh in with your thoughts below.	10153872811555021
356330225020	Good news for Greensville County: This week, 510nano Incorporated, a developer of renewable energy projects and technologies, announced it will invest $11 million to relocate its headquarters and establish a manufacturing operation in Greensville County.

356330225020	Snowy morning on Capitol Hill – and I know the 4th District is getting even more weather than Washington. What does it look like out your window?	10153824129040021
356330225020	Good news today on the passage in the House of HR 529, which will improve college savings and prepaid tuition plans and make them more flexible. 529 plans are a great tool to help families save for college expenses. With nearly 12 million accounts open, it's clear many hardworking families have found 529 plans to be a practical way to invest in their children’s future and help send them to a higher education institution of their choice.	10153822981330021
356330225020	In case you missed it: on Friday, the Army announced it will award Fort Hood terror victims with Purple Hearts. This step is long overdue, but well deserved. We cannot go back and change what happened on November 5, 2009 -- when a brutal terror attack was carried out at Fort Hood and 14 people lost their lives -- but we can ensure that the brave men and women who both risk and sacrifice their lives for this nation, are properly honored. We are grateful.	10153786271630021
356330225020	ISIS has released another video of its barbarism and the civilized world is staring evil squarely in the eye. Simply pretending we’re facing “man-caused disasters” and acts of “workplace violence” instead of globally ambitious Islamist jihad will do nothing to prevent further atrocities or protect the U.S. Only a concerted strategy to militarily and financially dismantle ISIS will ensure our national security.	10153773565740021
356330225020	How we treat those who have worn our nation’s uniform defines us as a country. The compensation and benefits that our servicemen and women have earned, whether competitive pay, a strong military commissary system, robust healthcare options, or the promise of a dignified retirement, are essential to retaining our current personnel and attracting future recruits. Earlier today, the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission released a report recommending changes to the compensation and benefits of active-duty and retired military personnel.  These recommendations are just that—recommendations. Given the serious national security challenges facing our country, I remain opposed to changes to our compensation system that break faith with our warriors and jeopardize the All-Volunteer Force that has served our nation so ably.	10153763770935021
356330225020	In one word, how would you describe the state of our union today, compared to last year? #SOTU	10153744536915021
356330225020	For the past six years, this nation has endured an Administration marked by unconstitutional executive overreach, a dangerous weakening of our national security, a disastrous healthcare law, and the continuous expansion of government tentacles into the lives of its citizens.  Those of us who have fought this Administration's policies have done so from the vantage point of controlling only the U.S. House of Representatives.  Our bills have died in the Senate.  Our leverage has been severely limited. \n\nWith the start of the 114th Congress, however, that changed.  This week marks a significant shift in the balance of power and a marked opportunity - and responsibility - to move this nation in a different direction.  \n\nWhile the start of a new Congress begins with a vote to elect the Speaker of the House, traditionally this is a perfunctory vote, reaffirming a vote of the Republican Conference that was made months before.  Such a vote is taken in advance of the new Congress to allow the Speaker adequate preparation and planning to take the helm of one of the most important jobs in the U.S. government.  It takes weeks, if not months, to hire all the staff and do the planning to start a new congressional term – the new Speaker is in charge of all of that. When the Republican Conference held such a meeting last year, on November 13, 2014, any Member of Congress could have run for Speaker, yet no candidate other than John Boehner stepped forward for consideration and Mr. Boehner was unanimously selected.\n\nIn the few days leading up to the January 6th affirming vote, several candidates abruptly announced that they were altering their vote for Boehner and putting their name forward for Speaker.  Mr. Yoho of Florida announced his desire for the position 65 hours before the vote.  Just 53 hours before the vote, Mr. Gohmert of Texas put his name in the ring. Mr. Webster of Florida announced he wanted the position of Speaker only about an hour before the vote was taken.  None of these candidates outlined a vision, let alone articulated a plan for this significant position. None stood before the Conference and responded to questions about staffing, strategy, and their preparation to lead.\n\nThe Speaker is the third highest elected public official in America.  Just as many citizens are outraged that Members of Congress are asked to vote on bills that they have barely had time to read, should not this same standard be applied to the candidacy of an individual seeking to be third in line to the Presidency?  Every vote - whether for a bill or for a leader - should involve transparency and robust dialogue.  The discontent of conservatives with current leadership has long been evident.  Every alternative candidate for Speaker had the opportunity beginning in November to announce their candidacy, articulate their vision, and participate in a serious debate of ideas; I am sorry to say that none did.  \n\nAs you know, Mr. Boehner was elected Speaker.  Rep. Louie Gohmert received 2 votes in addition to the vote he cast for himself; Ted Yoho garnered 1 vote in addition to his own vote; and Daniel Webster, whose candidacy for Speaker became public an hour before the vote, attracted 11 other Members to support his candidacy.  \n\nI understand the deep frustrations of many conservatives when they look at the dysfunction in Washington.  They feel their country is slipping through their fingers.  I have shared that frustration and I have disagreed with current House leadership multiple times over both the strategy and the substance of their actions. However, given the choices, I believe I chose the most viable option in John Boehner. This decision was based on the lack of vision and plans from other candidates, the inadequate timeframe of their candidacies, and my sincere belief that the election of any ill-prepared Speaker would serve to benefit President Obama and his policies far more than to advance conservative ideas. If someone can only garner two votes out of 435 Members of Congress, how could they possibly expect to lead the House of Representatives and actually have the hope of getting anything done? So many people tell me they are tired of symbolic votes. They say they want to actually get things done; and I agree.\n\nAddressing the vast overreaches of this Administration will require tenacity as well as unity.  As we move into the 114th Congress, you can count on me to utilize my position to spur the tenacity of House leadership to fight this Administration with persistence, doggedness, and strategic wisdom.  You can also count on me to continue to use my position to build strategic unity among conservatives - to remind us of the power we can harness in working together towards our common goals of advancing personal liberty and protecting constitutional rights.\n\nWith tenacity alone, we will not be effective enough.  With unity alone, we will not be aggressive enough.  Exercised in tandem, however, we can be both aggressive and effective -- and we will have one of the greatest opportunities to re-chart the course of this nation.	10153709489430021
356330225020	Merry Christmas to you and your loved ones. Grateful for all those who are far from their families today, serving our country.	10153663858220021
356330225020	No words to describe the horrific act committed by the Taliban, who took the lives of over one hundred innocent children and teachers. Prayers from around the world are with the loved ones and families today.	10153637538335021
356330225020	ACTION ALERT: Tomorrow, the House is expected to vote on The Executive Amnesty Prevention Act (HR 5759). This bill, which I am supporting, affirms that, except within strict constitutional limits, the President does not have the authority to exempt whole categories of persons unlawfully present in the US from removal or defer that removal. Any executive action to the contrary is a violation of the law and thus has no legal effect. \n\nThis applies not only to the Administration’s recent action on immigration, but also to any future actions by any Administration that circumvent the law. It’s about principles, not politics.	10153608035300021
120068161395562	I was honored to speak at the commencement ceremony at Hampden-Sydney College in Farmville this afternoon. Congratulations to all of those who graduated today.	822524721149899

120068161395562	I was disappointed by the President’s decision to veto the Keystone XL Pipeline this afternoon. Representatives and Senators from both sides of the aisle were able to come together to pass this bipartisan bill, sending it to the President’s desk. It is high time that President Obama also comes to the table to work together with both sides of the aisle to create American jobs, lower gas prices, and strengthen our national security.	784978998237805
120068161395562	Each day, but especially on this day, we solemnly recall the contributions and legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. This year we also remember his determination fifty years ago in the Selma to Montgomery marches and the role these demonstrations played in the fight for equality for all. Today, as we honor Dr. King, let us remember his quest for justice and freedom, and his fight to be sure all Americans have the opportunity to live the American dream.	768600339875671
120068161395562	Our national debt stands at $18 trillion and counting, which translates to more than $65,000 in debt for every American household.  We need significant fiscal reforms to tackle our debt crisis, which is why the first piece of legislation I co-sponsored in the 114th Congress is a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  This amendment would set us on a path toward fiscal sustainability by requiring that the federal government not spend more than it takes in.  I look forward to continuing the work we in the House of Representatives have done to cut spending, and I remain committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make the tough decisions necessary to preserve this great nation for our children and grandchildren.	762863070449398
120068161395562	On this day 73 years ago, our nation was attacked at Pearl Harbor. It is a date which lives in infamy, as Franklin Roosevelt eloquently described. I hope you will join me in honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice protecting our nation.	744334792302226
120068161395562	In 1619, a group of English settlers arrived on the banks of the James River just north of Jamestown, right here in Virginia, and they issued a charter stating that their arrival shall be observed yearly as a “day of thanksgiving.” Today, we celebrate that tradition, reflecting on all the things for which we are grateful.  Wishing you and your family a safe and enjoyable Thanksgiving.	737046659697706
120068161395562	Today, Robert participated in the American Legion Veterans Day Ceremony in Charlottesville, where he thanked the brave men and women in uniform who have sacrificed selflessly to preserve our freedoms.	729726673763038
120068161395562	Yesterday, Robert spoke at Hampden-Sydney College's 16th Annual Veterans Day Ceremony, thanking all of those who are and have been members of our armed forces and remembering with gratitude the brave men and women who have sacrificed their lives while defending our great nation.	729283857140653
120068161395562	Today, Robert attended the NASCAR race at Martinsville Speedway.	722035751198797
120068161395562	Last night, Army veteran Sam Farris of Hurt was presented with long overdue medals, including a Purple Heart, that he earned for his distinguished service to our nation in Korea and Vietnam. Robert had the honor of also presenting him a flag that had been flown over the U.S. Capitol.	721305231271849
120068161395562	Today marks the 200th anniversary of the British naval attack on Fort McHenry during the War of 1812. American forces withstood a 25 hour bombardment, and as the smoke cleared on the morning of September 14, 1814,  Francis Scott Key saw the American flag flying intact atop the Fort. This inspired him to write a poem that would later be renamed the Star Spangled Banner. Ever since, his words have served as a national symbol, uniting Americans through a common anthem.	701208673281505
120068161395562	In remembrance of the thirteenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Robert released this statement:\n\n“On September 11th, 2001, our country was struck by an unspeakable tragedy. Each day, and especially on this day, we remember the nearly 3,000 innocent lives lost 13 years ago in the terrorists attacks in New York City, in a peaceful field in Pennsylvania, and right here in our beloved Virginia at the Pentagon. We also remember United States Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and the three other Americans who lost their lives in the attack on the U.S Consulate in Benghazi two years ago today.\n\n“Yesterday, I had the privilege of attending the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony in honor of the Fallen Heroes of 9-11. It was a meaningful opportunity to observe the heroic sacrifice of the all of the men and women killed in these devastating attacks.\n\n“We grieve all of the lives lost that horrific day and honor their tremendous sacrifice. Let us take time today to thank our first responders who put others before themselves each day and all of the brave men and women in our military and intelligence communities. Their great sacrifices are the reason we continue to live in peace and in freedom, and we are forever grateful for their service.\n\n“As we remember that day and honor those we lost, I hope that Americans across this country will join together in a shared commitment to preserving and protecting our freedoms, ideals, and our American way of life.”	700375556698150
120068161395562	Please join me in observing a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. in remembrance of those we lost on Sept 11, 2001.	700354660033573
120068161395562	Today, we celebrate the hard working American spirit. We must continue to strengthen our economy to provide opportunities to all those still searching for employment. Have a safe and happy Labor Day!	695860333816339
120068161395562	Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Lt. Col. Morris Fontenot, Jr., who passed away in the F-15C crash near Deerfield.	694644367271269
120068161395562	Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and all of those affected by the devastating storms on the Eastern Shore this morning.	677677155634657
120068161395562	When divided equally among all citizens, our nation’s staggering $17.5 trillion debt amounts to $55,260 in debt for each and every American.  We must continue to put an end to reckless, excessive government spending, balance our budget, and pay down our debt to give our children and grandchildren a better future.  Like this if you agree.	676776749058031
120068161395562	Robert attended a ceremony at the French Embassy in Washington, D.C. in honor of World War II veterans who received the French Legion of Honor, the highest decoration in France, for their service on D-Day. Captain John Leys of Charlottesville was awarded with the Legion of Honor today for his role in liberating France from Nazi German occupation: http://1.usa.gov/1suvluu	674684872600552
120068161395562	As we celebrate our nation’s Independence Day, let us remember the great sacrifice our Founding Fathers made in pursuit of freedom. May we also honor those who have faithfully served so that we may remain free and enjoy our American way of life. Have a safe and happy holiday weekend!	668413466561026
6459789414	Had a great time at Military History Weekend at Ridgeview Park in Waynesboro!	10153584463579415
6459789414	Pleased that the Senate acted wisely to proceed with debate on the USA Freedom Act. This decision is long overdue. However, I'm disappointed that the Senate has stalled and will not vote on it tonight. Because of Senate’s irresponsible inaction, three national security provisions will expire at midnight. I urge the Senate to act as expeditiously as possible to approve the USA Freedom Act, without amendment and without delay, so that we protect Americans’ civil liberties and our national security.	10153571313884415
6459789414	Tragic loss for the family of Vice President Biden yesterday. Our prayers are with them during this difficult time as they grieve the loss of his son, Beau.	10153570006329415
6459789414	Tune in Sunday morning - I'll join CNN New Day live around 8AM on the USA Freedom Act. The Senate has the opportunity to pass this strongly bipartisan bill that provides civil liberties protections and ends the bulk collection of data.	10153569350964415
6459789414	Best wishes to Sam Pereles, Kyoko Leaman, Eujine Kim, & Mary Elizabeth Vaughan who are representing the Sixth District in the National Spelling Bee this week! A great achievement for them.	10153546099079415

6459789414	Earlier this week, a bipartisan bill to help fight human trafficking was passed by the House. The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has lead efforts to enact these protections. Today, I had the opportunity to attend the signing of this bill by Speaker Boehner. I'm glad this important bill is now heading to the President's desk.	10153527655589415
6459789414	Stopped at Elkton Middle School today. The food service staff told me about the challenges federal regulations place on them as they try to provide food that is nutritious and that the students will actually eat. Thank you for welcoming me!	10153469983879415
6459789414	Thank you to the Advance Auto Parts HQ in Roanoke for hosting my visit yesterday. It was great to speak to so many employees there and hear more about the work they are doing in the Sixth District.	10153469137409415

6459789414	Drug Enforcement Administrator Michele Leonhart announced today that she will step down. The DEA’s pattern of protecting its own agents at the expense of transparency and justice must end. A change in leadership at the DEA is warranted. Tune in to Lou Dobbs Tonight at 7PM for more on this and the Administration's continued failure to follow the rule of law.	10153451412834415

100123453059	I introduced legislation this week that would establish a Presidential Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics Reform. This blue ribbon commission of members of Congress and sport and education experts would objectively identify and study concerns related to the intercollegiate athletic system and offer recommendations for reform.\n\nRecent scandals involving intercollegiate athletics programs at a number of the nation’s most prestigious institutions reveal the absence of policy and practice that would ensure a level of academic integrity, athlete welfare, and financial soundness appropriate for non-profit institutions of higher education. We must give our universities and membership associations the tools they need to sustain a healthy intercollegiate athletic program that benefits the university and protects its student athletes. The challenges of reform are so complex and important to higher education that a blue ribbon commission of experts and members of Congress should be convened to objectively study these concerns and offer recommendations for reform.\n\nAs a former college athlete, I am deeply concerned about the welfare of our student athletes and the sustainability of our college sports programs. Despite piecemeal efforts at reform, we still see gaps that leave our student athletes vulnerable, whether through due process or appropriate health protections. The graduation rates of players in the Football Bowl Subdivision are still twenty points below their male campus peers and worsened in the past three years.\n\nWe have a system now where in 40 states, the highest paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach and yet only 20 schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision have athletic departments with revenue exceeding expenses. In fact, most schools are losing money. The average loss among the Power 5 conferences was $2.3 million in 2013 and universities are pulling a larger percentage of institutional funds to cover the loss.\n\nWe know our intercollegiate athletic system is broken. Scandal after scandal in the news continues to undermine our faith in the integrity of the intercollegiate athletic system. It’s time to put our experts together and put us on the path to tangible reforms.	10152943561208060

100123453059	Tragedy struck Arlington, Shanksville, and New York City 13 years ago today.  Thousands of innocent lives were lost that terrible day, and in the aftermath that committed us to two wars, thousands more have died.  All of these losses weigh heavily on our country.  It is easy to remember the sadness and heartbreak many of us felt on September 11th, let us not forget this loss, but let us also honor the sacrifice of so many brave first responders and the men and women in our armed forces, who put their lives on the line for others.  Their dedication and sacrifice reflect what is best about America.	10152777848318060

100123453059	LBJ signed the Wilderness Act into law 50 years ago, bequeathing to us a lasting legacy of the natural world.\n\nThe Wilderness Act protected nine million acres of pristine land, largely unaltered in its original and raw beauty since America’s first settlers crossed its grounds.  In the ensuing five decades, another 30 wilderness bills have become law, designating 758 wilderness areas, and protecting 110 million acres of land in the United States, about 4.5 percent of the country.  \n\nAs we celebrate its 50th anniversary, let us ensure our conservation laws and their positive impact on our country are themselves preserved for future generations.	10152758635288060

100123453059	Thank you all for your kind words about Mame. She was an incredible woman.	10152546162368060
100123453059	I loved Mame.  She was an indomitable force of personality and determination, always loyal, always committed to the principles of fairness and compassion.  She’s the one who convinced me to run for Congress in the first place.  She was my Campaign Manager and Chief of Staff and most importantly, my friend.  She always had my back and I’ll miss her dearly.	10152542252988060
100123453059	Governor McAuliffe last week announced a sales tax holiday to promote storm preparedness. Emergency supplies that cost less than $60 will be exempt from Virginia’s sales tax from May 25 – 31. Virginians should stock up on all essential materials during this time – bottled water, batteries, canned food, manual can openers, first aid kits, and duct tape. Generators under $1,000 are also eligible for the sales tax holiday.\n\nRead the rest of my op-ed here: http://goo.gl/W4M3Ue\n\nLearn about Gov.

100123453059	This May, we celebrate Clean Air Month to educate Americans on the positive impact clean air has on their health and our environment.\n\nSince 1970, the air we breathe has been protected from harmful pollutants that are detrimental to our health and our nation’s delicate ecosystem. Using the Clean Air Act’s authority, President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have strengthened limits for particulate matter and mercury and have proposed, for the first time, to limit carbon emissions.\n\nhttp://goo.gl/Wk7lmW	10152469733953060

141893975868919	As we observe Memorial Day, perhaps by spending time with family and friends, may we pause to solemnly remember and honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving our country and defending our liberty.  To those who have answered the call to serve, whether in times of war or in times of peace, we are forever grateful.  My thoughts and prayers today and always are with those who gave their lives in defense of our nation, with those who served and continue to serve, and with their loved ones as well.  Best wishes for a safe, happy, and meaningful Memorial Day.	905221932869449

141893975868919	Enjoyed spending time on Friday in Buchanan County planting trees with sixth graders on a reclaimed mine, and speaking with students at Twin Springs High School in Scott County.  Also, thanks to Haysi's Mayor Yates, who was so hospitable to me and my team between events.	893757574015885
141893975868919	Enacted nearly 100 years ago, the federal estate tax, commonly known as the ‘death tax,’ is imposed ‘on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the United States’ (26 U.S.C. § 2001a).  This is a significant burden on Americans seeking to pass down their small business or family farm to the next generation.\n\nI have long opposed the death tax, and supported legislation while serving in the General Assembly that repeals the Virginia estate tax for the estates of those who pass on or after July 1, 2007.  This was the right thing to do.  I am proud today to have voted for H.R. 1105 to repeal the federal death tax policy, and will continue fighting to grow our economy and protect American families, farms, and small businesses.	888513831206926

141893975868919	For those of you who receive my weekly e-newsletter, you may recall that over Thanksgiving, I told the story of Congressman Alan Nunnelee (R-MS) and his illness, and how he was facing each day understanding that while we may not be thankful for hardships such as tumors, strokes, etc., we ought to be thankful in all situations for our blessings and that with which we have been provided in order to deal with health scares and other tribulations. I am sad to report that I received the following email from the Nunnelee family today: “Congressman Alan Nunnelee has gone home to be with Jesus.  He was well loved and will be greatly missed.”  My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, constituents, and staff.	851047618286881
141893975868919	Rep. Griffith today joined Congressman Bob Goodlatte and others at a ceremony recognizing Roanoke resident Wesley Hillman for his service with the Civil Air Patrol during World War II.  House and Senate leaders last year presented a Congressional Gold Medal in honor of members of the Civil Air Patrol, but Mr. Hillman was unable to attend that presentation.

141893975868919	Marking the beginning of summer, Memorial Day for many is filled with outdoor barbeques, trips to the pool, and parades.  Most importantly, however, Memorial Day is when we pause and remember those who paid the ultimate price in defense of the American Dream.\n\nWe owe our freedoms and way of life to these brave men and women who stood together in defending us all, and to their families as well.  On this day and others throughout the year, we remember the fallen heroes and those who currently serve for their efforts in keeping us free and our nation strong.\n\nMay God continue to bless these United States.	712217922169852

335759964938	I’m pleased that OPM is continuing the successful Feds Feed Families food drive, which I helped launch six years ago.  Over that time, more than 24 million pounds of food have been donated by federal employees to food banks across the country.   I also appreciate Virginia First Lady Dorothy McAuliffe’s leadership on the Summer Meals Program to help provide food assistance to Virginia students from low income families during the summer months.  Many are unaware that food donations are significantly lower in the summer – at the same time need is highest.  I encourage all Virginia communities to support their local food banks and food pantries.

335759964938	Last year, the USDA reported a record number of Americans are struggling to put food on their tables.  Across the nation, 49 million people – including 17 million children and 6 million seniors – are going hungry, a number that has grown substantially over the last two years. I have long believed that Virginia can and should do more to fight hunger.

335759964938	As many of you are aware, earlier this month, the Obama Administration announced its decision to postpone enforcement of the employer mandate in the president’s health care law for one year.  Yesterday, I voted in support of suspending both the employer and individual mandates in the law.  The two bills, which passed the House yesterday, would reaffirm the administration’s decision and would also help business and families who will be hit hard with the burden of complying with the law’s complex provisions.  The administration decided to delay the employer mandate for businesses on July 2 – it’s only fair that individuals receive the same delay.   I have long believed that the law, while well-intentioned, is unworkable and unaffordable.  That is why I will continue to vote to repeal, defund and delay the implementation of this health care overhaul and replace it with a better alternative.	10151720839504939
335759964938	With Tropical Storm Andrea moving up the coast, I am pleased that the Obama Administration finally agreed to my repeated requests to move around existing funding to prevent furloughs at the National Weather Service.  Although the administration initially refused to work with Congress on this issue, they reversed course after the two deadly tornadoes in Oklahoma last month.  By preventing furloughs at the Weather Service, we can ensure that the agency is fully staffed and prepared during tornado and hurricane season this year.  This decision will also allow the Weather Service facility in Sterling to continue to operate at full force.	10151635478544939
335759964938	This afternoon Attorney General Eric Holder will testify before the House Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations subcommittee, which I chair.

335759964938	Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of yesterday’s terrorist attack in Boston, their families, and the medical professionals and first responders who acted swiftly and bravely in the face of unexpected horror. \n\nOur brave nation has survived and even thrived in the face of adversity and terrorism, and we will do so again.  The abundant instances of unity, heroism and strength displayed by the spectators, medical professionals, local government and first responders in times like these will always trump the evil acts of one person or group.  To the people of Boston, who have always represented true patriotism and the American spirit from our earliest days: You have the unwavering support of all Americans, and we stand together with the promise to bring justice to whomever is responsible for yesterday’s unspeakable acts.  Our prayers are with you.\n\nThe Boston police tip line is 800-494-8477.	10151546700384939
335759964938	Today, I announced my support for the new budget outline by Republican Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles to prevent sequestration and get our nation’s fiscal house in order.  Like the original Simpson-Bowles plan, the new framework would put everything on the table and require compromise from both sides of the aisle.  Additionally, this framework would avert sequestration by calling for smart, targeted reforms to reduce spending, rather than the currently scheduled blunt, across-the-board approach.	10151455485074939
335759964938	Last night, I offered a bipartisan amendment to avert sequestration that would require President Obama to incorporate the Simpson-Bowles recommendations into his budget submission to Congress.  Tomorrow, I will speak on the floor on behalf of the amendment when it is considered on the House floor.	10151409506129939
335759964938	This week I am traveling in the 10th District meeting with high school students.  I am currently at James Wood High School and I visited Sherando High School this morning.  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to talk with students at Centreville High School.  I am enjoying these visits and learning from the 10th District’s students.	10151334684919939
335759964938	With the 113th Congress convening for the first time this afternoon, I want to share that I am an original cosponsor of the Balanced Budget Amendment, which will be reintroduced today by my Virginia colleague, Bob Goodlatte.  I am proud to once again represent the citizens of Virginia’s 10th District and I remain committed to cutting spending and balancing our nation’s budget.	10151321219589939
335759964938	This afternoon I met with former Senator Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, co-chairs of the Simpson-Bowles Commission.  At the meeting, they urged Congress to “go big” and support comprehensive budget reform to get our nation’s fiscal house in order.  I am committed to solving this budget crisis and that is why I was one of only 38 House members to vote to put everything on the table for discussion to identify at least $4 trillion in deficit reduction.	10151260435159939
335759964938	Now that autumn is upon us, I am pleased to be hosting a Fall Cover Photo Competition on my Facebook page.  \n\nIf you would like to share a photo of the beautiful fall scenery in the 10th District - including Clarke, Fairfax, Fauquier, Frederick, Loudoun, Prince William and Warren counties - please send your photo submissions to va10photos@gmail.com.  \n\nPlease be sure to include the name of the photographer and a description of where the photo was taken along with the photo submission.  The winning photo submissions will be displayed weekly as my Facebook page cover photos over the next few months.  \n\nI look forward to seeing your outstanding photos during this special time of year.	10151164087044939

335759964938	I am deeply saddened and outraged by the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the other Americans serving at the U.S. embassy in Libya.  My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this attack.  We honor these Americans, along with our men and women in uniform and all federal employees on the front lines of duty, who have sacrificed to defend democracy and keep us safe.	10151144703464939
335759964938	As we recognize the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks tomorrow, we remember all of those whose lives were lost in the attacks on the Pentagon, World Trade Center and in Pennsylvania – including many from the 10th District.  We also honor and recognize the brave men and women in our armed forces who have fought and sacrificed in Afghanistan and other fronts in the fight against terrorism.  \n\nIt is imperative that we continue to learn and improve our counterterrorism operations, especially given the number of domestic radicalization-related terrorism plots in recent years. That is why I have called for – and introduced legislation – to bring back the chairs of the 9/11 Commission for a period of time to report on what additional steps we can take to ensure to protect the U.S. from terrorism.	10151142005489939
335759964938	Yesterday the U.S. Treasury Department reported that the national debt has topped $16 trillion – a 50 percent increase over the last four years alone.   We cannot afford to continue down the current fiscal path.  That is why I have continually supported every effort to “go big” and cut our debt by trillions of dollars through spending cuts and tax reform, including the bipartisan budget substitute based on recommendations by the Simpson-Bowles Commission.	10151134975289939
335759964938	Wishing everyone a safe and happy Independence Day.  Today we celebrate the birth of our country and the principles of freedom for which our nation stands - "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."  We also remember those who have served - and sacrificed - for our Independence and continued freedom.	10150996980669939
335759964938	I am disappointed in the court’s ruling and continue to believe that the president’s health care bill is not only unaffordable but an inappropriate expansion of government.  Simply put, our country cannot afford this $1.76 trillion bill.\n\nWhile our health care delivery system is far from perfect, I believe this law should be repealed and replaced with a better solution.  We should keep what’s good, such as covering pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents’ health care plan, and drop what is bad, such as the requirement that individuals purchase insurance and its numerous tax increases.\n\nI did not support this bill when it was approved in March 2010 and have voted to repeal more than two dozen times.  I will vote to repeal it again when it comes before the House on July 11.	10150984129279939
335759964938	This month, I will be hosting a Cover Photo Competition on my Facebook page for constituents to share photos of their favorite locations in the 10th District.  Please submit photos taken in the 10th District to va10photos@gmail.com and include the name of the photographer, a short description of what is pictured and an explanation of why the photo is important to you.  At the end of the month, my office will select four winning photos and each photo will be displayed as my Facebook page cover photo for one week during the month of July.  I am eager to see photos of the 10th District places and communities that are important to you.	10150922607119939
335759964938	As part of an ongoing effort to help American manufacturers, I included language in the FY 2013 Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill that was approved by the full House last week, requiring that promotional items for the Commerce and Justice Departments as well as NASA and the National Science Foundation be made in America. This “Buy USA” provision will ensure that the U.S. government is buying goods made by American manufacturers as much as possible and help create jobs here in America.  Please share your thoughts and comments on the “BUY USA” provision in the thread below.	10150875478524939

177164035838	Congressman Connolly released the following statement in advance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Joint Session Address:\n\n"I will attend the Joint Session of Congress of March 3, 2015 to receive the remarks of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. I will attend as a symbol of my lifelong commitment to the State of Israel and the enduring relationship between the United States and that state.\n\n"Nevertheless, the process employed by Mr. Netanyahu and his Ambassador, Mr. Dermer, to secure this privilege (to address a joint session) is deeply offensive and hurtful. It has driven a partisan wedge where none has ever existed before, it has provided a gratuitous insult to our head of state, and bypassed any reasonable norm of diplomatic protocol.\n\n"Unfortunately, this confrontational style has characterized the Netanyahu approach to our government since the Clinton Administration. I fear it can only damage Israel’s own long term interests even if it benefits Mr. Netanyahu’s short term electoral goals with Israel’s pending elections exactly two weeks away.\n\n"This is a shameful episode that diminishes the serious issue which ostensibly has caused Mr. Netanyahu to push aside diplomatic niceties; namely the Iranian nuclear negotiations. By acting in such a blatantly partisan way, Mr. Netanyahu has diluted the focus from that central, existential issue, to one of parochial partisan politics - his and ours."	10153374011230839
177164035838	My statement in opposition to the House Energy and Water Appropriations bill:\n\nOnce again, the House Majority has presented an appropriations bill that disinvests in American research and development, innovation and the exploration of clean and renewable energy sources, bakes in sequestration cuts, and continues their unrelenting assault on clean water and clean air protections.\n\nThis legislation slashes clean and renewable energy funding by more than $279 million from current spending, while increasing fossil energy accounts by $34 million. It cuts $81 million from solar energy, $16 million from wind energy, and $21 million from the building technologies account.\n\nWe can, and must, be willing to make strategic investments, especially in the technologies of tomorrow. Unfortunately, this legislation falls far short of that goal.\n\nMoreover, the Majority’s continued willingness to attach dangerous policy riders demonstrates their unprecedented effort to inject Congress’ will outside its purview.\n\nFirst, they tried to get into the local permitting process by forcing states to accept the Keystone XL pipeline. Repeatedly, they’ve tried to tell the District of Columbia, and its constituents, how they can govern. Now, they wish to halt federal rulemaking prescribed under the Clean Water Act, almost a decade in the making and after more than a million public comments and numerous public hearings and stakeholder meetings, just before a final rule is released.\n\nCongress has a role to play. But it shouldn’t be an obstacle to public health and a 21st century clean energy economy.	10153546295725839
177164035838	Joint statement issued by Reps. Gerald E. Connolly (VA-11th), Donald S. Beyer Jr. (VA-8th), Barbara Comstock (VA-10th), Steny H. Hoyer (MD-5th), Chris Van Hollen (MD-8th), Donna F. Edwards (MD-4th), John P. Sarbanes (MD-3rd), John K. Delaney (MD-6th), Eleanor Holmes Norton, (DC- At-large)\n\nWe are deeply disappointed by the House Appropriations Committee’s proposal to cut $75 million in grant funding for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro).\n\nProviding anything less than the federal commitment of $150 million would jeopardize rider safety and the successful partnership with Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia to fund the purchase of new rail cars and vital safety improvements throughout the system in response to NTSB and FTA recommendations. The proposed reduction would only exacerbate the operations and safety issues that our delegation has been working with Metro to resolve.\n\nSince 2009, Congress has worked in bipartisan fashion to fulfill its annual commitment of $150 million, which is matched by $50 million each from Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, under a partnership created by the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act (PL 110-432).\n\nIt would be shortsighted for Congress to threaten to unravel this partnership given the federal government’s unique relationship with and responsibility to Metro. Nearly 40% of rush-hour riders are federal employees, and half of all Metro stations are located on federal property. Metro is also a critical component of the National Capital Region’s emergency response system.\n\nWe respectfully urge our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, as they prepare for the full Committee markup, to maintain our commitment to our state and local funding partners, and work with us to ensure robust oversight of Metro’s ongoing efforts to address financial and safety concerns identified by the FTA and NTSB.	10153542337715839

177164035838	It’s time for House Republicans to stop using the Department of Homeland Security as a political hostage in their standoff with President Obama.\n\nIn just the past few weeks, we’ve seen the shocking reminders of the threats at our door and the urgent need to ensure the Department of Homeland Security is equipped to respond.\n\nIf House Republicans once again push us over the brink – just as they did in October 2013 when they shut down the entire federal government for 16 days – the Department of Homeland Security will be forced to furlough 30,000 employees.\n\nVirginia is home to more than 17,000 DHS employees. Most of them, and the bulk of the DHS workforce, will remain on duty as essential personnel, but they will have to do so without pay, leaving those families to wonder how they will make ends meet.\n\nWe face real challenges safeguarding Americans, whether they are at home, traveling through our airports, or in cyber space.\n\nWhen it comes to securing their safety, our residents should expect action from their elected leaders rather than political posturing.	10153360390770839

177164035838	The Obama Administration’s short-sighted decision to open drilling off Virginia’s coastline will pose significant threats to Virginia’s coastal economy, our natural resources, and jeopardize the Navy's presence in Hampton Roads for nothing more than a few days of national oil and gas supply. Clearly the risks of drilling in this sensitive region far outweigh any benefits. \n\nIt is disappointing and ironic that while the Obama Administration took an important step in protecting 12 million acres of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge they are willing to expose Virginia’s barrier islands, our wildlife, estuaries and natural resources, and much of the Eastern coastline, to this very same threat. I will continue to urge the Department of Interior to reconsider this dangerous decision.	10153275384445839

Tonight, President Obama gave us a road map to achieve those goals.	10153258840400839

135654683137079	The House voted on three measures today related to the President’s trade agenda.\n\nFirst, I voted in favor of but the House defeated a measure to fund a program that assists workers whose jobs have been negatively affected by trade, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program (TAA). In recent years, TAA has helped nearly 2,900 workers in the Second Congressional District and more than 17,500 workers in Washington state with job training and income support. You can read more about TAA here: ow.ly/2ZQdg4. I strongly support renewing this program, and I am deeply disappointed that my colleagues voted against a program Democrats started 40 years ago to help people who are hurt by trade. The House is set to reconsider this measure as early as next week. It must pass before the whole package of trade bills can go to the President for his signature.\n\nSecond, I voted in favor of and the House passed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which would give the President authority to finalize trade agreements. I believe presidents should have the authority to negotiate new trade agreements based on Congressional direction, which is laid out in the TPA bill. I also support the 2015 TPA bill because trade matters for the Second Congressional District and for Washington state. You can read more about the ways trade benefits our local economy in my statement here: http://1.usa.gov/1QaIIaD.\n\nThird, I voted for and the House passed a bill that strengthens enforcement of trade agreements and gives U.S. Customs and Border Patrol more tools to manage the flow of goods across our borders. Some have said this bill includes language that will keep the U.S. from addressing climate change. This is not true. Nothing in the bill prevents the U.S. from negotiating climate change treaties, trade agreements with environmental protections, or from taking action on climate change. I see trade agreements as a clunky way to address climate change, and I think there are many other more effective ways, such as climate change treaties, to work with other countries in reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. My assessment is that the language added to the customs enforcement bill is not a hurdle to further action to address climate change.	861760177193189
135654683137079	One piece of the President’s trade agenda the House is set to vote on soon is the renewal of a program called Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), which helps workers whose jobs have been negatively affected by trade. Part of the cost of that program was set to be covered by a cut to Medicare providers. People shared concerns with me about using Medicare to pay for TAA.\n\nI have listened to these concerns, and I helped find a solution. I signed a letter to House leadership asking for a different way to pay for TAA. In response, House leaders struck a deal to use revenue from better tax code enforcement to fund training and other benefits for workers whose jobs have been negatively affected by trade.\n\nToday, I voted for and the House passed a bill approving this new way to pay for TAA. This means the tax enforcement revenue completely replaces Medicare cuts, so Medicare cuts will not be used to pay for TAA.\n\nSome will say this fix is not real because Medicare cuts are still included in the TAA bill, but this is not the case. The bill the House approved today supersedes the Medicare cuts and uses better tax enforcement as funding for TAA.	861155373920336
135654683137079	People have asked me about how trade agreements will be enforced, and whether people can trust the U.S. to carry out enforcement actions.\n \nI understand that some past trade agreements have not been enforced well enough, and that enforcement actions have taken too long. The 2015 Trade Promotion Authority bill takes steps to improve how we hold other countries accountable for what they have agreed to. The administration would be required to have a plan in place for how it will enforce trade agreements. And the U.S. would invest more in helping other countries improve their ability to enforce trade agreement standards, such as protections for workers and the environment.\n \nI also am cosponsoring two bills that would further improve our country’s enforcement of trade agreements.  One bill, the STRONGER Act (H.R. 1947) would direct penalties we collect from other countries’ trade violations to better carry out enforcement activities. The other bill, the Green 301 Act (H.R. 1946), would help our country enforce environmental rules. The bill would give the administration tools to ensure other countries apply environmental rules consistently and fairly, and that those who break the rules are penalized.	860103787358828
135654683137079	I was pleased to have the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) join me to hear from local manufacturers and the fishing industry about the effects exporting and trade have on their operations. We got to see research on ocean acidification in progress at NOAA's research station in #Mukilteo, and we heard presentations from student robotics engineers from #Whidbey Island and student researchers in #Everett. During a roundtable with members of the fishing industry, we talked about how exports affect seafood catchers and processors, which employ more than 15,000 people in our state.	845199205515953
135654683137079	My top priority is to invest in the foundation of long-term economic growth that creates jobs and opportunity in the Pacific Northwest. And when we help our businesses sell their goods overseas, we create jobs here at home. That is why I am focused this week on meeting with local businesses who are exporting their products all over the world to learn more about their opportunities and growth, as well as their challenges. Today I met with Pacific Northwest raspberry growers, as well as wood-products manufacturer Pacific Woodtech in Burlington. I also spoke with the Rotary Club of Bellingham about creating jobs through investing in our transportation infrastructure and helping businesses expand to new markets.	844701228899084
135654683137079	I attended the welcome ceremony at the White House this morning for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Prime Minister Abe talked about the revitalized alliance between the U.S. and Japan, our trade relationship and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the hard work over the last two years that culminated in his visit to the U.S. We also heard from President Obama about the importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship. You can see a few pictures below from the event.	840629029306304

135654683137079	A few people who attended my town halls asked me about the highly partisan atmosphere in Congress. My view is that the harder you work, the better your odds of getting things done. I’m working on a number of bipartisan bills right now, including one to increase access to meals during the summertime for kids who need them, a bill to help our small distilleries grow and create more jobs, and a long-term reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. I am committed to finding solutions for people in Northwest Washington, and I welcome the chance to work in a bipartisan way to grow our economy and create opportunity.	831888346847039

135654683137079	The safety of crude oil traveling by rail came up at some of my town halls last week. I share people’s concerns, which is why I have worked so hard over the last year to meet with officials at all levels of government, first responders, and industry experts to put in place stronger standards for tank cars, make sure rail lines are well maintained, and ensure first responders know how to handle a potential accident. I also took a position on the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials subcommittee to give me more oversight of our country’s rail lines and better position me to help strengthen the rail in infrastructure in the Pacific Northwest. I expect the U.S. Department of Transportation to put out new safety rules soon. I’ll be looking at these rules closely to make sure they translate into safety on the rails.	831741983528342
135654683137079	The best way I know to create jobs and a strong economic foundation in the Pacific Northwest is by investing in our transportation infrastructure. At my town hall meetings last week, I shared some of the ways I’m working to improve our local roads, bridges, highways and transit systems. For example, my TIGER CUBS bill would help small and mid-sized cities, like Mountlake Terrance and Sedro-Woolley, land the big-time funds they need to repair and build up their roads. I am also pushing to improve our bridges here at home and nationwide, and to make sure everyone on our roads, including bicyclists & pedestrians, are safe.

135654683137079	The Pacific Northwest is home to many innovative manufacturers that create jobs and build a diversity of products for sale here in the U.S. and abroad. One of these manufacturers is TSI Inc. in Lynnwood, which designs technology to create wood pellet energy products out of wood waste. I toured the company's reactor that is testing these products for use as an alternative energy source. I support innovative technologies like this one that create clean energy jobs and keep our region strong.	819673328068541
135654683137079	Peoria Home in Everett is working to provide housing and support services to women who have been victims of trafficking or who have a history of prostitution. I met with Peoria’s founder and a Snohomish County Sheriff detective this week, and I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about the organization and the ways it is building opportunity for the women it will serve. Organizations like this one are critical to breaking down barriers for all people to fully participate in our economy and our democracy. Like and share if you agree.	818929421476265
135654683137079	Today marks the 50th anniversary of the landmark civil rights march in Selma, Alabama, when peaceful demonstrators calling for the right to vote were brutally attacked by local police. It was a dark day in our country's history. The violence and hostility those courageous protesters endured changed the course of the civil rights movement in America, and the Voting Rights Act became law five months later. We have made great progress, but discriminatory laws still block some citizens from the polls. I will keep working to break down barriers like voter ID laws that keep people from participating in our democracy. Like and share to commemorate the contributions that civil rights advocates like the Selma marchers have made to our country.	817247064977834
135654683137079	The House chose the responsible path to governing today by passing a bill to fund DHS through Sept. 30. This vote means people will stay on the job, and they will get paid for the work they are doing when they are doing it. It also means we can put behind us this game of jeopardizing thousands of people’s jobs and our national security, and get to work on many important issues Congress needs to address, such as investments in transportation and education.	815956631773544
135654683137079	The responsible way to govern is to pass a DHS funding bill through Sept. 30. Let’s keep people on the job and pay them for the work they are doing when they are doing it.The three-week funding bill I voted against earlier today was the irresponsible approach to funding our homeland security needs, continuing to jeopardize thousands of people’s paychecks and our country’s safety. I stand ready to get this funding bill done so DHS can do its job for the American people, and I hope Republicans will join me.	814208448615029
135654683137079	Today President Obama vetoed a bill that would have approved construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, as he said he would. I support his veto and agree with him that we should let the pipeline review process play out, which is why I have voted against approving the pipeline three times in recent months. Like and share if you agree.	812725352096672
135654683137079	I continued my record of votes against the Keystone pipeline today. If job-creating infrastructure investments are a goal in this country as they are for me, we should be focused on new roads, bridges, highways and transit systems to keep our economy moving. \n\nWe also should let the pipeline review process play out, and require TransCanada and other companies that ship and refine tar sands oil to pay into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. These companies currently do not have to contribute like all other conventional crude oil companies do to help the federal government respond to oil spills and to protect the environment and communities near pipelines. Like and share if you agree.	807543862614821
135654683137079	I voted today for two bills that would better protect children from the appalling crimes of human and sex trafficking. These bills make sure children are no longer criminalized for being victims of trafficking and better equip states to support children who are victims. I know organizations in Northwest Washington are working hard to raise awareness about and prevent the problem of human trafficking and to care for its victims. I appreciate their work to keep all people, including children, safe from trafficking.	801274733241734
135654683137079	I voted no again today on the Keystone XL pipeline. We should let the pipeline review process take its course, as the President has said he will do. The bill the House passed today also exempts TransCanada and other companies that ship and refine tar sands oil from paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. These companies should contribute like all other conventional crude oil companies do to help the federal government respond to oil spills and to protect communities near pipelines.\n \nWe also have little evidence that the pipeline will have an effect on gas prices in our country, or on overall employment. If we want a real jobs plan, we should invest in building up our country's roads, bridges, highways and transit systems. Like and share this post if you agree.	793579114011296

135654683137079	Momentum is on the side of our economy. Great news to report for people in Northwest Washington and across the country.\n\nFirst, employment. Our economy created 2.95 million jobs in 2014, which is the most of any year since 1999. That has pushed the unemployment rate down to 5.6 percent, its lowest level since mid-2008.\n\nSecond, the Affordable Care Act is working. The uninsured rate in our state is down to 10.7 percent, from 16.8 percent a year ago, according to Gallup.\n\nThird, families have more money in their pockets because of falling gas prices. The average price of gas in Washington state is down to $2.40 a gallon, nearly $1 less than a year ago and $2 less than high prices from 2008, according to AAA.\n\nEven with all of this good news, I know there are still people who are struggling. That is why I am working to keep the momentum going and create jobs by investing in our roads, bridges, highways and transit systems, and by helping our businesses sell their goods, not our jobs, overseas. Like and share if you agree.	793512330684641
135654683137079	I have received some questions about what the recent defense policy bill the House passed, called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), does for military readiness and for veterans. \n\nThe bill, which I voted for, includes a 1 percent pay raise for our women and men in uniform. It also protects the DOD commissaries from cuts and makes important investments in efforts to improve servicemembers' mental health and prevent military suicide.\n\nVeterans benefits are funded in a separate bill, which I also voted for. That bill included $193 million to digitize benefits information to reduce the disability claims backlog and funded programs to help homeless veterans.\n\nBeyond these bills, I work year-round to make sure veterans can access the health care, housing, jobs and education they need. For example, after I heard from an Island County veteran about a discrepancy between current medical assessments and the disability rating she received, I successfully pushed the VA to make sure they use the best medical information to assign disability ratings.\n\nI also continue to hear concerns about  the long time it's taking for veterans to get decisions about their benefits, and I will keep pushing on the VA to ensure veterans can get the care they need in a timely way. A new law Congress passed a few months ago includes money to hire more doctors and medical staff, and it allows veterans who live more than 40 miles away from a VA facility to get care with doctors who serve the general public. These are good steps, and I will be monitoring the VA's progress closely to make sure the new law translates to more timely health care for veterans.\n\nYou can read more about my recent work for veterans here: http://1.usa.gov/1wfRBpb.	776288729073668
135654683137079	My no vote against the Keystone XL pipeline last week was a vote to protect our environment.

7507129675	In the past 20 years, the World Wide Web has connected communities and improved the lives of all Americans.

7507129675	Today, the House passed two permanent tax relief measures to provide small business owners in Central Washington with the certainty they need to grow their business and create much needed jobs.  I supported these bipartisan bills and urge swift passage in the Senate.	10152935057899676
7507129675	Today, the House of Representatives passed legislation that I cosponsored that gives veterans who live in rural areas access to care from their local health care providers instead of traveling hundreds of miles to the closest VA facility – something I have long supported. The bill also gives veterans who have been on a lengthy waiting list access to local non-VA medical facilities. Although much more needs to be done to ensure our veterans receive care when they need it, this is a good start.	10152930184979676
7507129675	Last night, the House of Representatives passed a bill, which I am a proud cosponsor of, to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the World War II members of the “Doolittle Tokyo Raiders” for their heroism, valor, and service to the United States. We owe our World War II veterans – and all our veterans – a debt of gratitude for their service to protecting our great nation.	10152875046204676
7507129675	This week, I voted to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify about the IRS’s targeting of conservative groups. I also voted to create a select committee that will be in charge of getting answers surrounding the September, 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, where the death of four Americans could have been prevented. The American people have the right to know the truth about the actions of their government, and when our government fails us, it must be held accountable for its actions.	10152846865934676
7507129675	I would like to give a special thank you to all of the teachers in Central Washington for inspiring the leaders of tomorrow. #ThankATeacher	10152839343464676
7507129675	I am extremely disappointed to hear the Obama Administration intentionally withheld relevant documents surrounding the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, even after the House of Representatives subpoenaed the White House for the documents a year ago. The American people have a right to know all of the facts. This ‘most transparent administration in history’ has continued to mislead Congress and the American people. Be certain that I will continue to support this Congressional oversight investigation and to press this White House for answers until the entire truth surrounding this terrorist attack is revealed. I stand with Speaker Boehner’s calls for Secretary of State John Kerry to testify before Congress on this important issue, where the loss of a U.S. Ambassador and three other Americans could have been prevented.	10152828298529676
7507129675	This week, the House is scheduled to vote on the “Save American Workers Act,” a bill that I cosponsored. It reverses the Obamacare provision that defines “full-time employment” as only 30 hours per week and restores it to the traditional 40-hour work week. This provision in Obamacare is forcing some employers to reduce their workers’ hours below 30 because they cannot afford to purchase health insurance mandated by the federal government. As a result, employees’ take-home pay is less, making it difficult for them to support themselves and their families. This legislation will provide more job security, consistent working hours, and predictability for hardworking Americans when trying to determine Obamacare coverage.	10152755889094676
7507129675	Today, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan unveiled a responsible 2015 budget plan that builds on House Republicans' plan to grow the economy and create more #jobs by targeting the drivers of our #debt, repealing #Obamacare, and lowering tax rates for everyone. Specifically, our solution balances the #budget in ten years without raising taxes, cuts wasteful government spending, strengthens Medicare for future generations, and ensures our troops and veterans have the support they need. I look forward to supporting this plan that helps get Americans working again and creates a better path forward for our children and grandchildren.	10152753511354676
7507129675	Today was supposed to mark the last day to sign up for Obamacare, but the Obama Administration once again showed that Obamacare is fundamentally flawed by extending the deadline and deciding not to enforce its own law. It’s unfortunate that the American people continue to the pay price for this bad policy through higher premiums, cancelled plans, and loss of doctors. I continue to support common-sense, patient-centered health care reforms that take the government out of your health care decisions. The White House continues to believe the government-knows-best by singlehandedly delaying and making changes to this broken law, making life harder for all Americans.	10152751344454676
7507129675	The “Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act,” a bill that I’m proud to cosponsor, unanimously passed the House of Representatives last night. This legislation protects volunteer firefighters and emergency responders from the crippling effects of Obamacare. It will ensure that volunteer emergency services will not shut down due to the increased health care costs associated with implementing Obamacare. I urge the Senate to act on this important and commonsense legislation.	10152707315209676
7507129675	This morning, I attended the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Republicans hearing on the investigation into the IRS, which targeted Americans for their political beliefs. I'm disappointed that Lois Lerner, the former director tasked with determining organizations' tax exempt status, again refused to answer any questions today. I'm also disappointed that the IRS is not cooperating and not providing requested e-mails critical to this ongoing investigation. The American people have a right to know all the facts and the House will continue to fulfill its Constitutional duty of holding the Obama Administration accountable for their excessive overreaching actions.	10152689392014676
321618789771	Starting my Facebook Q&A in just a few minutes! I’ll answer as many questions as I can in the next half hour. Please feel free to ask about jobs and the economy or anything else of interest. Look forward to hearing from you!	10152767338514772
7507129675	I’m pleased to hear the president signed the Farm Bill into law today, giving much-needed certainty to farmers and growers in Central Washington. As with any compromise, the bill is far from perfect and more can certainly be done, but I’m pleased to see the largest commonsense reforms to farm and nutrition assistance programs in U.S. history are now law. This bill consolidates more than 100 programs and saves American taxpayers billions of dollars of their hard-earned money. It also continues important investments in agricultural research, specialty crops, pest management, and trade promotion programs that are critical to ensuring our farmers can continue to compete worldwide. I commend the House Agriculture Committee and Chairman Frank Lucas for their hard work throughout this process.	10152624540869676
7507129675	I would like to congratulate the Chiawana High School Riverhawks on winning the Washington state 4A football championship!	10152471902524676
7507129675	I'm saddened to hear of the passing of Nelson Mandela. My thoughts are with his family and the people of South Africa.	10152460490189676
7507129675	Please join me today in celebrating National Rural Health Day. Healthcare professionals in Central Washington greatly improve patient-centered care and reduce costs for those living and working in rural or medically under-served areas. They deserve our thanks.	10152421390279676
7507129675	Today, I voted in favor of the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act to cut down on the number of frivolous lawsuits that clog the system and waste taxpayer dollars.	10152401126324676
7507129675	A government shutdown is not sustainable for our community or our nation − neither is blindly continuing down the path of spending more than the government has each year. The Senate’s short-term plan was not the solution I would have written. While far from perfect, this deal is a temporary necessity to get the government up and running again. I have voted more than 40 times to repeal, defund and dismantle Obamacare, and the fight to reverse the skyrocketing costs and loss of benefits that Obamacare has inflicted on American families is far from over. \n\nIn the coming weeks, I will continue to advocate for real reform that reins in our national debt by addressing runaway spending, makes the federal government operate within its means, and provides fairness for our job creators and all Americans under the law.	10152313562979676
7507129675	Thankful for the U.S. Capitol Police and law enforcement for keeping the public safe each and every day. Our thoughts are with all of those involved and the police officer injured in today's incident on Capitol Hill.	10152281419944676
7507129675	Truly tragic news coming out of Washington, DC today. My thoughts are with all involved at the #NavyYardShooting this morning.	10152237892884676
7507129675	I would like to wish everyone a Happy 4th of July.  237 years ago, our Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, and today we celebrate the freedoms that they fought for.	10152047038074676
7507129675	My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the 19 courageous firefighters who tragically lost their lives while battling the Yarnel Hill fire in Arizona last night.	10152041561604676
7507129675	With the Obama Administration continuing to show the mishaps of a broad over-reaching government, it’s the job of Congress to provide oversight and hold the Administration accountable. As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Republicans, I am working with my colleagues to ensure that the American people have an efficient and effective government that works for them. This week, House Committees are holding 30 hearings on government accountability and demanding answers from the Administration on the IRS targeting scandal, the Benghazi terrorist attacks, and the looming implementation of Obamacare.	10151977413634676
321618789771	Running a few minutes late due to votes on the House floor -- but I'm now ready to answer your questions.	10153435882749772
321618789771	Cole and I were happy to be back with our friends at Autism Speaks this morning. No parent ever wants to hear that their child will face challenges different than their peers. But with the right love, care, and advocacy, children with disabilities can live fruitful lives.	10153435414239772
321618789771	"Seeing is believing" at  Sweet Frostings. Blissful Bakeshop -- they're using the Internet to share these delicious cupcakes. \n\nExcited to highlight Spokane small businesses and learn how they are using the Internet to drive business success!!  #CrawlSpokane	10153381734379772
321618789771	At the Spokane House of Charity this morning, impressed by the significant work they are doing. \n\nEvery day they provide basic necessities for physical survival, including daily meals, medical care, mental health counseling and case management, housing, shower and toilet facilities, laundry, clothing, and more. \n\nThey provide for immediate needs while helping people find long term housing solutions.	10153377224554772
321618789771	It's great to see Spokane native Tyler Johnson play so well in the #StanleyCup Playoffs. Best of luck tonight, Tyler!	10153371079809772
321618789771	Earlier this year I had the tremendous honor of speaking with World War II veteran, Pearl Harbor survivor, and Spokane hero, Bud Garvin, at his home. Bud passed away this week, and I will be forever grateful for his service to our country.\n\nDuring today's Facebook Q&A, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the VA and share with you some of the work I'm doing to advocate for Eastern Washington veterans in Congress.	10153299875409772
321618789771	Time and time again we’ve seen federal regulations get in the way of job creation and local economic growth in Eastern Washington. That’s why I’m proud to advocate for rural communities all across our region by increasing transparency in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s ‘rural’ classification. \n\nLast night I joined my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in standing up for rural America and cutting federal red tape – because one-size-fits-all regulations do not help communities like ours thrive and grow. Let us continue to grow our economy from the bottom up and create high-paying jobs for people across Eastern Washington.	10153277484374772
321618789771	I’ve worked aggressively to ensure Secure Rural Schools be a top priority in the 114th Congress, because students, educators, and thousands of people from rural communities across Eastern Washington rely on this important program every day. \n\nI’ve used my seat at the Leadership table to advocate for rural America, and I am proud to announce that this week, I will vote to extend Secure Rural Schools for two years -- maintaining our roads, and making sure our classrooms have the resources they need to educate our next generation. \n\nOver a century ago, the federal government made a promise to actively manage our forests for the benefit of rural schools and communities, and we must hold the federal government to this commitment.	10153228110744772
450819048314124	Happy national Pi Day! Only once every hundred years does the date (3/14/15) match up with the first five digits of this special number. At 9:26 am join me (and other proud math nerds) in celebrating this wacky day with a slice of pie.	843900865672605
321618789771	Today I voted to fund the Department of Homeland Security’s lawful operations without providing any funding for the President’s executive overreach on immigration.  As we face rising terrorist threats across the globe, it is imperative we provide long-term certainty to those who defend our national security.  In the weeks leading up to today, I have voted repeatedly to block President Obama’s unilateral action, and I am extremely disappointed by the Senate’s refusal to go to Conference and join us in holding the President accountable.  I sincerely hope the Senate will put solutions above obstruction in the future.  \n\nI remain deeply concerned about President Obama’s executive overreach in your lives – from immigration to health care to telecommunications to overregulation – and I will stand beside my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, in our fight to protect representative government.  As your Member of Congress, I will continue to listen to you, stand up for you, and fight for you.	10153176271934772
321618789771	Two weeks ago, I had the honor of speaking with World War II veteran, Pearl Harbor survivor, and Spokane hero, Bud Garvin. Tonight I voted to help veterans like Bud access quality care – including access to medical foster homes. \n\nWe must continue to hold the VA accountable in order to create a 21st-century agency that prioritizes the safety and well-being of the brave men and women who have served our nation so honorably.	10153174111614772
321618789771	Tonight I voted to protect our national security while also holding the President accountable to the American people. I stand opposed to the President’s unilateral executive overreach on immigration – an action that both blatantly disregards the will of Congress and the American people and represents a step backward on real, long-term immigration solutions. \n\nThat's why I will continue this fight. I will continue to represent the people of Eastern Washington, uphold the Constitution, and listen to the American people.	10153167424029772
321618789771	A vibrant, open, Internet economy creates good-paying jobs and more opportunity for all Americans, which is why I’m concerned by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s decision to regulate the Internet with the same rules used to govern landline telephones. This decision exemplifies why top-down, one-size-fits-all regulations from Washington, DC block the investment and innovation needed to support and grow this critical American resource.\n\nEven more troubling is the Chairman’s refusal to testify in front of Congress about his plan, and the questions about the undue influence exerted by the White House on the FCC – an independent agency. The House will continue to fight a government takeover of the Internet to promote a healthy innovation economy.	10153165283759772
321618789771	The entire Washington Delegation supports the Seattle Seahawks through and through, and we're wagering some of Washington's finest goodies -- Washington State University Cougar Gold Cheese included -- on Sunday's big game! #GoHawks #BlueFriday\n\nRead more about our friendly wager with the Massachusetts Delegation here: http://www.gop.gov/super-bowl-sunday-bets-are-on/	10153104159509772
321618789771	As we convened America’s New Congress yesterday, I joined my colleagues in electing the honorable John Boehner to serve as Speaker of the House. Many of you have expressed concerns about his leadership, and I want you to know that I take your thoughts very seriously. While I do not always agree with Speaker Boehner, his willingness to listen – coupled with his record of results for the American people – speak volumes about his ability to lead this country and this Congress. Under his watch, the House has successfully reduced federal spending, overseeing the largest drop since the end of World War II. And it has been under his leadership that we’ve eliminated earmarks and kept an out-of-control Administration accountable – and that includes leading the vote to repeal Obamacare over 50 times.  I believe that Speaker Boehner is the right man at the right time – to reign in the federal government, hold the Administration accountable, and stand up for the conservative principles that will make your life better. \n\nSo today I welcome America’s New Congress – one that will chart the path toward a government that is more open, transparent, and trustworthy. I will continue to do what you have elected me to do: solve problems and make life better for families in Eastern Washington.	10153050872804772
321618789771	Today marks the beginning of a new chapter for millions with disabilities -- one of opportunity, independence and empowerment.  The President has signed the #ABLEAct into law, and together, we've spoken to give Americans with disabilities -- like my 7-year old son, Cole, a better life.  A life in which those with special needs are not limited by the challenges they face, but empowered because of them. Very proud to celebrate the signing of this landmark law!	10152977155439772
321618789771	The heroes who have served in our armed forces have made tremendous sacrifices to keep America safe, and it pains me to know that between 18 to 22 veterans have committed suicide every day for the past decade. \n\nToday, the House passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act, which works to make sure our veterans have the care that they need when they return home.\n\nThis legislation is named after a Marine veteran who bravely served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and who earned a Purple Heart defending his country. Clay suffered from PTSD and tragically took his life at the age of 28. \n\nCaring for our veterans must always be our priority, and this marks a critical step towards reducing Veterans suicide.	10152954102149772
321618789771	I’m about to start my monthly Facebook Q&A, “This Season of Thanks: Working to create new opportunities for you.” I look forward to hearing about the issues on your mind!	10152911908934772
321618789771	Tonight the Senate sent the bipartisan Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 to the President’s desk, marking a significant victory for working families in Eastern Washington. This bill -- with its commonsense reforms -- reflects the dynamics of a changing, 21st-century workforce. It marks yet another solution to help working families create better lives!	10152906305239772
321618789771	This afternoon I joined my Senate and House colleagues at the White House, where we discussed some of the most pressing issues impacting Americans today – including the economy, immigration reform, the threat of a nuclear Iran, and our efforts to destroy the terrorist threat posed by ISIL. We emphasized that creating good-paying jobs and growing our economy from the bottom-up remains our priority – and it is imperative that we work together to make life easier for you and your families. \n \nWe expressed our firm opposition to the President’s desire for unilateral action on immigration, which would further damage the already fragile trust between Congress and the White House – making it hard to not only act on step-by-step immigration reform, but also on other areas where we might find common ground.  \n \nAfter Tuesday, we have a unique opportunity to advance the priorities that are important to Americans all across this country, and I am hopeful the President will join us in making that happen.	10152885525004772
321618789771	My heart is heavy over this morning's shooting in Marysville. I am praying for those who have been hurt and keeping the students and their families in my heart.	10152854582174772
321618789771	The threat of terrorism is pervasive and it cannot be ignored. That is why I support the President in his efforts to build a broad coalition in Iraq and Syria, and I will work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure he has the support he needs to achieve these objectives.   \n\nBut as we fight a terrorist organization that is stronger than ever before, Americans need more than just rhetoric -- we need a bold, comprehensive, long-term vision that shows our nation's unwavering commitment to fight terrorism at home and abroad.	10152749859134772
321618789771	In anticipation of the President’s speech tonight, I hope he will articulate a clear strategy to combat ISIS and show unwavering leadership in our fight against terrorism.  \n\nWhat do you think the United States should do in light of the terrorist acts committed by ISIS?  Please share your feedback below.	10152749128229772
321618789771	I’m hosting a Town Hall at the Lincoln Center TONIGHT, and I hope you can make it! This is a great opportunity for me to hear from you – and to take your ideas to Congress. It is an honor to work for Eastern Washington men and women, and I look forward to seeing you this evening!\n\nTown Hall details:\n\nMonday, August 18, 2014\n5:00 to 6:00 PM\n\nThe Lincoln Center, \n1316 North Lincoln Street	10152692595114772
450819048314124	I joined our community and Senator Maria Cantwell at the Gig Harbor Sand Spit Transfer ribbon cutting, where we celebrated the transfer of land ownership from the U.S. Coast Guard to the City of Gig Harbor.

450819048314124	We had a blast in the Maritime Gig Parade. Thanks to everyone who waved and may June the 6th be with you!	883599861702705
450819048314124	More than 70 years ago Americans joined Allied troops on the beaches of France to take part in D-Day and begin the long march to free Europe from the Nazi’s grip. So many did so much on that day, and the days following, to defend our nation and it’s ideals. Today we thank everyone who took part for their sacrifice, courage, and heroism. Those veterans will never be forgotten.	883183905077634

450819048314124	Had a great time in Gig Harbor yesterday! I started the morning with a Kilmer at your Company at EF Recovery, a local business that is employing more than 50 people in the heart of downtown. After that I was off to a “Kilmer in your Classroom” up at Gig Harbor High School where I got to chat with AP Economics students about some of the budget challenges facing our nation (I told them that we are all counting on them to solve it – no pressure!) My last stop was at the Russell Family Foundation, a local non-profit that is making great strides in expanding opportunity for the people of our region.	878094742253217
450819048314124	By 2020 there will be 1.4 million new tech jobs. We need to make sure students of all backgrounds who step into the workforce of tomorrow have the skills and tools they need to land these quality positions. That’s why I’m proud to support the announcement that the Congressional Black Caucus is launching CBC TECH 2020, a new initiative aimed at increasing African American representation and inclusion in the tech industry.	875057505890274
450819048314124	It’s great news that CenturyLink has expanded availability of gigabit Internet service to over 5,000 additional business locations across Washington state including in Silverdale and Port Orchard. Right now many communities in our region have trouble obtaining reliable internet access that can help power their businesses or classrooms. It’s time for Congress to support progress like this so that no matter the location, folks have the technological tools they need to get ahead.	874482132614478
450819048314124	Join me in congratulating Dr. David Mitchell of Olympic College for being honored with the CEO Award by the Washington State Association of College Trustees (ACT).

450819048314124	Congratulations to Scott McFarlane of Avalara on being named CEO of the Year by GeekWire. I’m proud that our region is home to businesses like Avalara who are leading the way in innovation! It’s absolutely critical that we continue to invest in technology development to ensure a strong future for the United States job market and global leadership.	872439892818702

450819048314124	One year ago today the Pacific Northwest lost a true legend. Billy Frank Jr. left a legacy of leadership in the Tribal community that won’t be forgotten. There is a Native American proverb that says we should make decisions with an eye toward how they would affect our children seven generations into the future. Billy Frank was an embodiment of that ethos. Now it’s up to us to carry on his fights on civil rights, ensuring America lives up to its tribal treaty obligations, and protecting our natural resources so we can leave a better world to our children.	869511933111498
450819048314124	Today is a day to honor the important contributions that labor unions have made to improve the lives of workers and families, and for their fight on behalf of social justice and greater equality in our community. A big thanks to Tacoma Mayor Marilyn Strickland for proclaiming this day the first annual Pierce County Central Labor Council Day, in honor of the 125th anniversary of the founding of the Labor Council's predecessor, the Tacoma Trades Council.	856100004452691
450819048314124	It’s good news that the Department of Veterans Affairs announced a change to the Veterans Choice Program that will allow more veterans to receive health care close to home rather than driving miles out of the way to a VA facility. This is a step in the right direction but more needs to be done to ensure this program is working for all our veterans on the Peninsula.	849099801819378

450819048314124	This weekend I have the honor of traveling with many of my colleagues to Selma, Alabama to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. On March 7, 1965 hundreds of civil rights activists crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge and were met with brutal attacks by local police. These historic events in Selma led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, legislation that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. \n\nAll weekend I’ll be sharing pictures from my experiences at Selma and other Alabama landmarks from the civil rights movement. Please visit my album titled ‘2015 Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage’ to check in with what I've been up to.	839836479412377
450819048314124	We should all celebrate AmeriCorps VISTA - Volunteers In Service To America on their 50th anniversary -  quite an achievement!  Since 1965, VISTA members have tirelessly worked to build stronger communities in our region, helping to alleviate poverty and building stronger local economies. As a member of the National Service Congressional Caucus I’ll continue to fight for these national volunteer service programs and encourage folks to take part.	839072892822069
450819048314124	The first time I met Adele Ferguson, I was a candidate for the State House. She looked at me, smiled, and exclaimed, "But you're just a kid!" She made all of us raise our game.  She worked tirelessly to hold elected officials accountable.  Sometimes you'd agree with her, other times you wouldn't, but you'd always find her provocative, tenacious, and tough. My thoughts and prayers are with her family.	838451126217579
450819048314124	I would like to wish everyone celebrating throughout our region a happy Lunar New Year! Today we commemorate the beginning of the Year of the Ram.	832351570160868
450819048314124	I had the joy of speaking at the Asia Pacific Cultural Center New Year Celebration. Our region is stronger because of our diversity.

450819048314124	I was proud to vote for the Clay Hunt bill that was signed into law today, that improves mental health care and suicide prevention programs for veterans. We need to continue to have the backs of veterans and servicemembers who serve on our behalf.	828949740501051
450819048314124	I had an excellent time speaking to the business community of Mason County last weekend at the annual Awards and Installation Gala held by the North Mason Chamber of Commerce.

These organizations, businesses, and individuals have made outstanding contributions to the community and deserve recognition.	828226650573360
450819048314124	It was my honor to invite Tacoma’s Reverend Dean Curry to Washington D.C. to open today’s session of the House of Representatives with a prayer. The motto of Curry’s Life Center Church in Tacoma sums up his work “it’s all about the people.” I gave a speech on the floor thanking him and highlighting how just like Congress, his mission is to serve the people. He is an example of how we should do more to listen, respect, and understand one another so we can leave a better place for future generations. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhkLqq_yMD0&feature=youtu.be	825510650844960
91504302598	All of America mourns with the families of the 9 men and women so horrifically murdered last night in Charleston, and our thoughts are with members of their church family at Emanuel AME and the entire community. Nothing can prepare us for such a devastating loss, or to have a place of worship so shockingly violated, and I pray that their murderer is brought to justice. (-Dave)	10153149366227599

I also especially recognize my granddaughter Timary who joins her fellow seniors at Kentlake. She has grown into a beautiful, intelligent young lady who has accomplished so much – including graduating in the top 5% of her class! You have made your family proud, Timary.	10153138295732599
91504302598	The news this morning that the Dallas police department was targeted by gunfire and explosive devices is intolerable. This is nothing short of terrorism and we cannot allow it to continue. Police officers risk their lives each and every day and attacks against them must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  Attacks on them are attacks on every peace-loving, law-abiding American. (-Dave)	10153138254407599
91504302598	Passage of TPA today was critical for the future of America and our global leadership. With this tool in our hands, we can conclude trade agreements that allow Americans the freedom and opportunity to pursue their own choices for the future. They can seek out higher-paying jobs, grow their businesses, and sell the American brand around the world.  I remain committed to fighting for these opportunities for American families, and to working with my colleagues on a way forward on TAA. We must advance the trade agenda to support the hundreds of thousands of jobs in Washington which depend on expanded trade. (-Dave) #TPA4USJobs	10153136451687599

157169920997203	Have great photos of Wisconsin's 8th District?  Share them with me and they might be featured on my Facebook, twitter, and website!   Send photos to photoswisconsin@gmail.com!	775224752525047
91504302598	Every year, we set aside a day to remember the sacrifices of the men and women wearing the badge who gave everything they had, including their lives, to keep others safe. Without them, our communities and our nation would be far less safe. Having served 33 years in law enforcement, this is very near and dear to my heart. Two of my best friends are listed among the names on our national memorial – Sergeant Sam Hicks and Deputy Mike Raburn. There is no higher commendation than to say someone thought more of others than they did themselves, and Sam and Mike deserve that commendation, as they proved it to be the foundation of their lives. This is why I have also introduced a resolution today to express the sense of Congress that law enforcement deserve the utmost respect and recognition. So join me today in remembering the 117 who died in the line of duty last year to protect us, and the 44 who have already died this year. They are gone but not forgotten. (-Dave) #PeaceOfficersMemorialDay	10153054426327599
91504302598	Disappointed by actions of Senate Democrats today, blocking a vote on #TPA4USJobs. Passage of the bipartisan TPA legislation will benefit millions of Americans across the country by helping our farmers, manufacturers, and small businesses gain access to the 96% of consumers living in other countries. We need to pass this bill, and we need to pass it now. We must move forward – it is too important.	10153048118842599

91504302598	Today, on the #NationalDayofPrayer, I pray for peace in our communities and for the men and women in uniform that protect us every single day in our homes, our neighborhoods, and our cities. (-Dave)	10153037172512599
91504302598	Being able to implement Blue Alert Systems more efficiently across the country is one step closer to becoming reality tonight with the passage of the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act in the Senate. I hope the House will take up the Reichert-Cardin legislation soon so we can get it to the White House and signed into law. We have seen, particularly in light of recent events, just how important it is to protect those who spend their lives protecting us. Our nation’s law enforcement officers run towards danger instead of away from it. And sometimes, danger finds them when they themselves are targeted.  We must do everything in our power to ensure their safety, and work together to keep our communities safe all across this country. (-Dave)	10153025519947599
91504302598	Today, the House passed a series of bills that will take great strides towards necessary reforms of the IRS. We have seen the IRS abuse its power for far too long. I and my Ways and Means colleagues have vowed to end those abuses and we will continue to make progress towards ensuring that the IRS works for the American people and not against them. \n\nWe are also reminded today, which some call ‘Tax Day’, of other things that need reform, our tax code is as much in need of fixing as the IRS is. We must reform our tax code so that our businesses have the tools to invest, grow, and hire; so that individuals have more time to spend with their families, rather than figuring out their returns, and more money back in their pockets to put food on the table. It must be fairer and simpler, and I will continue to fight to make happen. (-Dave)	10152986676937599
91504302598	It is with heavy hearts that we mourn the loss of the young family killed in yesterday’s Highway 410 accident in Bonney Lake. Our prayers are with their families and friends, and the entire community.	10152983315742599
91504302598	The shooting this morning of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri is intolerable. More protests and more violence are not the answer. The community and law enforcement must partner together, working with respect and towards a mutual goal. I pray for the swift recovery of the two officers, and I pray that justice will prevail. It is time for peace in Ferguson; it is time for healing. Order must be restored so that, together, we can build a brighter future for our children. (-Dave) #PoliceLivesMatter	10152903984747599
91504302598	As part of #ReadAcrossAmerica, Rep. Reichert joined the third grade at the St. Joseph School in Issaquah to read and discuss the importance of learning and always striving for success.	10152889849552599
91504302598	Today, I stood with House colleagues from both sides of the aisle to pass a bill that will fully fund the DHS through the end of the fiscal year. I believe that this is the responsible way to govern – not playing politics with our nation’s security and protection. There will be an avenue to address the President’s wrongful executive actions on immigration, through the courts and elsewhere, but it should not be used as a tool to jeopardize the safety of the American people. (-Dave)	10152883216682599
91504302598	Today the House voted to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the next 7 days giving us an opportunity to come to an agreement with the Senate on final, yearly funding. This was not how I would have chosen to proceed, as I do not believe we should be playing politics with national security. Our job is to protect, not jeopardize, the safety of the American people. But that is also why I voted for this short-term bill because we cannot allow funding for the DHS to lapse. I will work with and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come to the table and come to a final agreement in the best interests of the American people. (-Dave)	10152874059462599
91504302598	I am thrilled to hear that the PMA and ILWU have reached a tentative agreement, putting an end to the months of negotiation. It is my hope that we can quickly begin to address the backlog of cargo at ports up and down the coast. We have high-quality goods waiting to be exported to countries around the world. While this is promising news, there is further work to be done. We have seen firsthand how important the efficient movement of goods is to Washington’s farmers, workers, and exporters and their ability to grow and succeed. Now, we must turn our attention to ensuring that they are not put in such a situation again. (-Dave)	10152859124472599
288586617834523	In Washington State alone, EX-IM Bank helped to support over 350,000 jobs and billions of dollars in trade in the Ninth Congressional district in 2014.  EX-IM Bank has also helped finance over 3,400 transactions made by American small businesses since 2013, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of the Bank’s transactions.  It also supported over $2 billion in minority-and women-owned business exports in FY 2014 by providing financing and insurance totaling approximately $750 million over the same time period.  I will continue to work in Congress to push for the reauthorization of the EX-IM Bank and I will do all I can to ensure we do this soon. #ExIm4Jobs	1137913069568536

288586617834523	In commemoration of LGBT Pride Month, I recognize the commitment and courage of LGBT Americans and stand in solidarity with them in their fight for equality.  Much progress has been made in recent years, including the end of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’, the legalization of gay marriage in many states, and the Supreme Court overturning of DOMA.  However, there is a lot of work that remains.  LGBT youth are bullied, LGBT employees are discriminated against in the workplace, and some states refuse to allow same-sex marriage.  No one should be denied equal rights because of who they love, and as we celebrate LGBT Pride Month, we must recommit ourselves to fight for freedom and equality for all. #LGBTPrideMonth	1131582870201556
288586617834523	Memorial Day offers us the opportunity to honor the memory of those who have fallen and thank all members of our Armed Services who help keep our country free and prosperous. Let us show our gratitude by continuing to work to make sure all active duty military and veterans receive the support and services that they deserve. #MemorialDay	1125381617488348
288586617834523	Today marks the day that #DAPA would have been implemented.  DAPA is part of the President's executive action on immigration reform that would bring millions of families and children who are part of our communities out of the shadows.  The delay of DACA continues to rip families apart.  I will continue to #Fight4DAPA to keep families together.	1122109881148855
288586617834523	During Women’s National Health Week, our government should be looking for ways to improve access to critical family planning services and protect women’s right to make healthcare choices.  Instead, House Republican leadership has prioritized legislation that would ban a woman’s access to abortions after 20 weeks.  I believe that personal health decisions such as this should be left between a woman, her doctor, and her family; not the United States Congress.  I will continue to support and advocate for policies that protect a woman’s right to choose and improve access to family planning services.	1119410578085452
288586617834523	I am proud to represent one of the most diverse congressional districts in the country. This past weekend, I had the opportunity to speak at El Centro de la Raza’s Cinco de Mayo Celebration at the Jefferson Community Center, as well as at a Bengali New Year ceremony in Bellevue. In my comments, I stressed the importance of passing comprehensive immigration reform and discussed how these types of gatherings are important for increasing cultural awareness in our communities.#CincoDeMayo	1114912018535308
288586617834523	I am glad to see the Senate finally confirm Loretta Lynch as our next Attorney General.  Ms. Lynch, who is the first African American woman Attorney General, has spent her career promoting civil rights and equality.  I look forward to working with her in this new capacity.  I also want to thank former Attorney General Eric Holder for his dedicated service to our country through many difficult challenges.	1107229032636940
288586617834523	I'll be hosting my annual Grants Open House this Wednesday, April 15th, at 1pm at my Renton District Office.

288586617834523	Last weekend, my staff- along with the help of several judges– announced the winners of the 2015 Congressional Art Competition for Washington's 9th Congressional District at the Wing Luke Museum in Seattle. First place winner Yoon Jung (Esther) Choi, from Bellevue High School, will travel to Washington, D.C. this June to attend a reception at the Capitol Visitors Center (CVC), and have her artwork– entitled Inheritance– put on display in the U.S. Capitol. Congratulations, Esther, and thank you to all of this year’s judges and participants.	1096799853679858
288586617834523	Today marks the 88th birthday of Cesar Chavez who was a leader of the United Farm Workers of America and organized thousands of migrant farm workers to fight for their civil rights.  He was a tireless advocate for equality and justice.  I am an original cosponsor of a resolution in the House of Representatives to honor the accomplishments and legacy of Mr. Chavez. #CesarChavezDay	1092872974072546
288586617834523	I wish Tomoko Dodo all the best as she is leaving her position as Senior Consul for the Consulate General of Japan in Seattle.  Over the last four years, Ms. Dodo was very engaged with the Japanese community in the 9th District.  She and her office were tireless advocates for Nisei Vets, strong promoters of cultural and linguistic exchange at the annual Japan Exchange & Teaching (JET) program, and sponsors of the annual Aki Matsuri Festival, which was held in Bellevue last year. Ms. Dodo was a pleasure to work with and she will be missed greatly in our community.	1092157580810752

288586617834523	House Republicans are yet again manufacturing a crisis to force their extreme agenda upon the American people. In December, Republicans funded DHS only through February with the intent to hold its funding hostage to jam through their extreme immigration policies.  This dangerous strategy has failed, and once again we’re at the brink of shutting down the agency that protects our national security and the livelihood of the men and women that protect us.  The Senate recognizes the importance of DHS and has come together in a bipartisan way to pass a clean funding bill.  I urge House Republican leadership to do the same. #DontShutdownOurSecurity	1070022766357567

288586617834523	I am pleased that the ILWU and PMA came together to reach an agreement. I look forward to learning more about the details when they become available. Our economy, workers, and businesses rely on our West Coast ports so I am glad that they will resume full operations.	1066336676726176
288586617834523	I am disappointed in the decision to temporarily delay the President’s executive action.  The President acted within his legal authority to help fix our broken immigration system as President Bush, Reagan, and many Presidents have before.  The President’s action is much needed as it would bring millions of families and children who live in constant fear of deportation out of the shadows and refocus our resources on individuals who present real risks to our communities.  Delaying this critical action continues to ignore the glaring need for immigration reform and will continue to rip families and communities across the country apart.	1064529266906917
288586617834523	Our economy and our nation are the strongest when all Americans share in economic success, and Congress must focus on legislation that invests in hard-working families and our middle class.  Instead, Republicans are voting today for the 56th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  We need to do better.   #PeopleOverPolitics	1055123481180829
288586617834523	International Holocaust Remembrance Day is dedicated to the memory of those who suffered under Nazi Persecution, and the millions of victims that perished throughout the Holocaust. As we honor and remember those that were tragically lost, we are reminded of our commitment to combat rising anti-Semitism and to condemn bigotry and hatred everywhere. Today, I join my constituents in the 9th District and across the country in remembering and vowing to never forget the victims of the Holocaust. #HolocaustRemembranceDay	1050665961626581
288586617834523	There was no fiercer advocate for equality than Martin Luther King Jr.  Despite daunting challenges, he never stopped fighting and his legacy continues to inspire millions of Americans today.  As we honor the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we must recognize that his dream to provide equality and opportunity to every American still has not been reached.  Zip codes and incomes too often dictate one’s ability to access high-quality education, affordable healthcare, and good-paying employment opportunities, and the right to vote continues to be threatened for many Americans .  To truly honor Dr. King’s dream, our country must come together and recommit ourselves to continue the fight for equality by reducing income inequality and expanding economic opportunities for all. #MLKDay	1045922732100904

288586617834523	The Jones Act is an important law that promotes a robust domestic maritime industry that helps to ensure our national security, while also providing for 500,000 U.S. jobs and producing over $100 billion dollars in economic output.  Any attempt to repeal or weaken this law would be harmful to our national security and our economy. #JonesAct	1044220532271124
547907568553615	Trade is a vital part of Washington’s economy. There is no doubt about that. Trade does not, however, exist in a vacuum, and for any agreement to be successful, we need to think bigger picture. Investing in our infrastructure, implementing comprehensive immigration reform, and reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank are some of the priorities that are being ignored during this debate. If we want to build an economy ready to compete with the rest of the world, we need to broaden this trade effort to include a commitment to actions that will bolster our economy back home. \n\nAccordingly, and after a great amount of input from constituents in the 10th District, I will vote no on trade promotion authority, known as fast track. I am open to trade legislation that enhances our ability to better compete in a global economy, but this approach is piecemeal and does not do enough to advance the interests and potential of the hard-working Americans I represent. We can do better.	1004305469580487
547907568553615	Over Memorial Day weekend, I visited Clover Park High School in Lakewood to visit the 9th annual "Arlington Project". Under the leadership of faculty members David Russell and Bryan Winkler, the project recreates the Arlington National Cemetery on the school's front lawn each year the week leading up to Memorial Day. More than 6,800 individually named markers serve as reminders of our fallen servicemembers, killed in overseas conflicts since 2001. Thank you to Clover Park High School for taking the time to honor the memory of every single sacrifice, and giving the community the opportunity to see the project.	997603076917393

547907568553615	One year ago today, tea party members in the House Majority issued an irresponsible ultimatum, causing the government to shut down. As a result of the shutdown, our economy lost $24 billion and GDP to fell to 2.4 percent. In the South Sound, thousands of federal employees at JBLM were furloughed and small businesses lost revenue. \n \nI was strongly opposed to the government shutdown and supported passing a clean funding bill, because all Americans deserve representatives that honor the legislative process and work together. \n \nWhat legislation do you think both parties should work together on to pass when we are back in session? Please let me know in the comments.	871603629517339

130377260362609	McKinley: The Budget Process Needs to Be Fixed\n\nWashington, D.C. —Rep. David B. McKinley, P.E.  (R-WV) issued the following statement regarding the government funding bill that passed the House today:\n\n“When the Republican House majority came to Washington four years ago we sought to increase transparency, implement a more open process, and end the closed door practices that marked the Nancy Pelosi era. Yet this week we were presented with a 1,600 page spending bill with 48 hours to review it before funding runs out. We were given no opportunities to change the bill.\n\n“While I appreciate the work of the House Appropriations committee and recognize there are many good provisions included in this bill, it did not include protections for West Virginia’s coal miners, so I voted against the bill and the broken process that produced it.\n\n“Next year, with new leadership in the Senate hopefully we can break the cycle of last minute deals formulated behind closed doors. Congress needs to return to an open process that allows members to provide input and make changes. With willing partners in the Senate we will be able to reduce spending and change damaging policies on everything from the EPA to health care to immigration.\n\n“With this latest hurdle behind us I hope we can focus on working together in an open manner to address the challenges our country faces.”	779725088761153
130377260362609	Wishing You and Your Family a Happy Thanksgiving\n\nEach year, on the fourth Thursday in November, Americans gather around the table to celebrate Thanksgiving. We take this time to reflect on the many things for which we are grateful: our family and friends; our co-workers; our jobs; our health and the freedoms we enjoy in America. Too often, we get caught up in the pace of everyday life and don’t take the time to appreciate just how fortunate we are. This is a time for such reflection.\n\nAs Americans, we have to cherish this special time of thanksgiving and togetherness. We also can give thanks and remember those who have sacrificed for our freedoms.West Virginia is home to a significant number of men and women who have served in our Armed Forces and sacrificed so much so that we may enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness here at home. Let us give thanks to these men and women, and give thanks for our great country.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!	772128826187446
130377260362609	McKinley Responds to Obama’s newest Politically Driven Regulation\n\nWashington, D.C. — Today, Congressman David McKinley responded to the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed changes to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone, which would have devastating consequences to America’s economy. \n\n“While many of us are travelling or with our families enjoying Thanksgiving celebrating another year together and giving thanks, this President broke another promise to America. The American people said that the key problem is our economy. Businesses operate by staying focused on the matter at hand to solve key problems. However, the President’s recent climate deal with China, his immigration plan and now his ozone proposal, he seems to be ignoring, once again, our economy.\n\n“In fact, before his re-election in 2011, President Obama admitted that a new Ozone Regulation would be a detriment to the American economy and cost millions of jobs and directed the EPA to withdraw the proposed regulation. What has changed so drastically in 3 years when studies have been published to suggest that many of our cities have already reduced ground-level ozone by as much as 60 percent?\n\n“This newest proposal is merely a continuation of his destruction on our domestic energy and manufacturing production. In fact, studies show that the lowering of this standard is going to cost Americans as much as $3.4 trillion, 20 percent of our total economy, making this one of the most expensive and job destroying regulations ever issued.\n\n“West Virginians have already taken a devastating hit from this President and his War on Coal. Essentially, this regulation will take another $1,500 every year out of each West Virginian’s pocketbook. Even the local dry cleaner and gas station will be affected.\n\n“The key item people need to realize is that the EPA is not required to reduce the standard, but merely required to review it. Given the fact that most of our nation is still in the early stages of implementing the 2008 standard and ground-level ozone is dropping, it’s time the President remembers his words from 2011 and retain the current standard. \n\n“This election was a referendum on the President and his poor policies.  This proposed rule is a perfect example of that.  With our national debt over $17 trillion and this country in a severe deficit, one would think that now is not the time to issue another regulation that would further harm the American economy.”\n\nOn November 13, 2014, Congressman McKinley and his Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues wrote a letter to the EPA urging the agency to provide for full accounting costs of this regulation.	772086739524988

130377260362609	Rep. McKinley Applauds CMS Decision to Allow Access to Hearing Devices\n\nWashington, D.C. —Rep. David B. McKinley, P.E. (R-W.Va.) applauded the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) decision to drop a proposed rule that would have eliminated longstanding Medicare coverage for several types of hearing devices. The reversal by CMS will help ensure hearing impaired people continue to have access to the best care possible.\n\n“As someone with a hearing impairment and an advocate for people who face similar challenges, I was pleased to learn on Friday that CMS saw the error in their proposed rule,” said McKinley.  “This is an issue that is personal to me as a hearing impaired American with a cochlear implant and a grandfather of a child with an osseointegrated hearing devise.”\n\nThe CMS rule would have eliminated longstanding Medicare coverage for osseointegrated “prosthetic” implants such as the Cochlear Baha® System.  More than 360 million people live with disabling hearing loss.  For some of these patients, a surgically prescribed and implanted solution is the only effective treatment. \n\n“This decision means millions of Americans with severe hearing loss will have access to this life-changing treatment,” continued McKinley.  “There are ways for CMS to evaluate new technologies and find cost savings without leaving patients without an effective solution to treat their hearing loss.”\n\nMcKinley actively fought the proposed rule and worked with advocates for the hearing impaired to prod CMS to reverse its decision.\n\nIn August, Rep. McKinley returned to Washington to meet with officials from CMS to discuss the importance of the system for patients.  He also joined several of his colleagues in the House to send letters to CMS urging them to reverse the proposed rule.	760546857345643

We are also a center for groundbreaking research on natural gas and coal being done at West Virginia University and the National Energy Technology Laboratory,” stated McKinley.  “By committing nearly $7.5 million over the next five years, the Department of Energy clearly recognizes that West Virginia is a leader in this field. This investment will allow us to produce energy more efficiently and safely in the years to come and is an exciting development for WVU and our state.”	758119327588396

130377260362609	Rep. McKinley Introduces Bill to Help Hospitals Communicate\nStudy Will Examine Compatibility of Electronic Health Records Systems\n          \nWashington, D.C. — After listening to concerns from health care providers and hospital executives, Rep. David B. McKinley, P.E. (R-W.Va.) recently introduced a bill (H.R. 5537) to help hospitals communicate with each other, which would increase efficiency and improve quality of care. \n\nThe bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the communication between computer systems used by hospitals to store and access electronic health records.\n\n“Over the past three and a half years we have met with hospitals, health care workers, patients and families and a common theme is the fact that medical records are not easily transferable between different hospital systems,” said McKinley.  “With all the technology available to us in 2014, this should be a problem that can be solved.”\n\n“Designing medical records systems that can talk to each other will increase access to care, lower health care costs, and allow for more effective coordination,” said McKinley. \n\n“We live in an interconnected world where banking systems and other services are able to connect around the globe,” said McKinley. “Ensuring our health care system does the same is just common sense.” \n\nMcKinley’s bill calls for GAO to report to Congress and make recommendations on how to increase interoperability of hospital computer systems to store and access electronic health records.	752986571435005
130377260362609	Rep. McKinley Calls for Ebola Travel Ban \nMcKinley Urges More Aggressive Response to Public Health Threat\n          \nWashington, D.C. — In response to the recent spread of the Ebola virus from West Africa to the United States, Rep. David B. McKinley, P.E. (R-W.Va.) is urging the Obama Administration and public health officials to take a more aggressive response, including restricting travel from West African countries where there have been significant outbreaks.\n\n“Combating the spread of Ebola requires an aggressive and coordinated plan,” said McKinley. “Unfortunately the response thus far has been full of missteps and confusion and the American public is losing confidence.”\n\n“Stopping the outbreak in West Africa is the only way to contain the virus – and the U.S. needs to continue to provide leadership on that front – but there are several common sense steps we need to take to protect the American people,” added McKinley. “Temporarily banning travel from the West African countries hit hardest by Ebola until this gets under control should be one step.”\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans support limiting travel, but yesterday President Obama said he opposes a travel ban.\n\n“A travel ban won’t solve the Ebola crisis, but it should be part of a broader strategy, including resources to fight the outbreak in Africa, enhanced screenings at airports, and more intensive training for health care workers,” said McKinley. “President Obama should rethink his opposition and use his authority to institute a travel ban.”\n\n“The United States has the best health care system in the world, despite the inadequate response thus far, I am confident we can lead the fight to defeat Ebola with a more aggressive plan,” said McKinley.\n\nYesterday the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce held a hearing with leadership from the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health. The hearing was just the latest action taken by the House to address the threat to public health.\n\nTimeline\n\nSeptember 12:  The House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell seeking more information regarding the Ebola outbreak and preparedness efforts.\n\nSeptember 17:  The full House passes a continuing resolution that included money to fight the Ebola outbreak.\n\nSeptember 17: The Foreign Affairs Committee held a subcommittee hearing with testimony from Obama Administration officials to examine global efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak.\n\nSeptember 25: The House Armed Services and Appropriations committees announced the release of $50 million to support Operation United Assistance, the Department of Defense-led mission to combat the Ebola outbreak.\n\nOctober 9: The House Armed Services and Appropriations committees announced the release of an additional $700 million to support Operation United Assistance.\n\nOctober 16: The Foreign Affairs, Homeland Security, and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees sent a letter to the State Department calling for the immediate suspension of the issuance of visas for non-U.S. nationals in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. \n\nOctober 16:  The Energy and Commerce Committee held a subcommittee hearing examining the U.S. public health response to the Ebola outbreak, with testimony from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other administration officials.	751643438235985

130377260362609	McKinley Meets with Business Leaders in Northern Panhandle to Discuss Job Creation\nMcKinley Hosts Roundtable to Discuss How to Revitalize Manufacturing in the Region \n          \nWashington, D.C. — This morning in Weirton, Rep. David B. McKinley, P.E. (R-W.V.) joined with local business leaders to discuss the future of manufacturing in the Ohio River Valley.\n\n“Driving up and down the Ohio River you see just how hard our area has been hit by the decline of steel and manufacturing,” said McKinley. “The loss of jobs due to unfair foreign competition, excessive regulations, and other factors has hurt communities like Weirton, Follansbee, and Newell.”\n\n“We have a responsibility to protect the jobs we already have and find areas where manufacturers can grow and create jobs,” added McKinley.\n\nThe roundtable meeting included representatives from local businesses including Coil Slitting International, Ergon, ArcelorMittal, and Wheeling Nisshin, as well as leaders from the Weirton Area Chamber of Commerce and the Brooke-Hancock Business Development Corporation.\n\nThe discussion covered a wide range of topics including workforce development, infrastructure, burdensome regulations, health care, and taxes.\n\n“It’s important to listen to the challenges these businesses are facing and find ways to help them,” said McKinley. “We don’t have all the answers in Washington. We are able to take ideas from meetings like this one and take action.”\n\n“With low cost energy, an ideal geographic location, and a skilled workforce, West Virginia can once again be a center of manufacturing and create good-paying jobs,” said McKinley. “I look forward to working \ntogether with business leaders to make this happen.”\n\nMcKinley has introduced and sponsored several bills and amendments to help revitalize manufacturing including:\n\n• The “Manufacturing Economic Recovery Act” (H.R. 1522), which would provide a tax credit for companies that acquire, invest, and create jobs in empty manufacturing facilities.\n• The “American Manufacturing and Worker Protection Act” (H.R. 4322), which provides money to companies and employees who lost jobs and wages due to unfair foreign competition.\n• The “Economic Recovery On-the-Job Training Act” (H.R. 3524) which would direct money for job training in economically disadvantaged areas.\n• An amendment to the Fiscal Year 2015 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill to help small companies fight unfair trade at the International Trade Commission; and\n• The “Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act” (H.R. 2996) which was sponsored by McKinley and passed the House in September. This bill would create regional manufacturing hubs where manufacturers, colleges and universities can partner to ensure workers have necessary skills and create a center for research and development. \nMcKinley is also a member of the House Manufacturing Caucus.	746257082107954

It was also an absolute honor to have the Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr. join us this morning. We have seen constant attempts by some states to erode voting rights and make it harder for citizens to vote. This amendment would affirm the principle of equal participation in our democracy for every citizen.	782219848524424

89152017954	This week marks the 2015 National Court Reporting and Captioning Week. Our court reporters play a critical role in our communities – they are the guardians of the public record and have the unique skill of translating the spoken word into text to record history, preserve judicial proceedings, and assist individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing. I’m also excited that our Wisconsin Court Reporters have partnered with the Library of Congress to record oral histories from our brave men and women in uniform as part of the Veterans History Project.	10152823702822955

89152017954	The French government recently asked me to present, on its behalf, the Knight of the Legion of Honor medal to Mr. Doug Ward in Mondovi.\n\nThe award is a tribute to the sacrifices made for France and western Europe during World War II, and is France’s highest honor for those who have “achieved remarkable deeds" for that country.

I hope that you will be able to spend time with your family and friends, whether they are across the street or across the country.\n\nAs we gather around our tables, we must remember that there are many who are struggling, not just today, but everyday. As you read this, some of our staff members are out in their communities, supporting their local charities and food banks. I encourage you to join them and make an investment in your own community by helping those in need. Enjoy this celebration, be safe, and God bless.	10153434009754546

58864029545	The grief and frustration of the American people is justified and understandable, especially as we struggle to address the highly polarized relationship between law enforcement and young black men. The unnecessary loss of Michael Brown's young life should urge all Americans to recommit to reconciliation during this dark time. As we reflect on the grand jury’s decision, let us move toward honoring the dignity and value of Michael's life. The Brown family continues to be in my thoughts and prayers.	10153426560689546

58864029545	Unfortunately, this is an all too familiar story in our country. Yet again, we find ourselves grieving the loss of another young life cut short. The untimely death of Michael Brown and the civil unrest that followed in Ferguson, Missouri, has touched countless lives. As local and federal authorities continue to investigate these tragic events, we must do everything in our power to peacefully channel our anger and frustration in a manner that honors Michael’s memory and strengthens our resolve. I pray that the concern and sympathy of our nation will help the Brown family through this difficult time. I have faith that Michael Brown’s life will have a lasting impact on this world and inspire hope that tomorrow will be a more compassionate and understanding place to call our own.	10153144858484546

58864029545	I remember sitting in class when I was first told that our President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated. At 12 years old, I was so traumatized.

119657691436457	President Obama’s comments at the #NationalPrayerBreakfast yesterday were a distortion of history and an unfortunate exercise in moral equivalency. The crusades happened 700 years ago; as Governor Jindal so aptly put it, "Mr. President, the Medieval Christian threat is under control.  Please deal with the radical Islamic threat today."        \n\nI will continue to push this Administration to put forward a comprehensive and long overdue strategy for defeating these barbarians.	751335898268630

157169920997203	Five years after the American people were promised a new and better path forward in healthcare, tens of millions of people remain uninsured, millions have lost the insurance they liked, insurance premiums have increased, and more Americans oppose the law than support it. \n\nThe healthcare law has been one long series of broken promises.\n\nThe Administration’s misleading claims that the ACA would allow people to keep doctors and coverage that they liked have hurt people’s faith in their government and made it clear that we can and must do better.	805746079472914

174519582574426	Today is June 22nd. That means the deadline for parties negotiating an Iran nuclear deal is eight days away. This group in Switzerland seems to be racing to broker a deal, and I believe Americans should be concerned. \n\nSecretary Kerry and his negotiators have already conceded so much that I’m not confident a good deal is even possible at this point. Let’s not forget how high the stakes are here. If we agree to a bad deal, we aren’t just talking about a nuclear Iran, we’re talking about setting in motion a chain of events that could lead to multiple countries in this very volatile region wanting to become nuclear as well.\n\nAs you know, a few months ago I traveled to the Middle East and visited the countries that would be directly dealing with a nuclear Iran: Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia. These are our allies and they are VERY concerned that what is being brokered isn’t good at all.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker has raised his concerns about the plans. I agree with Senator Corker that walking away from a bad deal is the better option at this point. In any case, I’m glad Congress will have the final say over whether or not to lift sanctions on Iran. \n\nWe can’t allow President Obama and Secretary Kerry’s desire for a “legacy” for themselves to trump what’s in the best interests of the United States and our allies. http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/22/congress-sharpens-its-knives-ahead-of-iran-deal	1129835510376157

174519582574426	I had the opportunity to spend some time with national and local Army leadership this week and discuss various issues that they face. I visited with General Ray Odierno, Chief of Staff of the Army, at the House Army Caucus breakfast and met with Major General Mike Lundy of Fort Rucker while he and his team were in D.C. It’s an honor to work with these leaders to make sure our Army’s priorities are met.\n \nLast week, we were able to defeat an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill that would have cost Army Aviation and negatively affected our units that are deploying overseas. I’ve been opposed to sequestration since the start, and have worked to mitigate its impact on the Army. Army Aviation is a critical battlefield capability in the war on terror. I believe it is unfair to tie their hands even further given the squeeze they are already in under sequestration.\n \nIf we had delayed the helicopter transfers, we would have created a domino effect that would result in the U.S. sending our soldiers or Afghanistan and Iraq who are neither fully trained nor fully equipped.\n \nUnfortunately, Senate Democrats have decided to put politics above our troops and national security, and this week blocked the spending bill. This is an issue that we should all agree on, and I hope the Administration will change course.	1127874930572215

209486545087	In another attempt to scale back ObamaCare, I voted YES on H.R. 1190, the Protecting Seniors’ Access to Medicare Act, which repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). This board, created by the passage of ObamaCare, would have the authority to singlehandedly cut Medicare spending, devastating seniors pocketbooks and healthcare choices if and when those unilateral decisions were made. Health care decisions should be made between patients and their doctors, and never by a board comprised of unelected individuals. I am pleased to say that this bill passed the House and is on its way to the Senate.	10155766206340088
209486545087	Today, I voted YES on H.R. 160 - the Protect Medical Innovation Act, which repeals the Medical Device Tax. This bill overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives.

143344975723788	As we've seen over and over, Obamacare harms the very people we were told it would help. The 2.3% tax on the manufacturer, producer, or importer of medical devices is one of the most harmful portions of the President's signature law. The tax not only raises costs for patients, but it also hinders lifesaving innovation. Both consequences are unacceptable. For that reason, earlier today I joined my colleagues in passing H.R. 160, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, which would repeal that tax.	906380402753571

7109195747	Had an excellent time at the Napa Valley Horsemen’s Association Mustang Day. This is a special community event where families and children can come see some beautiful horses, learn a little history and have a lot of fun. Many thanks to the Napa Valley Horsemen’s Association – the oldest running horse club in California – for all of their work. This Mustang Day is unique for two reasons. First, this is the first time that the Mustangs themselves were available for adoption. And second, the training the Mustangs have received is one-of-a-kind. Through a partnership between the Bureau of Land Management and the Sacramento County Sherriff’s office, inmates at Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center take wild horses and provide them with initial training. Through this training they make the animals easier to handle for adopters. Not only does this program provide inmates with job skills that translate to the outside world, it helps make sure horses are adoptable, can find good homes, and have good lives.	10153007028050748
282703023118	Last week, the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors approved the county budget, which includes a serious investment in mental health care services for those in need. It was a smart and forward thinking decision by the Board of Supervisors, led by Chairman Phil Serna and supported by the entire Board and many in our community. I firmly believe that all levels of government must work together to ensure those suffering from mental illness can find the care they need, especially in their time of crisis.	10153355100663119

464458413604093	Today, President Obama asked Congress for the authority to wage war on #ISIS and its affiliated terror groups. As a retired combat Marine, I know the decision to authorize our troops to go into combat is the most serious decision that Congress can face. As a member of the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees, I’ll be evaluating this request in the coming weeks. ISIS is a threat to the Middle East, a threat to our allies, and a threat to the #American people. Any authorization must come with a strategy for victory. I call on the administration to articulate this strategy in the coming weeks and remain engaged with Congress so we can defeat ISIS and eliminate the threat they pose to our citizens and our homeland.	811464945570103

99332606976	I cannot condemn in strong enough terms the heinous killing of eight worshippers and a pastor at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. The victims and their families are in my prayers. We must stand together in this time of tragedy and affirm that such acts have no place in our country; that we will never be broken or cowed in the face of violence and hatred. \n\nOn the contrary, we must be more determined than ever to heal the families torn by this attack and achieve justice for its victims. Throughout its history, Emanuel A.M.E. Church has been a place of refuge and strength for those standing against the worst trials of slavery, segregation, and opposition to the Civil Rights Movement. May its members persevere, and again show us how hope, solidarity, and humanity overcome evil.\n\n#CharlestonShooting	10153142295171977

15675385380	Today, I sent a letter along with Congressman Raul M. Grijalva to Secretary Jeh Johnson at the Department of Homeland Security urging action to prevent LGBT detainees from sexual assault. The alarming rates of sexual assaults of non-heterosexual detainees should be a wakeup call for Immigration And Customs Enforcement (ICE). Even more dire is the fact ICE continues to detain transgender women in men’s detention facilities. ICE has the power to determine suitable alternatives to detain LGBT persons, but instead they continue to ignore safer alternatives. Our letter calls on ICE to use the power they have to create a safer and more humane alternative that will treat LGBT individuals with respect and dignity.	10155782307405381

The funding bill approved by the House today once again provides significant funding for the infrastructure our veterans and active duty military members need and deserve.

If we fail to act, these threats will grow and the risk to our country will be far greater. President Obama’s budget plan leads to more spending, more debt, and more kicking the can down the road.  That’s not leadership. Thankfully, House Republicans have chosen to once again pursue a responsible path that leads to a truly balanced budget.

70063393423	Iran cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, and the United States should not be party to any agreement that allows them to move closer to that reality – now or in the future.  Today, I was proud to stand and support Prime Minister Netanyahu.  I have and I will continue to stand with Israel.\n\nI strongly agree with Prime Minister Netanyahu’s assessment that Iran continues to conduct itself in a manner that is directly in line with a distorted, violent spectrum of Islam and is the primary state sponsor of terrorism in the world.	10152743466273424
70063393423	By opposing the construction of the Keystone pipeline the President has demonstrated how out of touch he is with middle-class American families. Let’s be clear, today President Obama took a position that makes it harder to achieve North American energy independence, kills American jobs, fails to reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East, and insults one of our closest allies and trading partners. I look forward to voting to override the President’s horribly misguided veto.	10152730030713424
70063393423	I had the privilege today of attending the unveiling of the nose art on the Spirit of Ronald Reagan C-17 aircraft at March Air Reserve Base.

70063393423	The completion of the Murrieta Creek flood control project is long overdue and I expect the Corps of Engineers to do everything in their power to work with the Riverside County Flood Control District to finish it. Today, I urged the top leadership at the Corps of Engineers to make the project a priority and to ensure the necessary steps are taken without any avoidable delays. The residents in Murrieta and Temecula deserve the piece-of-mind that comes with adequate flood protection. Click here to read more and watch the video: http://goo.gl/uujzYa	10152704278338424
70063393423	What we’ve heard from the President is a call for higher taxes and more spending – that approach to governing is exactly what the American people rejected in our recent election. The best way to help lower and middle class families is to put the policies in place that will foster an economy that is full of good, well-paying jobs.\n\nWe need a simpler, flatter tax system in our country. Not only will it make our businesses more competitive globally, but it will allow all taxpayers to spend less time and money when it is time to pay taxes.\n\nInstead of fixating on new and expensive programs, the President should focus on modest policy changes that get the government out of the way of progress. The REBUILD Act, which I introduced earlier this month, is a great example of a policy change that removes duplicative government requirements and results in the construction of infrastructure projects at a lower cost and faster timeline. Those are tangible results at no cost to taxpayers.	10152664119183424
70063393423	Commuter Alert - The Main Street Squeeze in Corona begins Tuesday! 91 Freeway eastbound on-ramp at Main St. in Corona will be CLOSED for fifteen months. Also, Main St. will be narrowed to 2 lanes in each direction under the freeway. This will allow new bridges to be built and Main St. to be lowered and widened to accommodate the 91 Freeway expansion. Plan accordingly and don't forget our local businesses near the freeway. PLEASE SHARE! More info here: http://www.sr91project.info/media/upload/v1xpyu1d5y.pdf	10152656057058424
70063393423	Tomorrow, the House will vote on amendments that will prevent the Department of Homeland Security from acting on President Obama’s unconstitutional executive amnesty plan.

70063393423	Today, I voted along with a bipartisan majority of the House (266 to 153) to approve H.R. 3, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. The legislation would immediately authorize the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. My constituents are sick and tired of the delays in approving and building the Keystone pipeline. The recent drop in gas prices highlights the economic benefits of increased energy production right here in North America. Building the Keystone pipeline will increase access to more North American energy sources and further reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East. President Obama’s opposition to the Keystone pipeline and all of its economic benefits shows just how out of touch he is with middle class working families.	10152643718408424

70063393423	While we rejoice in the release of American aid worker Alan Gross and an unnamed U.S. intelligence asset, we cannot forget that Cuba is still under the oppressive thumb of the Castro regime.  I continue to be wary of President Obama’s disturbing trend of placing trust in dictators with a long history of abusing the rights and restricting the freedom of their citizens.  The day to truly celebrate will be the day the Cuban people are free from the tyrannical rule of the Castros and they are able to freely elect their nation’s leaders.	10152571435233424
70063393423	California’s economy is directly linked with a reliable and affordable water supply. The bill passed by the House today will take immediate steps to improve the dire drought conditions and provide Californians some short-term certainty that we will be able to utilize whatever rainfall occurs this winter, as opposed to pumping it out into the ocean.  I know that many of my constituents continue to be frustrated by the regulatory restrictions that have exacerbated the impact of our ongoing drought. Instead of offering solutions to help California families, farmers, and communities, extreme environmental special interest groups and President Obama have voiced their opposition to the bill passed by the House. My constituents need solutions to our water crisis and have grown tired of the usual ‘just say no’ attitude that will only jeopardize California’s economy.

70063393423	Like many Americans, I strongly oppose President Obama’s decision to proceed with an unprecedented and unconstitutional executive action adjusting the status of millions of illegal immigrants.  Our nation’s founders carefully placed the power to create and modify laws with Congress and left the President with the power to execute them. \n\nToday, President Obama is unquestionably setting a dangerous precedent by attempting to rewrite our immigration laws without Congressional action.  Regardless of your views on what reforms are necessary to our immigration laws, Americans should be extremely wary of granting any President the power to change laws affecting millions of people single-handedly.  The next President will be able to undo President Obama’s executive action with the stroke of a pen on their first day in office. \n\nI completely agree with the comments made by George Washington University Law School Professor Jonathan Turley, who describes himself as a liberal, that "what the President is suggesting is tearing at the very fabric of the Constitution.”\n\nMy constituents want to see increased border security and the mandatory use of E-Verify at the heart of any action to reform our immigration laws.  It is very telling that the President is willing to reach beyond his Constitutional authority on nearly every issue but not act where there is bipartisan support – increasing border security and an expansion of E-Verify.  Despite the President’s actions, I will continue to work with my colleagues in the House to advance efforts that will strengthen our border security and make the use of E-Verify mandatory.	10152521772848424
70063393423	Today, we honor all Americans who proudly served our nation in the finest military force the world has ever known.   While we can never repay them for their sacrifices, we pledge to fulfill our commitments to our veterans and ensure that they receive the benefits they are rightfully entitled to.  Our country’s veterans deserve our thanks and praise today on Veterans’ Day – and every day.	10152505214678424
70063393423	On the eve of September 11th, we are reminded that we cannot ignore or discount the actions of our enemies in distant lands. The President, after failing to secure a Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq and consistently ignoring the growing problem of ISIS for the past several years, now turns to the American people and Congress for support of limited military operations to combat ISIS. There is no doubt that ISIS poses significant national security concerns for the U.S. and the world. We must work with our allies to attack ISIS through air strikes, and ultimately destroy their ability to plan and carry out attacks. The President’s holiday from history has come to an end and now he must show both courage and leadership as our Commander-in-Chief.	10152381063733424
70063393423	Today, I voted along with a bipartisan majority of my House colleagues (420 - 5) in support of H.R. 3230, the Veterans’ Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act. Our veterans deserve nothing less than timely, high quality health care and the bill approved by the House today will help achieve that goal. There is simply no excuse for the delays and incidents of poor treatment of our veterans in VA medical centers. We need to provide a consistent, world class health care treatment and benefits for all veterans across the country. The bipartisan nature of the bill passed today signals the unwavering support our veterans have in Congress. This bill provides important health care options, outside the VA, while also investing to improve our current VA system.  You can read more about the bill here: http://goo.gl/k3On9W	10152296795553424
70063393423	Today, I voted in support of H.R. 4315, the Endangered Species Transparency and Reasonableness Act. H.R. 4315 improves Endangered Species Act (ESA) transparency, enhances the role of states, and discourages harmful, frivolous litigation. Riverside County continues to suffer economic harm because of the unintended consequences of the ESA and regular lawsuits by environmental extremists. When the ESA was first approved the goal was to protect species, not to line the pockets of radical special interest groups and their lawyers. Legislation, like H.R. 4315, that restores some common sense to the application of our ESA law is long overdue. Protecting our environment and growing our economy are not mutually exclusive goals.

70063393423	Earlier today, the House Appropriations Committee approved my bill that will put the brakes on the EPA’s regulatory approach that is intent on expanding the federal government’s reach and harming our economy.

70063393423	Today, I introduced legislation, H.R. 5079, that would close an immigration loophole that is contributing to the crisis along the border in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. The legislation would amend a 2008 law that unintentionally created a loophole for unaccompanied children from Central America that are detained illegally crossing the border.  Solving our immigration crisis requires getting at the root of the problem, and if we fail to take steps like closing this loophole the significant challenges we are experiencing now will only continue and grow. \n\nThe long and dangerous journey from Central America to the Texas border, especially one aided by a smuggler, is something that no one, especially an unaccompanied child, should endure. The humane and responsible step for these children and for our immigration policy is to close this loophole and the incentive it provides. Americans expect the federal government to respond and quickly address the crisis at the border, which is why both Republicans and Democrats have voiced support for taking this step.\n\nClick here to read more about my bill: 1.usa.gov/1zuaf18	10152262013178424
70063393423	While I welcome the President’s request for additional resources in response to the growing crisis at our border, I strongly believe that it will take more than funding to ultimately solve the problem.  In addition to providing more funding for detention facilities in Texas and immigration judges, the President must end his catch-and-release policies to send a strong signal that anyone illegally crossing our border will not be able to remain in our country.  \n\nAs a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am eager to work with my colleagues to address the challenges presented by the ongoing crisis.  It is vital that the supplemental address the challenges faced by local communities, such as Murrieta, impacted by the crisis.  It is clear that the short-term costs to put the brakes on the crisis at the border are far cheaper than the long-term costs of an open borders policy.\n\nThe crisis should not have come to this point, President Obama had the resources and much of the authority to deal with the influx as it began but rather than implementing a decisive plan and putting a stop to the dangerous crossings, the President now must come to Congress asking for more authority and more money.  His failure of leadership is endangering children, taxing our border patrol agents, and now costing the American taxpayer money.	10152257103593424
70063393423	Happy Fourth of July!\n\n"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."	10152248889698424
70063393423	I am and continue to be opposed to the Obama administration’s decision to transport illegal immigrants detained in Texas to the Murrieta Border Patrol Station, however if they insist on taking this action Riverside County residents expect them to put in place sufficient health and public safety procedures. Riverside County has offered to place its mobile health clinic at the Murrieta Station to assist with health screenings, treatment and immunizations. However, the Obama administration has failed to authorize this common sense action. If President Obama is going to spread the problems he has created at our border to communities around the country, the least he can do is allow those communities to protect everyone’s health and safety.	10152245543058424
117483585008	I join President Obama and my colleagues in Congress in mourning the senseless massacre of the nine members of the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina. As the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, Emanuel A.M.E has been a beacon of hope and inspiration for African Americans since the early 1800s. From the early days of slavery, to the height of the Civil Rights Movement, Emanuel A.M.E. has been a foundation for Charleston’s black community. That this unspeakable terror could occur within a sanctuary held in such high regard is chilling and all too familiar to many of us who lived at the peak of the Civil Rights movement.\n\nWhile we do not yet know the full details of the shooting, we do know that nine lives were stolen from us too soon. And in an instance, a community and nation is once again called to reflect on our history and how we can forge a better future in which the dignity of all people is respected – among them the liberty and lives of black men and women whether they are walking on the street or praying in church. If we are to lead the world against terror and radicalism, we must ensure that such violent conduct is not tolerated at home. I support the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for South Carolina for their decision to open a hate crime investigation into the shooting. \n\nIt is my sincere hope that the nation will unite in support of Charleston at this difficult time. May the families find peace in knowing that in their final resting place, their loved ones were at home in faith and peaceful worship.	10152864476400009
256471267712118	Today is the anniversary of the G.I. Bill which helped millions of American heroes go to college, buy a home, and start their own businesses. It is a shame, however, that the WWII Merchant Marine veterans who risked their lives in service to this nation were not eligible for these life-changing benefits. \n\nIt is time to right this wrong. I am fighting to pass my legislation, HR 563, to recognize the valor of these veterans (like the ones pictured below) and begin to repay the great debt we owe them.	1217921504900418
256471267712118	Today is #Juneteenth-- a day to celebrate freedom and the end of the centuries long injustice of slavery. But the violence and hate that we saw this week in Charleston remind us how far we as a nation still have to go.	1215455671813668

112179098816942	Whenever there is a tragedy like the one in Charleston this week, our media coverage becomes all-consuming.  And it should.  \n\nCollectively, we are horrified by the tragic loss of life.  Nine innocent people gunned down in a church is hard to comprehend, or at least it should be.  Unfortunately, mass shootings take place regularly in our country.  I have written about the desperate need to finally take meaningful action to stop gun violence, and I am so frustrated that we have not.  There are lots of steps that we can take, and, over the coming days, I'll talk about them, and some of my friends will agree while others will not.\n\nBut there is another debate raging around this tragedy that I think is important, and I wanted to chime in.  If you check into my Facebook page from time to time, you know how strongly I feel about fighting hatred generally, and the increase in anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic terrorists.  When the terrorist struck at the Kosher supermarket in Paris, he did so because he wanted to kill Jews, and it was important to be clear about that. \n\nWe have an obligation to call out hatred and the most violent manifestation of it - murderous acts committed by terrorists.  The shooter in Charleston went to that church and started firing not because he was confused and wandered in.  He is a racist.  He was looking to kill people because of the color of their skin.  And he is a domestic terrorist who killed with racial hatred.\n\nIf we are going to fight hatred against people because of their race or their religion, then we must acknowledge it for what it is.  A murderous racist kills blacks, and he wants other blacks to be fearful.  A murderous anti-Semite kills Jews, and he wants other Jews to be fearful.  That's what terrorists do.\n\nWe will have many conversations about providing better access to mental health care, an issue I care deeply about.  And someone can try to explain to me how a  Confederate flag flying outside the State Capitol instead of on top of it is a compromise rather than merely a different place for so many to look at and cringe.  And we'll discuss guns.\n\nNow, let's offer comfort to the people of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and the people of Charleston and the people of South Carolina.  And let's stand united against racial hatred and domestic terrorism.	978265212208322

I have spoken in many of these churches, and this makes my heart hurt. I feel like crying. \n\nHow many more shootings must we endure? How many more human beings must be murdered before we speak up and speak out, before we say we must put an end to gun violence. \n\nIt is not just one person pulling the trigger, it is what's in our environment, in our makeup, that drives someone to a point where they are willing to murder innocent people, of all places in the house of the Lord, studying the holy word, praying prayers of peace, love, and forgiveness.\n\nIf you cannot go to a church, or a mosque, or a temple, to study and pray, where can we turn as a nation and as a people?	10153310706298405
172573036140374	The list of flaws and bad policy found in Obamacare is long, and again the House has acted to abolish one of its most concerning provisions known as the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) by passing H.R. 1190, the “Protecting Seniors Access to Medicare Act.” As an unelected panel appointed by the President, IPAB would have the authority to decide which services will be covered under Medicare, and set the rate of compensation for doctors – shifting the health care decision-making process away from doctors and patients to a 15 member board with no accountability to the public. Please urge the Senate to take up this important legislation quickly.	985641461500190

392284484191405	On June 18, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard voted against allowing the Administration’s Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), also known as “fast-track.”  Republican leadership attached the fast-track measure to an unrelated bill that serves public safety workers. The legislation, H.R. 2146, allows firefighters and other public safety employees who have forced retirement requirements to take early withdrawals from a government pension without being penalized. Gabbard also voted against the fast-track legislation last week.\n \n“It is an affront to the American people that leaders in Congress have attached fast-track authority legislation to a wholly unrelated bill that serves our firefighters and public safety workers.  I strongly support the original version of H.R. 2146, which enables our nation’s firefighters and law enforcement officers to access their pension funds when they are mandated to retire before age 65. However, I voted against the measure today because this fast-track legislation takes away the opportunity for the American people’s voice to be heard in determining our future.  Instead, fast-track legislation places our future in the hands of multinational corporations and foreign governments. The American people are deeply concerned about how any potential trade deal will impact their jobs, livelihood, and our economy, and they deserve to have their voices heard through Congress in the trade negotiating process.”  -TG\n \nTrade Promotion Authority allows the Administration to negotiate trade deals behind closed doors, and then send the finished deal to Congress for an up or down vote, without allowing lawmakers to amend.  The House of Representatives passed fast-track authority by a vote of 218-208.  The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.	863771387042710

183180288372896	Hoosiers win with free trade.  Free trade creates greater market access by removing barriers to trade and allowing Hoosier workers to compete in a global market place.  Just yesterday, Chiyoda, a parts supplier for Subaru of America, Inc., announced their intention to expand and add 300 jobs in their Greencastle factory.  They currently have 230 workers at the factory.  The expansion will boost the manufacturing capacity for Subaru’s assembly factory in Lafayette, Indiana.\n\nWhat hurts Hoosier jobs is unfair trade - not free trade.  As Thomas Gibson, the President of the American Iron and Steel Institute said “the American steel industry is under attack from a surge of unfairly traded imports across a wide range of products from a variety of countries, many that continue to disrupt world markets by subsidizing the production of steel products and dumping those steel products in the U.S. market.”  I recognize this.  I have supported legislation like the American Trade Enforcement Effective Act to improve the effectiveness of our trade laws and sent letters to House leadership on the importance of trade enforcement.\n\nTo read a letter that Mr. Gibson wrote to IndyStar on the subject, please visit - http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/05/31/let-trade-cheaters-hook/28271007/  \n\nI will continue to support efforts to help Hoosiers reach new and untapped markets.	1044486562242260

183180288372896	Thank you all for your comments and questions on the trade legislation being considered in the House today.  While I have covered most points already, I want to specifically respond to a common question best articulated by Tahni Hutchins who asked “Why does a trade agreement need to be secret?”\n\nThis is a great question with a pretty simple answer.  These agreements are not “secret.”  Rather, they require confidentiality to ensure the U.S. can get the best deal possible, without other countries, which are completely against us, finding out about what's going on in the negotiations.  Trade is a competitive business, and by opening up the negotiations to the public (not just in the U.S., but to the very countries we are competing against), we undermine the process and take away our leverage to get the best deal possible for Americans.  \n\nThis isn’t secrecy; it’s how negotiations work.  The bill I am voting for today ensures that as your representative, I can access the sensitive negotiations at any time.  \n\nConfidentiality ends with the culmination of the negotiations.  Once agreements are reached with our trading partners, they will be subject to the scrutiny of the world, and ultimately cannot move forward without the explicit vote of Congress.  If it’s a bad agreement, I will vote against it.  If it’s a good agreement, I will vote for it.  \n\nSimply put, new trade agreements, or any agreement, would NEVER be struck without a confidential process that allows us to get the best deal possible, without our competitors interfering.	1042317852459131
183180288372896	I appreciate all of the feedback I have received on trade legislation being considered in the House this week. While I shared many of the concerns mentioned on this page, after more closely examining the merits of these concerns, I realized they are predominantly based on misinformation.  \n\nMost importantly, I want to be clear that the House is not voting on the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) this week.  The TPP has been in negotiation since 2007, beginning under President Bush, and would open up new markets to U.S. goods and services, boosting our national economy.  These negotiations are sensitive.  Countries party to TPP negotiations must have trust and confidence in the process, which again, is still ongoing.  While there will be no vote this week on the TPP, there will be a vote on the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) which would subject TPP negotiations to greater transparency.\n\nThe TPA is anything but a “fast track” to new trade agreements.  In fact, I’d prefer to call it “slow track.”  TPA requires negotiated trade proposals to be available to the public for 60 days.  At the end of 60 days, Congress must then vote on the proposed agreement before it can be implemented.  In no way does TPA grant the President unilateral authority to write and implement new trade agreements.  \n\nThe process of developing agreements requires negotiators for each respective party.  In the private sector, these negotiators are typically CEOs.  For the U.S. government, dating back to the 1930s, our negotiator is the President.  In the private sector, CEOs must report to the Board, who provides negotiation guidance and directives.  For the U.S. government, the Congress acts as the Board by providing the President guidance and directives.  \n\nThere are over 100 negotiation directives TPA places on the President as he continues trade negotiations.  If the President doesn’t meet these directives, Congress can overrule the President.  You can read these directives, and the entire text of the TPA legislation here - https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr1314/BILLS-114hr1314eas.xml.  \n\nIf you want to restrain the President’s authority in trade negotiations and inject transparency into the process, including a mandatory 60 day public review period, then TPA is the way to do so.	1041856992505217
183180288372896	Today, I helped lead the House passage of six bills to assist our veterans.\n \nFive of these bills provide veterans with contracting opportunities, housing assistance, and access to an identification document that verifies their service.

183180288372896	Today, on the 70th Anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day, the Arsenal Of Democracy Flyover was held.\n\nI was honored to be asked to participate with my friend and colleague Representative Sam Graves because I cannot think of a better way to mark this historic day, and the countless sacrifices that were made by our men and women in uniform, than roaring down the National Mall in the very aircraft that helped secure victory over Nazi Germany.  I am honored to recognize the hundreds of WWII vets attending the ceremony, along with the thousands of others that could not make it to the event.  This truly was a special occasion.	1022679654422951
183180288372896	The House is expected to consider Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation as early as this week.  I am supportive of this authority, because without it, the U.S. would effectively cede global leadership to countries like China. TPA maintains the oversight role of Congress.  It  gives the President national trade objectives to meet as part of any future trade agreement.  If he fails to meet these objectives, Congress could reject the deal.  TPA also allows Congress AND the public 60 days to read the text of any trade agreement.  \n\nAs your Representative, I want to give you a voice in future trade agreements and make sure the 7,000 Hoosier jobs supported directly by trade stay in the 4th District.  TPA creates a pathway for considering trade agreements that would expand the economic reach of Indiana businesses.  One of the biggest winners with these agreements are Hoosier farmers.  In 2013, Indiana exported $4.8 billion worth of agricultural products - soy, corn and pork were the top exports.  To read the TPA legislation for yourself, please visit https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr1314/BILLS-114hr1314eas.xml\n\n#TPA4USJOBS	1041282539229329

While ObamaCare contains many job-killing taxes and regulations, the medical device tax is among the most egregious.  Medical device makers will be taxed $29 billion over a decade for each life-saving device the company’s manufacture, including pacemakers and stents.  Since taking office, I have led the charge against ObamaCare and the medical device tax.  It is time to end this tax.	1034587023232214
183180288372896	Raisbeck Aviation High School is a small aviation and aerospace school in Tukwila, WA.  Schools like Raisbeck are on the cutting-edge of public-private partnerships.\n\nThe school is located on land owned by the Museum of Flight.  On a daily basis, students can see the museum's outdoor exhibits which include a Concorde.  The first Boeing 737 and 747 are located just outside the cafeteria, too.

183180288372896	I believe a cornerstone of our Republic is based on our First Amendment right to free speech.  If Americans are not free to speak their mind, regardless of how offensive, unwise, or ignorant their comments may be, the very premise of our free and open society will be undermined.  \n\nThere is no more important place to protect free speech than on the campuses of our colleges and universities.  I am shocked and dismayed by the stories I’ve heard from across the country where individual voices, particularly from those with conservative views, have been censored or silenced altogether.\n\nEarlier this month, Purdue University again made headlines for breaking the mold in higher education.  Under the leadership of President Mitch Daniels, Purdue became the first public institution to adopt free speech principles similar to those first implemented by the University of Chicago.  These principles earned the University a “green light” rating from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE).\n\nIn part, Purdue’s new policies read, “Because Purdue University is committed to free and open inquiry in all matters, it guarantees all members of the University community the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge and learn.”  \n\nLike if you support free speech.	1031773463513570

183180288372896	President Obama’s activist EPA continues to run roughshod over the U.S. economy by moving forward with their disastrous Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule.  This decision will cost hardworking Hoosier jobs, hurting our small business owners, farmers, and manufacturers.  Despite the 700,000 public comments submitted opposing the rule, including more than 30 governors, the EPA continues their job-killing, regulatory power grab. \n\nTo stop this madness, the House passed the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act on May 12.  As an original cosponsor, I strongly support this bipartisan bill, which requires the EPA to withdraw the rule and work with stakeholders to find the proper regulatory balance.  It is now pending review in the U.S. Senate.  I will continue to fight against this regulatory overreach and protect our Hoosier economy.	1031185516905698

183180288372896	I had a great day of meetings with Hoosiers working in the agriculture industry.  It started with a stop at Sheridan’s JBS United, an international company specializing in research-based animal nutrition products.  I then headed over to Atlanta to meet with the folks from Beck’s Hybrids.  They’re the largest family-owned retail seed company in the country.  I ended the afternoon at Kokomo Grain Co.  They operate a number of facilities across Indiana, including Amboy, Romney, Winamac, and Kokomo.  The company sells grains to processors and has a licensed capacity of 39 million bushels.	1021742901183293
183180288372896	On Saturday I had the opportunity to participate in the 4th Annual Vettes for Vets event in West Lafayette, benefiting Indiana's Veteran's Home.  Over 100 veterans came out to enjoy the Corvettes and the beautiful weather.  Here are a few pictures from the event.	1021316544559262

183180288372896	Today, the House approved the Budget Conference Committee agreement.  This budget represents a great opportunity to change our nation’s fiscal trajectory, address the drivers of our debt, and strengthen the future for our children and grandchildren.  This budget is the beginning, not the end, of a larger opportunity to lead our country forward.  While much work remains, we need to celebrate the fact that after fourteen years, the House has once again passed a budget conference committee agreement.  I look forward to helping lead us to a solution.\n\nThis budget puts us on a path to balance in less than ten years, restore fiscal sanity to Washington, and control our runaway federal spending by reforming auto-pilot entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nI was honored to serve on the conference committee that forged this agreement.  This budget agreement is the path to greater certainty for the future and will truly help all people build better lives for themselves and their families.  The House vote was 226 in favor and 197 against.  The Senate is expected to consider the measure next week.	1019051711452412
183180288372896	Today, I cheered on Indiana’s Teacher of the Year at a ceremony at the White House.  Kathy Nimmer, an English teacher at Official William Henry Harrison High School - West Lafayette, was a finalist for the 2015 National Teacher of the Year.	1018531678171082

345331988887412	The president's indecisive and incoherent foreign policy has led us to this point in history. Evil is a constant in this fragile world. And evil feeds and grows on indecisive indifference.\n\nI support our nation pursuing and eliminating the evil that is ISIS. But this pursuit will only be successful with a clear, decisive plan that moves the world towards long term peace.	690637397690201
345331988887412	In our district, as in the majority of Iowa, we have a duty to ensure that agriculture and the future of the American farmer is secure.

345331988887412	Today, we released the Fiscal Year 2015 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Bill that provides funding for or nations infrastructure and housing needs. \n\nMy priorities in this process were to act in a bipartisan fashion to fund our most vital programs with our critical need to reduce the deficit. This is a sound, commonsense bill that meets our highest transportation and housing priorities in a fiscally responsible way. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move this important legislation forward in an open legislative process.\n\nhttp://appropriations.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=379006	622103051210303

345331988887412	Whether you support or oppose the new health care law -- we all know it was promoted as something that would help uninsured Americans.

165730996804553	I'm about to start my St. Marys Town Hall, but I wanted to share some interactions from my visit to Wamego High School: \n \nI told them about our national debt and asked them how many zeros were in a trillion. "Too many" one said. Yes, too many. \n \nTeacher Will Clark asked if any of the students were happy with their school lunches. They laughed. "They don't have butter for our rolls!"\n\nI heard from a student whose dad is an Afghanistan Veteran. The student had heard that the VA is notorious for bad care. I talked about the Veterans' Choice Program and how it is meant to allow Veterans to choose where to get their care when the VA is too far away or not able to care for them promptly.	954313661279612

While the EPA is seeking to fundamentally change how electricity is generated, distributed, and consumed in the United States, H.R. 2042 works to ensure states retain control of their electricity markets and can keep prices affordable. The bill gives states the right to determine if EPA’s standards are, in fact, in their states’ best interest. If a state were to find that those standards aren’t in the best interest of families, businesses, and consumers then they simply don’t have to implement them. #CoalKeepstheLightsOn	10152819636975426

131279995382	Having worked at the East Millinocket mill for more than 29 years, the news about the mill is extremely personal.   \n\nThese workers are among the best papermakers in the world, and I am optimistic a buyer can and will be found to resume operations at the mill. I stand ready to assist  in that effort in whatever way I can.  Until then, we will leave no stone unturned in providing relief to the hardworking employees who, through no fault of their own, have been impacted by this ongoing disruption of operations.\n\nWhen the original announcement to shut down the mill first came, we helped put together a dislocated worker response team to help with lifelines like training and employment services, and I will continue to work to ensure every federal resource possible is made available. I also expect Cate Street to live up to its financial obligations to the mill workers and towns over the coming months.	10154479670805383

131279995382	Last night, I returned home to East Millinocket for the first time since the news broke earlier this week that Great Northern was filing bankruptcy. As I drove by the mill, my heart just broke. I worked at that mill for more than 29 years. The Katahdin region is my home – it’s where I grew up and where I will retire. The families impacted by the decline of the mills are my friends, neighbors and former co-workers. During my trip home and over the last couple of days, I’ve had the opportunity to talk with other people in my community about the bankruptcy, what it means for the future, and what we can do at the federal level to help.\n\nThe decline in manufacturing in our state is not new. One of the reasons I ran for Congress was to advocate for fairer trade policies that strengthen American and Maine manufacturers. Maine’s millworkers are the finest in the world, hands down. But they are being hurt by trade policies that give foreign countries an unfair advantage. In Congress, I have worked to call out these unfair subsidies and I have spurred action when other countries break the rules at the expense of our workers.\n\nWe’ve made some progress, but changing international trade policy is a long process – and my community can’t afford to wait. When the original announcement to shut down the mill came, we put together a response team to help with lifelines like training and employment services. We helped secure Trade Adjustment Assistance. I will continue to do everything I can to secure federal support for the region. I say this not because I’m an elected official – I say it because we’re talking about my home town, and an institution that employed generations of my own family. We have a tough road ahead of us, but I know that if we all continue having each other’s backs, we can only emerge from this challenge stronger.	10154655155695383

Mike also co-sponsored the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2012, which was designed to bring government, business, and labor stakeholders together to formulate comprehensive national strategies to attract manufacturing businesses back to the U.S., help domestic manufacturers compete overseas, and encourage them to expand and create U.S. jobs.	10154652035735383

131279995382	I was honored to join Vice President Biden in meeting with the hardworking men and women at Portsmouth Naval Yard today. This was a tremendous way to illustrate to the Vice President the importance of investing in the American worker – and that includes trade policies that strengthen manufacturing right here at home! Our workers are the finest in the world, and they deserve a level playing field.	10154573132730383
131279995382	I was honored to spend part of my Labor Day presenting service medals to two of our veterans. Reggie Doucette served in the Korean War, and Mike Woolley is a World War II Navy vet. Thank you both for your service!	10154569028860383
131279995382	The Transportation Safety Board of Canada released the findings of their investigation into last year’s Lac-Mégantic rail disaster today, and I’m glad we have a clearer sense of what caused the accident and what we need to focus on to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring again. We’ve made good progress over the last year – we’ve taken steps to increase coordination between railroads and local communities on emergency response; and have tightened regulations around the transport of volatile forms of crude oil. And I’ll continue advocating for the administration to implement additional safety standards and regulations, so we never have a repeat of Lac-Mégantic.	10154517414145383
131279995382	It was great to catch up with Dr. Habib Dagher at the Advanced  Structures and Composites Center on the University of Maine Campus in Orono.

131279995382	I'm proud to be at Fort Belvoir today as President Obama signs our bipartisan VA bill into law. This bill will address many of the immediate problems facing the Department of Veterans Affairs, like wait times. VA Secretary Bob McDonald is here today as well, and I look forward to working with him over the long-term as we begin the work of truly reforming the Department.	10154470516755383
131279995382	Congratulations to Bob McDonald, who was just confirmed as the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs by a 97-0 Senate vote.

131279995382	I was excited to join many of my House colleagues this morning to launch the State Medicaid Expansion Caucus. I feel strongly about expanding Medicaid in Maine because it means increasing access to healthcare for nearly 70,000 Mainers, including about 3,000 veterans; and it will strengthen our economy – creating upwards of 3,100 jobs.	10154417679705383
131279995382	Today, I joined Rep. Jeff Miller and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Richard Burr in leading the first meeting of our VA Conference Committee. As we begin this important work on behalf of our nation’s veterans, I hope we all see beyond the immediate crisis and seize this opportunity to enact substantive, long-term improvements to the VA system. Ensuring our veterans receive high-quality, timely and safe healthcare is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue, but an American one. And there are no monopolies on good ideas.	10154311347425383

109304033877	It is hard to comprehend the hate and evil that surfaced in Charleston last week, but we must fully acknowledge the shortcomings of our society if we ever hope to better it. A toxic mix of hatred and easy access to guns led to this awful tragedy, but we are not powerless to change our future. Taking down the Confederate flag is a necessary and important step toward healing the wounds of a shameful era of institutionalized racism. It is long past time to stop giving false validation to those who claim its symbolism can be separated from its heritage of hate. We must re-dedicate ourselves to the urgent work of building a more perfect union and ending the epidemic of gun violence.	10153083823703878

210401648605	Since its implementation in 2013, Obamacare’s excise tax on medical device manufacturers, like those that manufacture pace makers, artificial joint replacements, and medical imaging equipment, has hurt many of the American companies whose products patients rely on to improve and sustain their quality of life.  As a result of this burdensome tax, many manufacturers have been forced to lay off employees and/or reduce investments in research and development – stifling medical innovation.

573002239470919	Since coming to Congress, one of my main priorities has been getting more people back to work. I have been a consistent supporter of legislation and ideas that will not only help get Americans back to work, but will keep more money in their pockets. So, when the House started to debate Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) earlier this month, I took a hard look at how many jobs free trade agreements create and how this will help not only those in the 3rd District, but Americans across our country. \n \nAs of this year, more than 39.8 million American jobs depend on trade meaning, which is one in every five. There has been a lot of misinformation floating around the media regarding TPA and I would like to set the record straight. The “fast track” vote, as it is commonly referred to, outlines the first step that is needed to set the process for negotiating and approving trade agreements. A vote in support of TPA shifts the power from the president and ensures that Congress and the American people have a greater role in negotiating trade agreements. Without it, the president would continue to negotiate without Congressional input and outside of the public eye. Let me make clear, under TPA, Congress retains total control over international trade authority granted to it by the U.S. Constitution. Any trade agreement negotiated by the president under TPA still must be approved separately by Congress. This is critically important, because, without TPA, Congress and the American people have less of an ability to hold the president accountable for his actions in international negotiations. There are 20 countries with trade agreements and there is a trade surplus – and with others there is a deficit.\n \nRecently, the House considered the Trade Act of 2015. This legislation included over 150 provisions that would establish specific rules and objectives for international trade negotiations, and would require Congress to have ongoing access to important negotiating documents. In addition, this bill would codify into law that documents of a trade agreement must be made public for Americans to read 60 days before Congress can hold a vote on its approval. \n \nFree trade agreements bring new export opportunities, new production demands, create new jobs, and boost our nation’s economy. In Missouri, there are 815,374 trade related jobs. And of the more than $14.5 billion of annual Missouri exports, 51 percent goes to existing free trade agreement partners, which is why it is essential we establish new trading relationships that will give Missouri goods and services greater access to the 95 percent of the world’s consumers who live outside of the United States. For example, Missouri farmers and ranchers export more than $4.1 billion in goods annually.  \n \nFor many Missourians, particularly those who work each and every day in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, TPA is of the upmost importance and is a critical first step in ensuring the United States remains a leader in the global market place.	695622250542250

139631049438354	Free trade is vital to the U.S. economy and is important to sharpen our global edge.  However, accurate information is also vital when considering any trade policy.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation and outright falsehoods being spread by different groups concerning our negotiations on trade.  Here is my assessment of what is important for everyone to consider.  \n\nFree trade agreements are negotiated through the Executive Branch, which, given the track record of the Obama Administration’s foreign and economic policies, is a concern.  Many southwest Missourians have told me they do not trust President Obama to negotiate trade deals, which is exactly why we need a mechanism to keep presidential power in check.\n\nTrade Promotion Authority (TPA) is that mechanism, which Congress established in 1934 to strengthen its constitutional obligations to regulate trade with foreign nations and check the executive’s power while streamlining the trade agreement approval process.  It last lapsed in 2007, and every president except Nixon and Obama has had TPA since Franklin Roosevelt. \n\nAs proposed, TPA would give Congress access to trade negotiations and require any negotiated trade deal to be public for 60 days prior to Congress making a decision.  That strengthens accountability and transparency and makes sure we fully understand the ramifications of any trade deal.  It sets 150 objectives any trade deal must meet to be considered under TPA.  Any deal failing to meet the objectives in this TPA bill would be denied ‘fast-track authority’ and would be subject to congressional amendment.  Congress would ultimately have the final say on trade deals, allowing the American people to hold their elected officials accountable.  \n\nTPA is *not* a trade deal, but rather a step added to the free trade agreement process.  TPA has been confused with another acronym: TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  TPP continues to be negotiated among 12 nations surrounding the Pacific Ocean; therefore, TPP does not yet exist.  TPA would be used to make TPP and other free trade deals over the next six years, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), more transparent and expose its details up to two months before Congress takes any final action.  I voted for TPA because I want to see what is in TPP, and I want you to see it too.\n\nFree trade helps American businesses access the 96 percent of the global market residing beyond our borders.  TPA would be a law guiding negotiations to make sure free trade agreements are a win for American workers and to put us on a level playing field with countries that would not otherwise adhere to our rules.  In other words, we set the standards for global trade – not China.  We can make sure Americans get the best deal possible.  We can grow the more than $650 million free trade impact on Missouri’s Seventh District.  We can get more Ozarks-, Missouri- and American-made products to people around the world.	809744832426969

139631049438354	Due to procedure outlined in the War Powers Resolution, the House had to take a vote this afternoon on a resolution to remove U.S. armed forces from Iraq and Syria. It failed, 139-288.\n\nWe face a rapidly evolving threat as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) continues to spread its influence around the world and grow in size.  This Islamic extremist militant group seeks to destroy America and anyone not adhering to their beliefs, and it has already taken thousands of Christian lives.  We, at the very least, need American air power and military minds on the ground to work against ISIL’s military mission.  I voted today to reject the notion of withdrawing U.S. forces from the region.  Removing military force against ISIL would be dangerous, and would only empower the terror organization.  What we need to do is the opposite and move to debate a formal authorization of military force in the region to combat the threats America and our allies face.	809455622455890
139631049438354	Roads and bridges – we all use them, and they are deteriorating with each passing day.  Our transportation system was once the envy of the world, but we now find ourselves dodging potholes and crossing deficient bridges.  This week, the House passed H.R. 2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016, to invest in our infrastructure and dedicate funds for high-priority programs to make America’s transportation system reliable, safe and efficient.\n\nTransportation funding is an issue from the local level all the way to the federal level. We, in southwest Missouri, will soon see the policy implications of a prolonged transportation debate, where dwindling state funds could clash with uncertainty surrounding federal transportation funding.  At the heart of the debate is the Federal Highway Trust Fund (HTF), which since 1956 has provided states assistance with transportation construction and maintenance project costs and is primarily funded with federal gas tax revenue.  HTF covers approximately 80 percent of state project costs.  Without certainty for highway funds moving forward, state transportation departments, such as MoDOT, cannot plan to fix critical infrastructure problems or maintain the existing system.  They can only plan for short-term, low-cost maintenance and minimal safety improvements.\n\nTwenty-two percent of Missouri’s major roadways have a “poor” rating and 23 percent of bridges need to be repaired, improved or replaced.  This leads to bad roads, which are costly for drivers.  As a result, an April 2015 study shows Springfield metro area drivers lose $1,134 annually due to additional vehicle operating costs, congested-related delays and crashes.    \n\nOur nation’s economy is built on our infrastructure – whether it is the roadways, railways and tarmacs to get goods to markets or providing jobs for those who build.  If our infrastructure crumbles, so goes our economy.  We need to have a solid plan to continue HTF and prevent further deterioration of infrastructure.  H.R. 2577 provides HTF with $40.25 billion next fiscal year, pending Congress’ reauthorization of the program in July.  I look forward to lively debate on long-term HTF reauthorization, providing states with certainty on a path forward before the program expires at the end of the summer.	807368419331277

I continue to support efforts to close the border, to give agencies patrolling the border the resources they need and to enforce the laws already on the books. Only then can we truly see which policies work and begin steps toward real reform. \n\nSidestepping Congress and the law is clearly not a winning solution.	800178730050246
139631049438354	For more than a year, the House Energy and Commerce Committee (E&C) has been working with doctors, patients, drug manufacturers, government researchers and regulators to investigate how we, as Congress, can help advancements in American medical innovation and treatments.  This week, these efforts passed E&C unanimously, 51-0, to be brought before the full House of Representatives.\n\nThe 21st Century Cures Act would take multiple approaches to enhance the federal government’s positive impact on medical research and development and while breaking down regulations hindering medical advancements.  The bill would facilitate public-private partnerships to spur further innovation, establish a priority process for the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) review of breakthrough medical devices and treatments, and grant additional resources to federal agencies such as FDA, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service.  This only scratches the surface.\n\nIn the fields of medical research and drug development, government should not be what holds America back from reaching our full potential.  21st Century Cures is a strong step to make that a reality.\n\nFor example, I am the lead sponsor of H.R. 2452, which is included in 21st Century Cures as section 2101.  It would allow drug manufacturers, which have the most in-depth sophisticated information about their products, to share important data with certain health care professionals.  This would arm medical providers with scientifically-sound economic data needed to ensure the most effective and efficient treatments for specific patients with specific conditions.  Doctors would have better understanding of which drugs work best for certain patients, opening informed competition and driving innovation for better drugs and successful treatments.\n\n21st Century Cures is groundbreaking landmark legislation that would do wonders to streamline researchers and scientists’ work to develop cures and treatments of modern day diseases.  It would give doctors the tools they need to provide Americans with high-quality, world class care.  It would implement real reforms to the governing bureaucracy and improve the American medical landscape.  As the father of a cancer patient, I know the great impact every American individual and family would feel as a result of this powerful bill.	797497400318379
139631049438354	Today marks four years since the E-F5 tornado devastated Joplin. This is not just a day to reflect on the tragedy and those lost in the disaster, but a day to celebrate great strides the people of Joplin have made to overcome. I am so proud of the community in the city and the region for coming together as one to pick up the pieces, rebuild and make a strong recovery. Joplin’s spirit remains unbroken and is stronger than ever.	797439923657460
139631049438354	Today is another victory in our fight against ISIL. With this successful operation, Abu Sayyaf, a top ISIL commander and mastermind of its oil and gas operations providing a primary funding source for the terror organization, has been taken out and its leadership diminished. \n\nI applaud the intelligence community in the region and our brave U.S. Special Forces for carrying out this mission and once again showing that ISIL is not invincible and cannot hide from the best. I will continue being an avid supporter of the fight against Islamic extremism. Jihad has no place in our world. These efforts are absolutely necessary to keep our nation, Americans and Christians everywhere safe from persecution and harm	794490120619107
139631049438354	The federal government’s primary responsibility to the nation is providing for the common defense.  Ensuring America is safe and secure should be the utmost priority.  Our Founding Fathers believed it to be so, placing it front and center in the Preamble to the Constitution.  This is relevant now more than ever as America faces few graver threats than the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, also known as ISIL.\n\nIn the past year, the world has watched in horror as the jihadist group of Islamic extremists take lives and territory while degrading the success of past American military efforts.  American and coalition military efforts have met the militants on the front lines in cities and towns throughout Iraq and Syria with some success in depressing ISIL’s advances; but, the issue stretches far beyond geopolitics.  This savage group has beheaded Americans and a number of others.  Religious minorities, especially Christians, in the region have been the target of the Islamic extremist group’s heinous acts, such as the February 2015 beheadings of Egyptian Christian missionaries on a Libyan beach.\n\nRecently, President Obama sent Congress his proposal for the Authorized Use of Military Force against ISIL.  The proposal calls for a three-year anti-ISIL military operation without the option for “enduring ground combat operations” while ensuring proper oversight of the mission.  However, Congress will not rubberstamp the president’s request, and we will have a rational debate to make certain the strongest steps are taken to ensure safety both at home and abroad.\n\nISIL and Islamic extremists are a serious threat to American interests and allies.  We must show the world our nation has the resolve to defeat this threat.  We must give our military the tools needed to defeat Islamic extremists and not tie the military’s hands and limit its options to defeating this threat.  I look forward to a vigorous debate on steps forward as Congress considers the president’s request.	764682933599826
139631049438354	Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers jointly proposed a rule “clarifying” the definition of waterways subject to clean water permits, known as “waters of the U.S.”  In reality, the “clarification” amounts to a massive land and water grab.  It would have a devastating impact on everyday life in the Ozarks, which is why I voted this week to pass the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, which would force the EPA to withdraw and reconsider this ridiculous rule.\n\nThe EPA and the Corps currently only have permit-issuing authority to uphold the natural integrity of our navigable waterways, interstate streams, territorial seas or connected wetlands.  The existing standards have been in place since the Clean Water Act of 1972.  The proposed expansion, however, would broaden federal power to tributaries, ditches, streams only flowing during heavy rains and waters in flood plains.  \n\nThis massive shift would give the all-powerful EPA authority to require farmers that plow and plant to seek permits beforehand.  Construction of barns, homes or businesses would need a permit as well due to potential impact on a local stream.  Highway ditches and infrastructure would fall under the expansion.  Even if the nearest running stream is miles away, the typically dry creek nearby would be considered a “water of the U.S.” and any activity surrounding the creek would be unnecessarily stuck with red tape, which could take months to comply with.\n\nI have heeded the concerns of Seventh District farmers, businesses and officials about this absurd regulation.  It would have undue harm on our area’s economy and way of life.  That’s why I voted to force the EPA to withdraw the regulation and consider the economic costs, Supreme Court cases and comments from farmers, businesses, state and local officials and anyone whom a reconsidered rule would impact.  After all, it is those caring for the land and resources who know best how to protect them.\n\nI will continue to fight against the EPA and its nonsensical regulations that pay no mind to generations-old southwest Missouri lifestyles and traditions.	793940257340760
139631049438354	The House just passed the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, which would force EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw and reconsider is proposed "Waters of the U.S." rule.\n\nI have heeded the call of Seventh District farmers, businesses and officials who have sounded the alarm on this absurd regulation. The ‘Waters of the U.S.’ proposal poses a risk of farmers being bogged down with red tape to seek federal approval before plowing, running cattle or carrying out long-standing traditional agriculture practices. Further, any construction of homes or businesses would need approval before causing any potential change in water run-off patterns. It would devastate our local economy. This would have a significant adverse impact on daily life in the Ozarks, and it cannot stand.  We must end big government’s tirade and hold unelected bureaucrats accountable to consequences of their ill-informed actions.	792722037462582
139631049438354	I had the pleasure this week of visiting several southwest Missouri manufacturers and seeing firsthand the great products created right here in our district.  On Thursday, I toured the Springfield Coach Group, where they buy new cars and proceed to cut them in half to turn into limousines.  I also visited the National Audio Company, which makes a lot of products for the Library of Congress in Washington.  Then it was on to Leggett & Platt Flex-O-Lators factory in Carthage and New Aire Fireplace Systems in Carl Junction.  Friday, I attended a groundbreaking ceremony in Ozark for Springfield-based Allen Global Companies and celebrated its expansion into Kazakhstan.\n\nFederal trade and foreign affairs policy have a central place in many of these businesses as well as numerous others around the district.  Over the past five years, 12 businesses in the Seventh District have received Export-Import Bank assistance, helping southwest Missouri-made products make it to the global market.  I co-sponsor a bill to reauthorize Ex-Im through 2019 and allow for continued success from Missouri businesses abroad. \n\nTrade partnerships build foreign relationships and open doors for American businesses, such as Allen Global.  I hosted Kazakhstan Ambassador Kariat Umarov in August 2014 to tour Ozarks businesses including Allen Global, which ultimately led to its expansion of Allen Filtration Eurasia, which will soon distribute southwest-Missouri-made products to Kazakh companies. The U.S. and Kazakhstan have mutually benefited from our 22-year-old trade partnership, with the perks now seen here in the Ozarks.\n\nAlso important is Trade Promotion Authority, which is currently being crafted in Congress and would bring us a step closer to solidifying trade deals to benefit the American workforce and elevate America’s standing on the world stage.  Specifically, manufactures such as Leggett & Platt, Springfield Coach Builders and Allen Filtration that do business overseas stand to benefit from growing trade partnerships abroad, with a better chance of opening their products to and accessing new markets.   With more than 815,000 jobs in Missouri tied to trade, southwest Missouri families and workers would certainly feel the benefits of streamlined trade negotiation. \n\nAll in all, hard work has shaped our American history.  It is a priority of mine to help America’s manufacturers have the steam to forge a strong future.  The best way we can build that reality is to cut Washington’s unnecessary red tape, create a tax structure that encourages business and maintain a strong, open global trade.  I will remain a staunch advocate for policies to help business, create jobs and grow our economy.	790983117636474
139631049438354	I had a great time on the Seventh District Manufacturing Tour yesterday. Business is booming in southwest Missouri.

139631049438354	This week, the House and Senate agreed on a budget resolution, setting the framework for how Congress will appropriate funds for federal departments and agencies.  It cuts $5 trillion and balances the budget within 10 years without a tax increase while calling for Obamacare's repeal, strengthening national defense and preserving Social Security and Medicare.  With that, the House has begun one of its most important responsibilities, executing its "power of the purse."\n\nThe House passed two appropriations bills - one for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and military construction; the other for energy and water development programs - setting funding for various federal agencies and programs.\n\nWith this legislation, the VA would see a 5.6 percent funding boost, enhancing its ability to serve our nation's veterans while also strengthening the investigative arm of the agency, making sure the VA is held accountable for quality of care provided.  The bill would move us closer toward a modernized and paperless VA benefit processing system to reduce the notorious benefits backlog.  The Department of Defense would receive an increase for housing and training troops and ensuring our brave men and women on the frontlines have the equipment they need to succeed.  It would also ensure 1.4 million military families have excellent housing, fund medical facility construction for 9.8 million beneficiaries and wounded warriors, and support anti-terror operations such as operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nRegarding the energy and water development bill, the Department of Energy (DOE) would have to use additional funds to accommodate and prioritize an "all of the above" energy approach, efficiently utilizing all of our God-given domestic natural resources and moving us closer to energy independence.  The bill also prohibits implementation of EPA's "Waters of the U.S." rule, which would have a major negative impact on southwest Missouri's agriculture and economy.\n\nThese are the first two of 12 appropriations bills Congress needs to pass ahead of each fiscal year, which begins October 1.  This is the earliest the House has begun work on appropriations bills since 1974.\n\nI look forward to working on the rest of the appropriations bills and carrying out my Constitutional duty while upholding fiscal accountability.	787369981331121
139631049438354	Responsible budgeting means prioritizing spending, and balancing revenue and expenses to live within our means.  Washington should not consider itself exempt from that common sense principle.  Today, we passed a budget agreed upon with the Senate to balance the budget with a $5 trillion spending cut and without raising taxes, repeal Obamacare, maintain a strong defense and protect Medicare and Social Security.  With this budget framework, we are returning to fiscal responsibility.	787042158030570

139631049438354	The Second Amendment is engrained within Southwest Missouri culture from hunting and sporting to self-defense.  Many folks raise their children with firearms safety in mind, teaching the proper way to use them and respecting the law.  I remember going from my first BB gun to my pellet gun then to Grandpa Long's 16 gauge single shot and then to my Uncle Diemer Long's .22 cal.  Ruger Single Six pistol that I still have.  Many in the Ozarks went through a similar progression in their youth.  For so many Americans, the Second Amendment is more than just self-defense, it's a way of life.\n\nThe ATF was forced to pull a proposed rule to re-classify .223-caliber M855 green tip ammunition as an "armor piercing bullet" after getting bombarded with negative comments on their proposed bullet ban.\n\nThe Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act defines "armor piercing bullet" as "projectiles constructed from specified material [such as tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper or depleted uranium] which may be used in handguns."  The law provides exclusions for hunting, target shooting and sport.  ATF has actually considered M855s a form of sport ammunition since 1986.  Although .223s are most popularly used in AR-15s and not handguns, ATF cited concerns among the law enforcement community that the bullets could be used in newer versions of handguns as a weapon against officers- a concern that supersedes the hunting or sport exclusions.\n\nATF's proposed rule was incredibly concerning, and I am glad they pulled it.  I saw this as a back door assault by the Obama administration on our Second Amendment rights through another-'simple fix' with his pen and phone.  I strongly objected to the rule change because I saw it as an attempt to ban ammunition, rather than guns themselves, through market controls.  That is why I, along with more than 235 of my House colleagues sent a letter to ATF Director B. Todd Jones to state our objections, demand answers and urge the Bureau's reconsideration of the rule.\n\nRest assured that I strongly oppose any new restrictions interfering with our Second Amendment rights and actively seek removal of those restrictions - whether they arise in legislation, an executive agency, or from the president's continual abuse of executive power.	761789387222514

139631049438354	Americans now live in an online world.  Many interact with friends and family on email or Facebook, bank and shop online, and store important information on computer networks.  Unfortunately, we have come to face the ugly reality of criminals who steal personal information, hack into business and government files or, worse, leverage online infrastructure vulnerabilities for terror.  Southwest Missourians know this all too well with recent hacks into Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and Target.\n\nOur ability to secure the web has been held back even with the great technological advancement made in the past 10 years.  The House passed this week two bills directly addressing the need to bolster cybersecurity and would remove unnecessary hurdles to creating a safe, secure online environment without infringing on Americans’ privacy. \n\nThe Protecting Cyber Networks Act (PCNA) would allow private companies to share threat information with each other, whereas private entities are currently prohibited from doing so, and allow voluntary sharing of threat information with the federal government.  Keeping Americans’ privacy concerns in mind, neither the National Security Agency (NSA) nor the Department of Defense would receive the reports.  Companies would be required to remove all personal data before sharing intelligence, and federal agencies receiving the reports would automatically conduct an additional removal of any private information before investigation.\n  \nThe National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act would grant private companies legal protections to fight threats and share threat information with the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, an integration center within the Department of Homeland Security working with the federal government, intelligence community, and law enforcement for cyberattack response and prevention.  Privacy protections like those in PCNA are included in this bill. The only information shared with the federal government is cyber threat indicators. No personal information would be shared.\n \nI voted in favor of these strong, bipartisan bills to ensure businesses have the tools necessary to fend off online threats.  The House has taken the lead on cybersecurity bills in recent years, but most died in the Democrat-controlled Senate.  I look forward to the Senate’s action on these critical bills and giving Americans a greater sense of security and peace of mind.	783731268361659
139631049438354	It was a busy week as I and my colleagues worked to stop IRS abuse and modify portions of the tax code, including a repeal of the estate tax, also known as the “death tax”.\n \nI have long-supported getting rid of the death tax to relieve taxation on a lifetime of hard work.  Americans that have carefully planned to leave the family farm, small business or life savings with their children and grandchildren should not have to worry about the federal government robbing up to 40 percent of what is handed down.  Doing well for our future generations is a classic American idea the government should have never trampled on in the first place.  I gladly voted to lay the death tax to rest and hope the Senate will follow suit.\n\nRecently, the IRS has further degraded trust from the American people.  The House passed bills this week to address the agency’s scandal surrounding political targeting of non-profits and the lack of agency accountability.  The legislation would give IRS authority to fire employees engaging in political targeting, prevent IRS from using personal email for official business, grant groups denied non-profit status a chance to appeal and request status of investigations involving personal information.  We also passed a “Taxpayer Bill of Rights” to ensure taxpayers fair treatment and high quality IRS service.\n\nOn another successful note, the Senate passed the House bill to end Medicare’s flawed Sustainable Growth Rate, known as the “doc fix,” and the president signed it into law.  No longer will Medicare doctors face uncertainty with automatic Medicare reimbursement reductions.  This will improve quality of health care and service for seniors.  I am optimistic this paves the way for more serious conversations on reforming Medicare and similar programs in the future.	779767708758015
139631049438354	That annual day of dread is looming: Tax Day.  Each year it becomes more difficult to figure and pay taxes as the U.S. tax code grows longer and much more convoluted.  Studies have shown such a complicated tax code costs Americans $160 billion and 6 billion hours every year.\n\nThe complexity of the U.S. tax code is nonsense and only hinders our full potential.  There are solutions to this self-affliction.  Recently, the House passed its Fiscal Year 2016 budget resolution, setting a framework for a much simpler tax code.  The budget balances in nine years without increasing taxes, and calls for the repeal of Obamacare, which in itself is a $2 trillion tax.\n\nAnother remedy would be the Fair Tax, which continues to be a measure I strongly support.  The Fair Tax would repeal income, corporate, employment and estate taxes and impose a consumption tax on most goods and services.  Even better, it terminates funding for the Internal Revenue Service.  It also would stop all tax cheats and underground ‘off the books businesses’ from avoiding paying their fair share as we all must. Americans work hard for what they make.  Keeping more of what is earned, rather than it being taken, incentivizes work and boosts the economy.  The Fair Tax addresses this common sense notion.\n\nAll in all, the tax code is more than 4 million words long, or more than seven times the length of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings novel series and is not near as interesting.  Closing loopholes, which are inefficient and costly, and simplifying the code to lessen the burden on all Americans would all make for an easier read.  It is past time to move forward with a truly simple, fair and more uniform tax code to better the American economy and strengthen the nation.  I am hopeful we will soon take strides to put these ideas to work and make April 15 just another day on the calendar.	776109322457187

139631049438354	After 17 years of patching the old inner tube, on March 26th the House did the right thing and put on a new tire. We said enough is enough on such an important issue for our seniors and passed a permanent fix to Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR), known as the “doc fix.”  The House passed legislation to permanently repeal this flawed formula and replace it with a plan that strengthens Medicare, providing our seniors with better care.\n\nThe SGR was enacted in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act and has been a chronic source of concern for physicians who serve seniors.  Consistently recognized as an imperfect solution rewarding quantity of services over quality of care, Congress has repeatedly implemented a temporary “doc fix” to prevent substantial Medicare reimbursement rate cuts, which could result in fewer physicians serving Medicare patients.\n\nBy an overwhelming vote of 392 to 37, the House passed a permanent solution to fixing the flawed SGR.  The legislation establishes the first real structural reform to Medicare in nearly two decades without increasing taxes.\n\nI urge the Senate to pass this legislation so Congress can once-and-for-all be done with the short-term fixes to the SGR.  I hope this legislation can serve as a model for future legislative efforts to reform our nation’s programs without increasing the tax burden on Americans.	772832962784823

94590050881	Today we celebrate Earth Day. With so many unique natural treasures in South Jersey, I can't help but think of one of my favorites - Parvin State Park - that holds so many great memories of my childhood. Even as an adult, I always jump at opportunities to go to Parvin. \n\nFacebook friends - what's your favorite South Jersey environmental spot?	10152665184975882

94590050881	Busy day with events in Ocean City and Hammonton today. Will also be on WPG 1450pm at 5pm for the monthly "Ask the Congressman" series, so tune in and call with your questions. I hear that Atlantic City Mayor Guardian will be on right after me at 6pm for those who have questions about what's going on in AC.	10152661203025882
94590050881	Just finished voting to kill the "death tax" that has allowed the federal government to excessively tax South Jersey business owners and farmers on family holdings when their loved ones have died. It is reprehensible that our tax system would seek to capitalize on the death of a family member, often times erasing the hard-work and dedication of generations. Now headed home to lots of events including those in Ocean City, Hammonton and Vineland. Come up & say hi if you see me. Frank	10152653177040882
94590050881	A very joyous day to all those marking the Resurrection as part of their Easter celebrations.	10152630629180882
94590050881	Today is the 5th anniversary of Obamacare & I want to hear how the law has impacted you, your family or business. In my case, I have never accepted taxpayer-funded healthcare, rather Tina & I buy coverage on the private market. When the law was put in place, I was no longer able to keep the plan I liked despite assurances from the Obama Administration. What's YOUR story?	10152606940525882
94590050881	Headed back to Washington tomorrow for votes, meet with constituents, receive intelligence briefings on current national security threats & scheduled to tape an interview with PBS Newshour. Busy week before home to South Jersey. Hope everyone enjoyed the weekend, despite the rain and wind. Frank	10152592292860882
94590050881	Due to weather, both my Mays Landing and Washington offices are closed today. I am checking voicemails in case a constituent has an emergency. Stay safe everyone and thanks to the first responders & road crews working today. Frank	10152571959470882
94590050881	I'm deeply disappointed Congress finds itself at this preventable junction yet again. Given increasing threats abroad & to our homeland, national security concerns must be our FIRST & ONLY consideration. I have made it clear to Speaker Boehner and my colleagues that I support fully funding the Homeland Security department.	10152562429835882
94590050881	My DC office is closed today due to the snow and federal government closure. Staff at my Mays Landing office will be available to help South Jersey residents starting at 11am. Please call 609.625.5008 for assistance. Drive safe, Frank	10152542362660882
94590050881	Appreciate members of the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenpe Indians of NJ Tribal Youth Council and the Vineland Mennonite School for coming to Washington this week to meet with me and my staff. I encourage other South Jersey groups or school outings interested in coming to the Capitol to contact my office to set up a time and tour. Have a great weekend everyone & stay warm! Frank	10152535175085882
94590050881	In November, the President’s go-it-alone policies were once again rebuked by the American people, yet he continues to refuse to genuinely engage Members of Congress of both parties to work together on mutually-agreeable solutions. Controversial and Constitutionally-questionable executive orders further erode any possibility of agreement. From drastic policy changes on Cuba to proposals of hundreds of billions in new spending paid by tax increases, it is clear that cooperation is not on President Obama’s agenda for his final two years. I’m deeply disappointed, though not surprised by the President’s obstinacy to stay his course.\n \nThe American people have witnessed that positive results are achievable when Congress and the President come together for a common goal. From reducing annual deficits to systematic reforms at the Veterans Administration, progress has been made through bipartisan consensus and compromise. Further opportunities for success are possible. However, tonight’s speech did nothing to suggest an interest in such endeavors. Absent from the President’s remarks, South Jersey residents want to know of specific bipartisan plans to lower tax burdens, rebuild our transportation infrastructure, protect American jobs and combat the growing threat of ISIS and terrorism abroad.\n \nFrom energy independence to national security and extending unemployment benefits, I’ve continued to work on these key concerns for South Jersey families. I’d welcome President Obama’s realistic efforts to move forward on any or all of these issues – unfortunately tonight’s address gives me little faith that would occur.	10152494240895882
94590050881	Headed back to Washington for the President's State of the Union address tonight. I'll be posting my thoughts on Facebook following the speech, but want to know your opinions as well. So...what are YOU hoping to hear from President Obama this evening?	10152493098095882
94590050881	Good first week of 114th Congress. 266-153 bipartisan vote + Nebraska Supreme Court approving Keystone XL pipeline = President Obama should sign onto U.S. energy independence, not veto as threatened. Headed back to South Jersey to meet with my Youth Advisory Council tomorrow and attend other community events. Stay warm South Jersey! Frank	10152471890555882
94590050881	Just a reminder that my offices in DC and Mays Landing will be open Monday through Wednesday, Dec 29-31st, from 8:30am to 5:30pm to assist South Jersey residents. Both will be closed on Thursday, January 1st though reopen on Friday, January 2nd.	10152427060745882

195734010571362	It’s been a long road. But we finally made it. A school holiday for Lunar New Year will finally be a reality in New York City. Although I constantly pushed and prodded Mayor de Blasio to make it happen, I always had faith that he'd come through, and I thank him so much for doing so. Thanks also to all who helped play a role and supported our effort to make Lunar New Year a school holiday. Read my remarks from today's press conference with the Mayor: http://1.usa.gov/1LrBFME	677680952376663
195734010571362	Cannot be more excited that Mayor de Blasio will make Lunar New Year a school holiday. Will join him for the official announcement tomorrow. When I served in the State Assembly, I was among the first to introduce legislation that sought to close New York City schools for Lunar New Year. People laughed and said it would never happen. Now, here we are!	677346999076725

195734010571362	Great to see so many people in Times Square today for "Ivory Crush" in which we destroyed more than one ton of confiscated elephant ivory. The event will raise greater awareness about the cruel and horrific practice of elephant poaching, and it will remind the world that the U.S. will continue its fight against wildlife trafficking. It also sends the message loud and clear that that this type of illegal activity will not be tolerated.\n\nIn addition to the conservation issues, ivory trafficking is directly tied to the funding of transnational terrorism and crimes. This is why each year since I was elected to Congress, I have led the bipartisan charge for funding critical global biodiversity and conservation programs affecting wildlife trafficking.\n\nI thank all who took part with me: Actress Kristin Davis (Charlotte from Sex and the City), U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe, N.Y. Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) officials, State Senator Brad Hoylman and many others.	675924085885683

78291598977	Today it was announced that New York City, the largest school district in the country serving 1.1 million students, will recognize #LunarNewYear as a holiday on the official school calendar. \n\nGranting the Lunar New Year the recognition it deserves as a central cultural occasion for so many New Yorkers is an important step in celebrating the diversity of our great City. I am thrilled that Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York City Department of Education Chancellor Carmen Farina have announced that the Lunar New Year will now be an official school holiday, as I have long called for alongside my constituents and colleagues. Hundreds of thousands of families will now be able to celebrate this holiday without sacrificing their children's education.	10153088054343978

7390589055	This year marks the 150th anniversary of Juneteenth, the day when Major General Gordon Granger finally arrived in Galveston, Texas, his last stop in delivering the news of President Abraham Lincoln's historic Emancipation Proclamation which was declared two years prior. Though our Nation has come a long way since Juneteenth of 1865, the fact remains that we still have a way to go. Until our society is free from all racism, discrimination, and violence, we must strive for equality for all.	10153915107209056
7390589055	There are no words to describe the horror and shock of the shooting that occurred in Charleston. Let us pray for the victims , their loved ones and the community during this extremely painful time.	10153912255009056
158290607551599	Honored to meet with Malala Yousafzai today and hear her incredible story of courage and perseverance in the name of global education. After welcoming such a courageous advocate for girls' rights to the U.S. Capitol, my commitment to education is stronger than ever after. We must turn the goal of universal education into a reality.  #Malala	856569061057080
158290607551599	I’m deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, SC, this week. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Hate has no place in houses of worship, and we must all stand together against senseless gun violence.	854733717907281
158290607551599	I was honored to receive the Champions for Children Award at the Child Care Council of Westchester Dream Big Annual Awards Breakfast in Tarrytown. We know that children who receive high-quality child care and are enrolled in early childhood services, such as Head Start, have better outcomes as adults. As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I have fought to increase funding for early childhood programs, and I will continue working in the House to strengthen investments that will start our children on the path to success.	850153115032008
158290607551599	I joined Senator Tom Udall, NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind, and hundreds of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) advocates at the U.S. Department of Transportation this morning for an early-stage prototype presentation of the Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety (DADSS). This new, advanced technology will help reduce alcohol-impaired accidents that take the lives of almost 10,000 people each year. I’ve worked tirelessly to crack down on drunk driving – passing legislation requiring states to enact a maximum Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) level of .08 as a condition of receiving federal transportation assistance, prompting all 50 states and the District of Columbia to implement this commonsense policy – and I will continue working in Congress to ensure strong federal efforts to eliminate drunk driving.	848325521881434
158290607551599	It’s crystal clear that we have a problem with gun violence in this country, and there is so much more that Congress should be doing. I have supported numerous gun control measures that take steps toward keeping our children, neighbors, and communities safe. I was honored to receive the Apple Pie Award today during a 15th Anniversary event of the Million Mom March in Northern Westchester for my work in Congress to prevent gun violence. Moms and families across the United States are fed up with the inaction on gun violence prevention, and I will continue working with national and local groups to ensure all Americans have the right to live in communities free from senseless gun violence. http://1.usa.gov/1GJZMUg #GunSense #GunViolence	845737668806886
158290607551599	At Memorial Day ceremonies throughout Westchester and Rockland, I joined residents in Congers, Orangetown and Montebello this weekend, and today in New Castle with President and Secretary Clinton, Peekskill, and Ossining to pause and pay special recognition to the men and women of the Armed Services who gave their lives in defense of this nation, fighting for democracy and freedom. Their acts of valor and heroic efforts protecting American ideals are the highest form of public service. In their honor, we are charged with the care of their families, who continue to make sacrifices each day. http://1.usa.gov/1HyFdsB	843819275665392
158290607551599	My heart aches for the families who lost loved ones in yesterday’s train derailment in Philadelphia, and I am praying for the swift recovery of those injured in the accident. I’m glad that first responders arrived quickly to the scene to assist, and I urge the NTSB and FRA to conduct a thorough investigation so we can find out what went horribly wrong.	839536289427024
158290607551599	It was wonderful joining WWII veterans, including Chick Galella, and current service members, like Master Sgt. MaryKay Messenger, for the 8th Mission of the Hudson Valley Honor Flight at Westchester County Airport in White Plains. More than 50 WWII veterans from Westchester, Rockland, and surrounding counties were flown to Washington, DC, to spend a day touring our nation’s capital and visiting monuments. These brave members of the Greatest Generation deserve our continued support. I’m proud to have handled more than 2,100 cases to help veterans directly get the services, medals, and benefits they have earned. If you or a veteran you know needs help with the Department of Veterans Affairs or another federal agency, please contact my White Plains District Office (914-428-1707), my New City District Office (845-639-3485), or visit my website for help: http://lowey.house.gov/contact-nita/.	839114366135883
158290607551599	This week is National Small Business Week, which recognizes the important contributions of America’s entrepreneurs and small business owners. I visited small businesses throughout New York’s 17th Congressional District, including General Bearing Corporation in West Nyack earlier this week, and was joined by New York Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul and White Plains Mayor Tom Roach today for a walking tour of White Plains businesses. I have supported tax cuts for small businesses, and have consistently championed funding for the Small Business Administration (SBA) business loan programs, microloans, and workshops to help small businesses get off to a successful start. In 2014, the SBA supported more than $44 million in 7(a) and 504 loans to small businesses in New York’s 17th Congressional District. As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue to support small businesses in the Lower Hudson Valley – the backbone of our economy. #DreamSmallBiz #SmallBusinessWeek	837874789593174
158290607551599	No student should have to fear sexual assault on a college campus, and parents deserve peace of mind that children away at college are as safe as possible. We must work together to make sure that institutions of higher learning have the resources to protect students. That’s why I was at Pace University today for a roundtable discussion with New York Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul and Pace University administrators and students on Governor Andrew Cuomo’s "Enough is Enough" campaign, where I announced actions I’m taking to prevent sexual assault among college students. As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue working at the federal level to ensure that students have the ability to study in safe environments. http://1.usa.gov/1zKu5Ja	836900719690581
158290607551599	Spring has finally arrived, and that means the Little League baseball season is under way. I was in White Plains, New City, and Haverstraw for Little League Opening Day events to talk with players and parents about the importance of youth development. As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I’ve fought to bolster federal programs that enrich the lives of children, and I will continue to encourage the critical principles of fair play, good sportsmanship, and constructive competition throughout Westchester and Rockland.	831777466869573
158290607551599	In Westchester County, there are at least 2,500 unfilled positions in fields that require a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. That’s why I was proud to be in Dobbs Ferry this morning for the ribbon cutting ceremony of the Mercy College STEM Research Center, which was made possible by a $3.7 million federal Department of Education grant I helped secure in 2011. This grant will help provide Mercy College students with the skills critical to obtaining the jobs of today and tomorrow and will strengthen the area economy.  As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue fighting for increased education funding to ensure hardworking New Yorkers can find jobs. http://1.usa.gov/1ObkMbr	831432480237405
158290607551599	This afternoon, I joined Nutrition Site Manager Kerri Ann Montano and local seniors for the Mt. Kisco Senior Nutrition Program’s  40th Anniversary celebration. The program is supported in part by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding, and offers a healthy diet, physical activity, and Medicare information that can make a world of difference for retirees. As Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee, I will fight to prevent cuts to programs that help seniors have a secure and enjoyable retirement.	824373120943341
158290607551599	I appreciate Secretary Kerry's tireless efforts and the diplomatic goals set out by President Obama. \n\nWhile the framework laid out by President Obama and Secretary Kerry has positive aspects, far too many details remain undetermined to ensure Congress and the American people that we are on track to permanently and verifiably prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  The agreement must ensure full disclosure, thorough inspections of facilities, and strict verification of compliance.  Iran must allow full and unfettered access to any facility including Parchin, Fordow, Natanz, and others, military or otherwise.  \n\nThe Administration will have a high bar to convince Congress and the American people that this deal is good for our long-term national security and that of our allies, and that it will verifiably prevent Iran from possessing a nuclear weapon.	821583707888949
158290607551599	It was wonderful attending the Spring Valley NAACP 35th Annual Life Membership Breakfast in Stony Point, where I joined others in highlighting the importance of inspiring our youth, so that they may reach for the stars.	819665734747413
158290607551599	It was wonderful attending the Westchester Women’s Research and Education Fund 31st Annual Women’s Hall of Fame induction in Tarrytown yesterday. I had the honor of introducing 2015 inductee Barbara Finkelstein, CEO of Legal Services of Hudson Valley. This event is always the highlight of Women’s History Month and it proves: When women succeed, America succeeds.	819529338094386
158290607551599	I joined Nyack NAACP President Francis Pratt, Temple Beth Torah Rabbi Douglas Kohn, and Rockland Community College (RCC) President Dr. Cliff Wood yesterday in Pearl River at the 2015 RCC Foundation Leadership Award Luncheon, where I vowed to oppose cuts to Pell Grants and student loans, fight for funding for education and job training, and ensure that we do not balance the budget on the backs of students.	819526981427955
158290607551599	The House Republican Budget resolution passed earlier this week would cut Pell Grants, end higher education tax credits, make subsidized federal Stafford loans more costly, and end public service loan forgiveness and income-based repayment. I joined administrators and students from Westchester Community College and Pace University today to discuss the devastating impact this would have on local college students and hardworking families. Pell Grants provide nearly $80 million in relief for low-income students in Westchester and Rockland to help cover the cost of going to college. We should be investing more in our students, not less. As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I will protect funding for education programs during upcoming spending negotiations. #HigherEd http://1.usa.gov/1CgRvDD	819170354796951
158290607551599	At a hearing last week, I expressed concerns to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs about the unacceptable claims backlog for compensation and pension benefits. Despite decreasing by nearly two-thirds during the last two years, it is important that the VA continue to prioritize this effort so that veterans do not have to needlessly wait for the benefits they earned. I also voted for two pieces of legislation that passed the House: The Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act that would provide veterans with the option to transfer from a traditional nursing home to a VA home health service medical foster home; and H.R. 280 that would authorize the Secretary of the VA to recoup bonuses and awards paid to employees, providing a way to improve employee accountability through performance awards. I will continue ensure our veterans get the support they deserve.	812155848831735
158290607551599	I am disappointed in FERC’s decision to approve the Algonquin Incremental Market Expansion (AIM) project. This decision was made without independent risk analyses, consideration of existing energy sources and transportation routes, and a comprehensive review of the project’s environmental impact on the Lower Hudson Valley. We must prioritize the health and safety of our communities and environment.	809415762439077
158290607551599	I am pleased the House has finally passed a full-year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, providing critical agencies the resources they need to protect our borders, ports, aviation system, and communities. I am hopeful that this experience will make the most extreme elements in Congress think twice about attempting to hold critical funding hostage by way of divisive and ideological riders.	809063815807605
158290607551599	It was wonderful attending the Rockland County Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) Emerald Ball celebration in Pearl River with President of the Rockland County AOH Jim Russell, Grand Marshal of Rockland County’s upcoming 2015 St. Patrick’s Day Parade Vincent Tyre, and Hibernian of the Year Linda Sheridan.	808707172509936
158290607551599	Among my highest priorities in the U.S. Congress is affirming and strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship, and it has been a focus of my entire career.  \n\nThe strength of the U.S.-Israel relationship is rooted in its bipartisanship. Support for Israel is based not on politics, but on shared values and mutual challenges. That is why I will attend Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech before a joint session of Congress – out of recognition of the seriousness of our shared security challenges and out of respect for Bibi himself, whom I have known for nearly 30 years.  \n\nI am extremely disappointed by the way Speaker Boehner has chosen to handle this speech. It is highly irresponsible to inject partisanship in the U.S.-Israel relationship, and the U.S. government should not be seen as interfering in any way with Israel’s upcoming democratic election. I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu to convey these concerns and suggest alternative arrangements to meet with lawmakers.\n\nThe U.S.-Israel relationship will endure far beyond tomorrow’s address and will remain rooted in a long-standing bipartisanship based on shared values and mutual interest.	808698452510808
158290607551599	I spoke with NTSB Board Member Robert Sumwalt this afternoon, and I will be working with the agency to explore investing in new technologies that could help prevent tragic grade crossing accidents like the one at #MetroNorth this week.	797834636930523
158290607551599	On this day in 1964, the 24th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, eliminating the poll tax and providing access to the polls for Americans seeking to exercise their solemn right to vote. I’m confounded that, in several states, burdensome voting restrictions have been placed on American citizens in an effort to prevent them from casting their vote. To deny a law-abiding citizen the right to vote is simply un-American, and I will continue to working hard to ensure that access to the polls is a fact of life for every American.	792288107485176
551199354892891	On the longest day of the year, we stand together and recognize those we have lost, those who continue to fight, and the families and caregivers affected by Alzheimer’s disease. Now more than ever, it is critical that we continue to fund research and programs to find an cure. I will keep fighting to ensure that Congress makes ending this disease a priority, and remember all those affected by Alzheimer’s.	1007822369230585

131326196940421	I periodically re-post the community guidelines for this page, typically after a user has been banned. Thankfully, it’s rarely necessary to take that action. It's my policy not to hide critical comments on this page, and I want constituents to be able to freely communicate and discuss ideas. Good faith criticism is a part of that, and as my mother used to say, "If they're criticizing you, they're leaving someone else alone." That said, attacking others or using obscene or profane language will result in your post being removed. Multiple offenses will result in a user being banned. Also this is an official page - campaign references must be removed to comply with House rules. Thank you for your cooperation.	857950697611297

170477096312258	The #FaithitForward initiative aims to highlight people of faith who make a difference in their communities. Since I was first elected, I've visited many businesses, churches, and other organizations where faith plays a major role. One great example is the Pregnancy Health Center in Mahoning County, where I had an inspiring and moving visit with many of the center's board members. Believing every life matters, the center offers help and hope to individuals affected by an unplanned pregnancy. They also have a men's ministry dedicated to helping young men who are about to become first-time fathers.\n \nPeople of faith often serve tirelessly behind the scenes to better our communities. Let's join together to recognize their hard work and faithful acts of service; you can share your own stories at Faith it Forward	1137824366244188

On Saturday, the Beck Center for the Arts in Lakewood hosted an event titled "From Refugee to Neighbor, Stories from the CLE."

252633384817156	Happy Father's Day!  It’s a great time to remember that #Paidfamilyleave is good for fathers and for families. The U.S. is one of only three countries in the world that doesn’t provide paid time off when a new child joins the family.

252633384817156	The horrific attack on the Emanuel AME Church in South Carolina leaves me devastated and heartbroken. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Charleston and across the country who are grieving from the loss of their family and friends. Based on what we know about the attack, it appears that it was not merely a hate crime, but an act of terror fueled by racism. \n \nI long for the day when African-Americans no longer need to live under fear of violence committed because of their race. \n \nAnd in coming weeks and months, I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to both confront systemic racism in this country and to seek policy solutions that end gun violence.	853987661348389

94156528752	Today, I want to salute some Lancaster County residents who spend their lives serving the vulnerable.\n\nIn 1984, a group of five homemakers in their late twenties were discussing their pro-life beliefs. They wanted to do more than just speak out. They wanted to be there to be help, and to give as much practical support and education for women as possible. \n\nAt first, there was one staff member, and 30 volunteers. Today, there are 25 staffers and 300 volunteers from a broad spectrum of Christian denominations, all united in one purpose.\n\nThe mission of Susquehanna Valley Pregnancy Services (SVPS) is to “share the gospel of Jesus Christ and uphold the sacredness of human life through sexual integrity education, unplanned pregnancy intervention, and post-abortion restoration.” \n\n“Front and center,” says SVPS President Lisa Hosler, who has worked for SVPS for thirty years, “is wanting to serve people, and to do so in a way that points them to a relationship with the Lord.”\n\nEach year, SVPS serves about 1,200 women at 3,000 appointments, such as with free ultrasounds, free pregnancy tests, individual counseling, and group classes on prenatal and parenting education for women and men alike. Since 1985, they have reached nearly 27,000 women and men with pregnancy intervention and post-abortion restoration, and 95,000 students through abstinence and date rape education.\n\nFor decades, they have lived out their mission by serving the most vulnerable people in the world—the unborn and the newly born—who might otherwise not have had a chance at life. They minister to women and men in difficult circumstances, the poor, and the underserved.\n\nThey serve others because of their faith in a God Who is rich in kindness, abounding in love and compassion, and Whose mercy endures forever. They give without pay because they have received without pay from the tender right hand of Almighty God. Thousands of Pennsylvanians in Lancaster County and Lebanon County have been blessed through them. As St. Paul said, God “comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.”\n\nDo you have a story to tell? If so, you can join with me in sharing the selfless work that people of faith are carrying out each and every day.

188649667827713	I would like to start by saying that I am disappointed that the conversation in South Carolina -- largely driven by those outside our state -- has been focused on a flag, rather than the victims of a heinous crime and their courageous and forgiving families.  While I always welcome debate on a divisive issue, I prefer that debate not come on the heels of a tragedy before the victims have even been laid to rest.  \n\nIn part because of those concerns, I will admit that I have not been as quick to call for the removal of the Confederate Flag from the State House grounds as some others.  I remember that the flag is where it is as the result of something that is becoming all too rare in politics: compromise.  Indeed, moving the flag from the dome to the grounds in 2000 — and the concomitant establishment of the African-American monument — could be considered as a high point in South Carolina politics: a time when people got together and worked through their differences in a way that all could accept with pride. \n\nAnd my initial reaction to calls to summarily remove the flag was that such an action would be tantamount to admitting what is not true for many South Carolinians: that the flag is a symbol of hate.  Yes, it was for Dylann Roof.  In fact, for him it was something even more evil than just hate.  But we typically do not allow such people to define what our symbols mean.\n\nBut in speaking with many people over the course of the last few days, it has become clear that the flag does in fact mean different things to different people in our state.  And I blame myself for not listening closely enough to people who see the flag differently than I do. It is a poor reflection on me that it took the violent death of my former desk mate in the SC Senate, and eight others of the best the Charleston community had to offer,  to open my eyes to that.  And because of those very different — and very valid — impressions of what the flag represented, I admit that the flag has become a distraction: something that prevents us from talking about all that is good about South Carolina.  It strikes me as particularly disappointing, for example, that we have spent more time talking about the flag for the last few days than we have talking about the extraordinary display of faith, love, and forgiveness shown by the families of the victims of the shooting in Charleston.  If the flag has become an excuse for people to ignore things like that, then perhaps time has come for a change.\n\nI hope that the Legislature can do the same thing now that they did 15 years ago:  take the time and effort to fashion a compromise that removes the flag in a way that all South Carolinians can rally around with pride and respect — and with the sense of community that has been on display for the world to see in Charleston in the aftermath of last Wednesday evening.  By doing that we will once again have the opportunity to show everyone what is special about our state.  Maybe with the flag removed, people will listen.\n\nFinally, I will say this: there is no Confederate flag flying at the state capitol in Missouri, yet Ferguson had race riots; there is no Confederate flag flying at the state capitol in Maryland, yet Baltimore had race riots.  There is a Confederate flag flying on the grounds of the state capitol in South Carolina, yet Charleston set an example for the world to marvel at in its response to this atrocity.  And of that, I am extraordinarily proud.  Perhaps those who are now trying to focus attention on the flag are spending their time on the wrong things.	1180518348640835
188649667827713	Well, I know we cancelled this and rescheduled it, and that probably accounts for some of the light turnout for the FBQA. Or maybe it's just the heat (but more likely the time of day).  Anyway, we will be back here again next week -- at least once and maybe several times, as I am home in the district all next week.

127744320598870	This whole notion that the Confederate Battle Flag is a flag that people lost their lives under is a myth. It is a flag of rebellion. Legislators and citizens in South Carolina have now seen that it's time to bring our state together by taking the flag off the Statehouse grounds and put it in a museum.	962899410416686

403403083083104	Members of your South Carolina Congressional Delegation gathered on the U.S. House of Representatives Floor tonight in memory of the nine South Carolinians who lost their lives last week in Charleston. Congressman Mark Sanford spoke on behalf of our delegation and read the names of each victim. Then, the entire chamber joined together in a moment of silence to #PrayforCharleston and the victims' families.	857332057690202
403403083083104	I was born in South Carolina.  My family and Wrenzie's have lived here for 7 generations and over 200 years.  At least 2 of my ancestors fought in the Civil War. \n\nWith the exception of 2 years after college, Wrenzie and I have lived our entire lives in South Carolina.  We raised our family right here.  I know it's history.  We aren't perfect, nobody is, but I'm proud of my South Carolina roots, and would never leave her.\n\nToday our Governor called to ask that I stand with her, U.S. Senator Tim Scott, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, Congressman James E. Clyburn, Congressman Mark Sanford, and other elected officials to ask the state legislature to remove the Confederate Flag from the grounds of the Statehouse. This is not an easy decision. The flag is an important part of our history, and is revered by many as a symbol of honor and sacrifice.\n\nBut to many South Carolinians it is a symbol of division and hate.  Hate groups have co-opted the flag as a symbol of their movement.  Horrific crimes have been committed by madmen wrapped in the Confederate Flag.\n\nThe Confederate Flag will always have a place in our history, but in my opinion, that place should be an honored area in a museum. Not on the grounds of our Statehouse.	856658334424241

145110472209094	Proud to have just voted to repeal the infamous Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) contained in the Affordable Care Act. This board of 15 unelected bureaucrats has the power to cut Medicare payments for medical procedures without first getting Congress's approval. Not only will this severely diminish the patient-doctor relationship, it will mean senior's would no longer have access to certain medical treatments. I commend my Tennessee colleague and fellow physician Dr. Phil Roe for leading the bipartisan effort to repeal the IPAB.	846358602084274

As a staunch believer in the military doctrine that we leave no man or woman behind, I was proud to introduce House Resolution 323, calling upon the Government of Mexico to expedite the repatriation process. It is my hope that these soldiers will be returned home in a timely manner so that our grateful nation may give them the proper burial they deserve.	843873255666142

6470828395	The Congressional Prayer Caucus launched the #FaithItForward initiative today to help highlight and share the positive impact faith has on communities all across the country. Today I'd like to share with you the story of Tommy Lee, Lesa and their daughter Abigail Kidd, a remarkable family from Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. At her 20th week of pregnancy, doctors warned Lesa of life-threatening issues with her baby Abigail. Undeterred, Lesa continued her pregnancy and the family has enjoyed a full and blessed life as influential advocates for people with Down syndrome.\n\nTommy Lee and Lesa created Abigail’s Plan, a non-profit organization dedicated to raising funds to build a totally rubberized baseball field in Lawrenceburg, the first such effort in Tennessee. Abigail’s Plan has raised over $350,000 to build this field which will be accessible to players with and without disabilities. Money for the field was donated by area churches, banks, Rotary-sponsored races, local businesses, charities and citizens of Lawrence County. \n\nAbigail’s Plan’s next venture is to raise funds for three new playgrounds around Lawrence County which will also be accessible to children with and without disabilities alike. \n\nTommy Lee serves as Chairman of the Tennessee Council on Developmental Disabilities. The Kidd family was named Lawrence County Citizens of the Year in 2014 and received the Governor’s Volunteer Star Award in 2015. From 2002 through 2007, the family raised over $60,000 for the Middle TN Down Syndrome Association. Tommy Lee, Lesa and Abigail have raised awareness about people with disabilities, both at home in Lawrenceburg and around the region. Thank you for your exemplary work and continued efforts to engage and empower people who have disabilities.	10153370901468396

6470828395	On this Father’s Day, I want to thank all the fathers who encourage, love and support their children like mine did. It’s often through our fathers that we find our purpose in life and the confidence to achieve it.  \n\nSeveral years back, I wrote a foreword for a book on fatherhood that Mark White, a State Representative from Memphis wrote entitled, “May I Call You Dad-Why Fathers Are Needed In the Home.”    \n \nIn it, I wrote about how my passion for serving came from my father who believed in me and instilled core concepts of faith, family, freedom, hope and opportunity in my life. As a child, my dad affirmed in me his belief that I was an exceptional young lady who had the ability to become an exceptional person, that I had the freedom to choose what, when and where to study, to work, to achieve and succeed. He made certain that each of his children knew what the mind could believe and conceive, it could achieve. I encourage you to read the entire foreword below and thank your own father or father figure for the role they play in your life.	10153359337563396

They've been kind to share some of their client quotes, which I find to be truly inspiring!\n\nClaudia: “When I first came to PPC I was scared about my baby’s future and her quality of life.  Thanks to the help and advice of PPC, I was thankful for the new life that was growing inside of me.  The people at PPC are friendly and respectful.”\n\nLaura: “The Pregnancy Center was the best thing that happened to us.  Everyone was very nice and understanding.”\n\nEdith: “PPC helped me realize that my daughter is a miracle from God.  She has brought so much happiness to our lives.”\n\nMegan: “Thank you so much for all your support and encouragement.  Your guys made me believe I could do it!”\n\nBecky: “Thank God for you!

15617630596	Rep. Barton mourns the loss of fellow Aggie and friend, John David Crow\n\nWASHINGTON: Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) issued the following statement Thursday.\n\nJohn David Crow was not only a great athlete, Heisman Trophy Award winner, and advocate for Texas A&M – he was a great person. John David Crow excelled on the football field in college and in the NFL. After his playing days were over, he returned to Texas A&M and served in a multitude of roles, including Athletic Director. \n\nWhen I was a young Congressman representing the College Station area, he went out of his way to be a friend and strengthen my relationship with the University.  I visited with John David Crow and his wife, Carolyn, many times in Washington, College Station, and at the Cotton Bowl. I will miss him as an icon of Texas A&M and a friend.	10155723746750597

460776160654909	Today the House passed H.R. 1190, a bill to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) that was created under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  I voted in support of H.R. 1190.\n\nThe 2010 ACA legislation included a provision that created a 15 member IPAB board that replaced the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), which historically had made recommendations to Congress regarding options for controlling Medicare costs.  Unlike MedPAC, however, the recommendations made by the IPAB to Congress on controlling Medicare costs would be binding and become the law of the land unless Congress passed legislation otherwise.  To date, no one has been appointed to the board, and the growth in Medicare costs that would trigger the recommendations has yet to happen.\n\nI voted in support of H.R. 1190 because I do not think Congress should relinquish its authority, responsibility, or accountability in finding solutions to controlling future Medicare costs.  I also believe this legislation is a way to improve the ACA.	978357292230124

407767916003589	For our #FaithitForward today, we are highlighting the Round Rock Area Serving Center, a Texas non-profit that carries out a community-wide mission of churches, other organizations and individuals serving human needs in the City of Round Rock and surrounding areas. The Serving Center has been operating a food pantry since 1986.    When people are in need, they go from church to church for help.   The Serving Center was created by the local churches in 1986 (incorporated in 1987) to be one central place for people to go.   In 1990, it was reported that 1,100 families had been helped for the entire year.   Today, the Serving Center is assisting 1,100 households every month.  \n\nwww.rrasc.org	785646934882350

130802746950682	Bishop States that Congress Must Focus on Cutting Spending\n\nWASHINGTON-- Representative Rob Bishop (UT-01) voted against H.R. 8 this evening because the legislation failed to prevent sequestration from occurring and did not adequately address reckless government spending.\n\n"Our goal was always to protect as many Americans as possible from tax increases and to cut spending.  There are good things about this deal, like the fact that taxes are reduced for most people and the AMT fix and death tax rates are made permanent. Up until very recently, virtually no Democrats were talking about extending the tax cuts, and today, Congress made most of the tax cuts permanent.  Those are all positives. If the Senate had just stopped there, this deal would have been much better than it ended up. Unfortunately, Democrats in control of the White House and Senate avoided real spending cuts and insisted on too much revenue. They included things like raising dividend taxes, increasing the highest rate within the death tax, which was not necessary, and most importantly for our area, doing nothing on sequestration. They just kicked it down the road for two months and I have no confidence that the Administration or the Senate are serious about coming back and really solving this military funding problem."	517036951660591

135654683137079	The shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, makes painfully clear again that our country must do more to fight racism and stop gun violence. \n \nMy thoughts are with the families and communities of the nine people who died in Charleston. The South Carolina government should stand up to this tragic act of violence and take down the confederate flag flying on the state capitol grounds. The flag’s symbolism only stands to hurt the healing process.\n \nIt is unacceptable that guns have heartbreakingly and permanently altered our schools, churches, homes and communities. While no single law can prevent the actions of a killer, that is no excuse not to act. Congress should reinstate the assault weapons ban, ban high-capacity ammunition clips, close the gun show and private sale loopholes, and strengthen background check requirements. \n \nSadly our country has not seen the end of violent crimes. But if Congress acts, we can make our communities safer and shrink this cycle of violence.	865816370120903
135654683137079	Thanks to Bob Anderson for putting together a meeting on Guemes Island yesterday. Issues included trade/tpa, gun safety, AUMF, climate change, veterans and ferries.

135654683137079	Today I voted in favor of the 2015 Trade Promotion Authority bill to open up new markets for businesses of all sizes in my district to sell their goods overseas and create jobs here at home. The TPA bill gives the President the authority he needs to finalize trade agreements based on strong direction from Congress. And the bill will help level the playing field for our workers while upholding labor and environmental protections we have worked so hard in this country to achieve.\n\nThere is more work to do to strengthen our country’s approach to trade by renewing Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). The TAA program has helped workers whose jobs have been hurt by trade for the last 40 years, because Democrats understood the job shifts likely to result from an increasingly global economy. In recent years, TAA has helped nearly 2,900 workers in the Second Congressional District and more than 17,500 workers in Washington state with job training and income support.\n\nThe TAA measure before the House renews the program for six years, the longest extension since 1986, with $450 million of funding each year. It also expands who is eligible for the program’s benefits.\n\nI supported TAA when the House voted last week, and I remain committed to the program. We had the chance to pass the program in tandem with TPA, but Democrats blocked it and TAA failed. I expect the House to reconsider TAA, and I look forward to voting for TAA again.	864105273625346

Together, Washingtonians will carry on his legacy.	10153443116494772
450819048314124	The cutting-edge technologies of tomorrow should not be developed somewhere else. We should give our scientists and researchers in the United States the tools they need to turn the dreams of tomorrow into reality. Unfortunately, the U.S. ranks 10th in overall research and development (R&D) investments. In fact, China is expected to outspend the U.S in R&D in the next ten years. Today, American business leaders released Innovation Imperative – calling on members of Congress to support investments in innovation so that we can ensure the U.S. remains globally competitive. I will continue to fight for America’s greatest angel investor – Uncle Sam – so scientific breakthroughs and accomplishments continue to be discovered in labs and garages on our shores.	892194680843223
450819048314124	I had a great day in Kitsap yesterday. I'd like to thank all the staff from the Bremerton Housing Authority for welcoming me to their offices and asking good questions during our town hall.

450819048314124	Every member of my family went to the UW, so I was raised to root for the Huskies and against the Cougars. I admitted to Elson Floyd recently that -- having worked with him over the years and having admired his leadership -- I suddenly found myself rooting for WSU too. I was proud to call Elson a friend and partner. Presiding during a challenging time in our economy, he never hesitated to make the tough decisions that he believed would be best for his university, his students, and for all of higher education. Our state is stronger for his leadership, not just in Pullman but in communities like Bremerton where people got new opportunities because he made it a priority. He will be sorely missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and with the entire WSU community.	890581201004571

246418928093	Today, I supported the passage of H.R. 2048, the #USAFREEDOM Act. This legislation will end domestic bulk data collection under the PATRIOT Act, restore civil liberties protections, and increase government transparency. We still have work to do to rein in the government’s surveillance powers, but this commonsense legislation is an important step in the right direction.	10153298111383094
246418928093	Last week, I had the privilege of traveling to Israel and the West Bank. I participated in a series of constructive meetings with Israeli, Palestinian and American leaders on the complexities that persist in the region.

Claire, along with winners from across the country, will travel to Washington, DC in June. Her piece will hang in the U.S. Capitol for the next year.

246418928093	Today the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on #MarriageEquality.

246418928093	Student loan debt is crushing an entire generation of Americans. Students, parents and even grandparents are struggling to pay off loans with interest rates sometimes as high as 10%. For millions of young adults, student loans are preventing them from buying a home, starting a family and moving on with their lives. Today I’m announcing legislation I filed in the House of Representatives that would provide much needed relief for students and parents by allowing them to refinance their student loans at a much lower rate. It would also provide increased bankruptcy protections to holders of private student loans. Read about my new plan here ---> http://1.usa.gov/18yDXsw	10153157258283094
246418928093	Today the FCC voted to protect and promote the open internet. I believe that in order to continue being a hotbed of competition and innovation, the internet must remain a level playing field. Today’s vote by the FCC paved the way for future innovators and hundreds of small companies struggling to develop the next Amazon, Zillow or Tableau. I want to thank all of my constituents who joined me in calling on the FCC to take the necessary step of reclassifying internet service providers under Title II of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. #NetNeutrality	10153113497138094
246418928093	I am appalled by the hateful acts of vandalism that have shaken the Bothell community this week. Instead of preparing to celebrate the Great Night of Shiva, members of the Bothell temple were confronting intolerable acts of hate and ignorance. These cowardly acts will not be tolerated in Washington State, or anywhere. Washington State has long been a welcoming home to many diverse constituencies, including a vibrant Hindu community that has undoubtedly been an important part of what makes our state great. These events do not reflect the values of diversity and inclusivity that our community has come to know and expect.  While I am saddened by these events, I am confident that the Hindu community will remain resilient and move forward from this act of ignorance.	10153090031143094
246418928093	Yesterday I joined my Washington State colleagues  in settling our #SuperBowlXLIX bet with the Massachusetts delegation.

246418928093	I applaud my colleagues in the House who voted in overwhelmingly bi-partisan fashion (410-0) to pass the Strengthening Child Welfare Response to Trafficking Act of 2015.  As an original co-sponsor, a child psychiatrist and co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, I applaud everyone’s bipartisan work on this important legislation.  This bill is another step forward in our urgent mission to stop sex trafficking and to forge a just, healthy foster care system for children and families; a system fully capable of helping families in need and helping foster children grow to be healthy, productive adults.	10153041228598094
246418928093	I have been calling for a debate on the use of military force against ISIL for six months.  I am encouraged to see that President Obama will call for Congressional authorization in his State of the Union address this evening. Whether or not Congress will honor the President’s request for an AUMF is now up to us.  As Members of Congress, we must carefully weigh the perils of deploying U.S. military personnel for a third time in a decade. And once the relevant committees present specific and prudent language for us to debate, it is the responsibility of Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader McConnell to bring an AUMF resolution to the floor for a rigorous debate and a vote.  That is what America’s sons and daughters who will be put in harm’s way in Iraq and Syria deserve.  http://1.usa.gov/1KZd1Bs	10153027058533094
246418928093	Republicans in Congress got burned for shutting the government down last year.  They are clearly not going to let that happen again.  However, their price for keeping the government running is a 2015 Omnibus Bill that contains a pair of unacceptable provisions.  \nThe first is a legislative rider, bought and paid for by bank lobbyists, that loosens regulation on risky derivatives trading.   It is inconceivable that Congress would cut crucial regulations in the Dodd-Frank Act, when risky derivatives trading was at the center of the 2008 financial crisis.\nSecondly, I have grave reservations about the billions of dollars appropriated to the Pentagon to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria.  Exactly what this money will be spent on has not been openly and thoroughly debated on the House Floor.  Congress essentially has no idea how these expenditures fit into a comprehensive strategy in Iraq, or how much more money might be needed to combat ISIS in the coming months or years.   \nI will be voting NO on this bill.  Sadly, the 2015 Omnibus Bill shows that Congress has not learned crucial lessons when it comes to calamitous derivatives trading or costly proxy wars in the Middle East.	10152901586053094

246418928093	Thanks to the tireless work of Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, her predecessor Senator Rockefeller, and the intrepid Committee staff, we now have an official, comprehensive, and damning report on the Central Intelligence Agency’s detention and interrogation policies. Building on legislation I introduced in 2009, I will continue to fight for the official codification of President Obama’s Executive Order 13491, which brought an end to CIA “black sites” and “enhanced interrogation techniques,” but which is not yet part of U.S. law. \nI also firmly believe the entire 6,700 page report should be fully declassified, which will undoubtedly be another uphill battle for transparency and intelligence reform. The release of this report today may be controversial, but it is the right thing to do.  We are a nation of laws, under which every person, friend or foe, must be treated fairly and humanely.	10152899822223094

246418928093	Today, at Evergreen Washelli Memorial Cemetery, I joined King County Councilmember Rod Dembrowski, his father (a WWII vet), and hundreds of other veterans, family members and thankful citizens in honoring those who have served our country in the armed forces.	10152840086673094
246418928093	My thoughts and prayers - and those of my entire staff - are with the students, faculty, and families - the entire community - of Marysville.	10152800540893094
246418928093	Many thanks to Mayor Carla Nichols and the Woodway Town Council for the opportunity to discuss some of the issues that matter most to our community.  Issues such as climate change, the global response to Ebola, health reform and gun control.  It was a pleasure to meet so many residents of Woodway last evening.	10152794120978094
246418928093	Yesterday's groundbreaking for another section of SR520 will extend the road closer, but not quite to I-5. The event took place on hallowed ground. The "ramps to nowhere," which are coming down, represent an early victory in the environmental movement: neighbors got together and stopped the RH Thompson Expressway that was planned to cut through the Arboretum and obliterate much of the Central District. We won that fight and we also won the fight to make the new SR520 transit, bike and environmentally friendly.	10152782592863094
246418928093	Today, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that – thanks to the Affordable Care Act – the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) received an additional $283 million in funding during fiscal year 2014. The NHSC’s scholarship and loan forgiveness programs are essential to training a robust primary care workforce that meets the needs of underserved communities in Washington and across the country. However, the NHSC faces a funding cliff next year, and without prompt action the future of these crucial programs is in jeopardy. Moving forward, one of Congress’s top priorities must be extending NHSC funding and creating a new “RDOCS” program to provide free medical education to primary care doctors who serve in underserved areas. These bold investments in the health care workforce are necessary if we want to solve our national primary care crisis and ensure that quality health care is reality for all Americans.	10152763610443094
246418928093	Thank You to Dean Azita Emami for the opportunity to address the faculty/staff of the Univ. of Washington School of Nursing - the nation's #1 school of nursing since 1984.  Go Huskies.\nFacebook.com/uwnursing	10152759862488094
246418928093	Today, Transportation Secretary Foxx, Senator Murray and I celebrated the announcement of a $20m federal grant to modernize the Port of Seattle's Terminal 46.  This work will allow the port to be competitive long into the future and welcome the world's largest container ships.  Federal investment is crucial to ensure that our ports are the best in the world.	10152754787803094
246418928093	Good Yontiv to all my friends in our Jewish community. I wish you all a fulfilling day of reflection and atonement and good luck to those who choose to fast.	10152745592813094

288586617834523	The Export Import Bank plays a critical role in helping small and large businesses to export goods and compete in the global marketplace.  In FY 2014, it supported 164,000 American jobs and over $27 billion in exports.  And it does all of this while generating money and reducing the federal deficit.  Congress should reauthorize the #ExImBank before it expires.  #ExIm4Jobs	1146459455380564
547907568553615	This weekend I joined folks at Puyallup Main Street Association's annual Puyallup Meeker Days Festival to celebrate the beginning of summer. The downtown was buzzing with the farmers market, live music, a kids zone, delicious local food and even a Buick car show. Congratulations to Michelle McGill, Benji Bittle and Dan Stats with the Main Street Association for another record breaking festival this year! \n\nWhat are you looking forward to this summer?	1012067992137568
547907568553615	Sometimes tragedies are so horrific, they are hard to process. A moment of silence, some tears, and some prayers may be the best immediate response. Later, but soon, we should have the conversation about why this seems to keep happening in one nightmarish iteration or another.	1010087599002274
130377260362609	What better way to celebrate West Virginia's birthday than remembering the "father of West Virginia," Francis Pierpont, with a dedication of a statue in his honor.	877600788973582
130377260362609	Our veterans deserve the best care and attention from our government. Recently, they haven't been getting it. Today, I sat down with some of Marshall County's veteran leaders, young and old, to discuss the challenges they see for West Virginia's veterans.	877247862342208
100997129276	It was great to hear from residents of Newburg, Kewaskum, Allenton and Jackson today.

Check here for when I'll be holding a meeting near you: http://1.usa.gov/1koESvb	10153136055869277
100997129276	I just voted in favor of H.R. 30, the Save American Workers Act, to restore the 40-hour work week, which was unraveled by Obamacare's employer mandate. It passed 252-172.	10152946184564277
100997129276	As a reminder, all students seeking my nomination to a U.S. Service Academy must have their completed application into my Brookfield office by 5 p.m. today!  I will not be accepting late or incomplete applications.  If you have any questions, please contact my District Office at (262)784-1111.	10152731339344277
100997129276	I would like to thank Anthony, Clement, Joey and Dominic for their service as interns this summer! My office is currently accepting resumes for fall and spring interns in both my Washington Office as well as my District Office in Brookfield.	10152615637104277
100997129276	I enjoyed spending the weekend with constituents in Watertown, Juneau, Iron Ridge, Reeseville and Hartland!	10152576867894277
100997129276	I had a busy weekend throughout Wisconsin visiting with people in Greenfield, Menomonee Falls, Lebanon, Pewaukee, Rubicon and at the Washington County Fair!  Last night I held a town hall meeting in West Bend.  Thank you to everyone who attended!	10152544269589277
100997129276	It was great to visit with constituents in Waukesha, Hartford, North Lake, West Allis, Greenfield and Juneau this weekend!	10152528510204277
100997129276	I had a great time this weekend meeting with constituents throughout the 5th Congressional District.	10152513606499277
100997129276	This administration’s lack of accountability is an insult to all the brave men and women who have fought for our country. If Secretary Shinseki does not resign, he should be fired. The buck must stop somewhere.	10152405632564277
100997129276	Today at 1:00 p.m., the House Judiciary Committee will markup the USA FREEDOM Act (H.R. 3361). It will be streamed live at www.c-span.org and judiciary.house.gov.	10152357951859277
100997129276	All three branches of government have said the NSA has gone too far. Even President Obama’s hand-picked panel agrees that bulk collection by the NSA has come at a high cost to privacy without improving national security. This problem cannot be solved by presidential fiat. Congress needs to pass the USA FREEDOM Act.	10152105576264277
100997129276	My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of today's attack at the Navy Yard in DC.	10151830104974277
100997129276	The Voting Rights Act is vital to America’s commitment to never again permit racial prejudices in the electoral process. Section 5 of the Act was a bipartisan effort to rectify past injustices and ensure minorities’ ability to participate in elections, but the threat of discrimination still exists.  I am disappointed by the Court’s ruling, but my colleagues and I will work in a bipartisan fashion to update Section 4 to ensure Section 5 can be properly implemented to protect voting rights, especially for minorities. This is going to take time and will require members from both sides of the aisle to put partisan politics aside and ensure Americans’ most sacred right is protected.	10151654475864277
100997129276	The IRS unjustly targeted conservative and patriotic groups. Apparently, not only is our tax code broken, but so is the agency tasked with enforcing it. A mere apology from the IRS is insufficient. This is a perfect example of why the American people have so little trust in their government.	10151576903254277
100997129276	I introduced a bill today to protect motorcyclists’ rights and promote crash prevention as the most effective use of taxpayer money to save motorcyclists’ lives. The bill will also prohibit the federal government from providing grants to states to create motorcycle only checkpoints.	10151563359024277
100997129276	United Way sent a letter to members of the House Ways and Means Committee encouraging them to consider H.R. 1479, a bill I introduced with Congressman Matheson. This bi-partisan effort emphasizes the importance of charitable deductions to ensure that Washington does not dissuade giving.  Americans appreciate the significance of our philanthropic sector as charity is ingrained in our moral fiber. \n\nI am honored United Way supports my bill and applaud the great services our local United Ways in Waukesha, Watertown and West Bend provide for people in our community.	10151543519014277
100997129276	Hard-working taxpayers across the country understand that you can’t spend more than you take in. Washington must learn to do the same.  Everyone knows Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem.  The tax code needs to be reformed to make it fairer and less burdensome. How do you think the tax code could be simplified?	10151531723079277
100997129276	Our thoughts are prayers go out to all those affected by today's tragic event in Boston.	10151527397054277
100997129276	I'll be on FOX Business tonight around 6:30 EST talking E15 policy. Tune in!	10151262997019277
100997129276	My thoughts and prayers are with the victims’ families and loved ones, and with the survivors of yesterday’s horrific shooting. During this difficult time, our community will come together to offer comfort and strength to the survivors and others impacted by this violent and senseless act. Today the City of Brookfield Police Department gave my office an updated briefing. I commend the remarkable joint efforts on the part of our local, state, and federal law enforcement. We are extremely thankful for their brave service and quick response on the scene.	10151198538169277
100997129276	I will be on Newsradio 620 WTMJ with Charles Sykes this morning in half an hour. Listen in!	10151183862829277
100997129276	The violent assault on Americans serving in Libya is a tragic loss for our country and we condemn these attacks. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of Ambassador Stevens and the three staff members who were killed. These Americans served their country with courage and we will not forget their sacrifice.	10151142490359277
157169920997203	We need multi-year highway program reauthorizations that reduce and streamline regulations and restore local control of transportation projects. Our national infrastructure system provides a platform for our economy to operate, and Americans across the country agree that something needs to be done. \nRead more: http://thehill.com/opinion/op-ed/245158-time-to-save-our-infrastructure	842553799125475
